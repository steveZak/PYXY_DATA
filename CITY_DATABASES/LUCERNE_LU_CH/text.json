        "wiki": "The Kapellbr\u00fccke (literally, Chapel Bridge) is a covered wooden footbridge spanning the river Reuss diagonally in the city of Lucerne in central Switzerland. Named after the nearby St. Peter's Chapel, the bridge is unique in containing a number of interior paintings dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with a larger part of the centuries-old bridge in a 1993 fire. Subsequently restored, the Kapellbr\u00fccke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge. It serves as the city's symbol and as one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPart of the bridge complex is the octagonal 34.5 m (113 ft) tall (from ground) Wasserturm, which translates to \"water tower,\" in the sense of 'tower standing in the water.' The tower pre-dated the bridge by about 30 years. Over the centuries, the tower has been used as a prison, torture chamber, and later a municipal archive as well as a local treasury. Today, the tower is closed to the public, although it houses a local artillery association and a tourist gift shop.The bridge itself was originally built c.1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications. It linked the old town on the right bank of the Reuss to the new town on the left bank, securing the town from attack from the south (i.e. from the lake). The bridge was initially over 270 metres (890 ft) long, although numerous shortenings over the years and river bank replenishments mean the bridge now totals only 204.7 metres (672 ft) long. It is the oldest surviving truss bridge in the world, consisting of strutted and triangulated trusses of moderate span, supported on piled trestles; as such, it is probably an evolution of the strutted bridge.The Kapellbr\u00fccke almost burned down on 18 August 1993, destroying two thirds of its interior paintings. Shortly thereafter, the Kapellbr\u00fccke was reconstructed and again opened to the public on 14 April 1994 for a total of CHF 3.4 million.\n\n\n== Paintings ==\nLucerne is unique in that its three wooden pedestrian bridges, the 14th-century Hofbr\u00fccke (now destroyed) and Kapellbr\u00fccke and the 16th-century Spreuerbr\u00fccke, all featured painted interior triangular frames. None of Europe's other wooden footbridges have this feature. The paintings, dating back to the 17th century and executed by local Catholic painter Hans Heinrich W\u00e4gmann, depict events from Lucerne's history. Of the original 158 paintings, 147 existed before the 1993 fire. After the fire, the remains of 47 paintings were collected, but ultimately only 30 were fully restored.The wooden boards that held the paintings varied from 150 centimetres (59 in) to 181 centimetres (71 in) wide and 85 centimetres (33 in) to 95 centimetres (37 in) wide. Most of the panels were made from spruce wood boards, and only a few were made from linden wood and maple. The paintings were created during the Counter-Reformation, featuring scenes promoting the Catholic Church. The paintings were sponsored by the city's council members, who, upon sponsoring a panel, were allowed to attribute their personal coat of arms on it. An explanation of each painting was printed below each scene. The paintings ran all along the bridge, dating from the life and death of Lucerne's patron saint St.Leger to the legends of the city's other patron saint St. Maurice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour 360\u00b0 of Chapel Bridge.\nBridges of Lucerne, Official Website, City of Lucerne",

          "This bridge is well worth crossing instead of the modern versions, it keeps you dry from rain as well as the river! After a serious fire some years ago it was restored, but the original paintings in the roof were not reproduced so you can see how much of the bridge was damaged.",
          "This is an iconic spot in Lucerne - get ready to take pictures of the bridge and it's beautiful flowers! It's actually just a lovely short walk across the river - but very scenic, and actually quite historic. I'd recommend lunch along the boardwalk with a view of the bridge.",

          "The Chapel bridge near the railway station and over the river dominates. It's not stunningly aesthetic, but perhaps its history chequered 700-year history compensates. Not grandiose like world-famous bridges such as the Golden Gate or Sydney harbour bridges, as it is just a",
          "We came to Lucerne after landing in Zurich on 23 Sept 2019 & walked around the town. This bridge is indeed symbolic of Lucerne. In fact, there is another similar wooden bridge farther away from the train station, near the dam but has less appeal as it doesn't bloom with flowers.",
          "This is an iconic architecture in city of Lucerne. It is one of the oldest surviving bridge in Switzerland. There are interior paintings as far back as 17th century. Large part of the bridge was destroyed in 1993 due to fire, but it was restored. Hence, smoking is not allowed at",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Lion Monument (German: L\u00f6wendenkmal), or the Lion of Lucerne, is a rock relief in Lucerne, Switzerland, designed by Bertel Thorvaldsen and hewn in 1820\u201321 by Lukas Ahorn. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris. It is one of the most famous monuments in Switzerland, visited annually by about 1.4 million tourists. In 2006 it was placed under Swiss monument protection.Mark Twain praised the sculpture of a mortally wounded lion as \"the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFrom the early 17th century, a regiment of Swiss Guards had served as part of the Royal Household of France. On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI had been forced to move with his family from the Palace of Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris. In June 1791 he tried to flee to Montm\u00e9dy near the frontier, where troops under royalist officers were concentrated. In the 1792 10th of August Insurrection, revolutionaries stormed the palace. Fighting broke out spontaneously after the Royal Family had been escorted from the Tuileries to take refuge with the Legislative Assembly. The Swiss Guards ran low on ammunition and were overwhelmed by superior numbers. A note written by the King half an hour after firing had commenced has survived, ordering the Swiss to retire and return to their barracks. Delivered in the middle of the fighting, this was only acted on after their position had become untenable.Of the Swiss Guards defending the Tuileries, more than six hundred were killed during the fighting or massacred after surrender. An estimated two hundred more died in prison of their wounds or were killed during the September Massacres that followed. Apart from about a hundred Swiss who escaped from the Tuileries, the only survivors of the regiment were a 300 strong detachment which, with the King's authorization, had been sent to Normandy to escort grain convoys a few days before August 10. The Swiss officers were mostly amongst those massacred, although Major Karl Josef von Bachmann \u2014 in command at the Tuileries \u2014 was formally tried and guillotined in September, still wearing his red uniform coat. Two surviving Swiss officers achieved senior rank under Napoleon.\n\n\n== Memorial ==\nThe initiative to create the monument was taken by Karl Pfyffer von Altishofen, an officer of the Guards who had been on leave in Lucerne at that time of the fight. He began collecting money in 1818. The monument was designed by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, and hewn in 1820\u201321 by  Lukas Ahorn, in a former sandstone quarry near Lucerne. Carved into the cliff face, the monument measures ten metres in length and six metres in height.\nThe monument is dedicated Helvetiorum Fidei ac Virtuti (\"To the loyalty and bravery of the Swiss\"). The dying lion is portrayed impaled by a spear, covering a shield bearing the fleur-de-lis of the French monarchy; beside him is another shield bearing the coat of arms of Switzerland. The inscription below the sculpture lists the names of the officers and gives the approximate numbers of soldiers who died (DCCLX = 760), and survived (CCCL = 350).The monument is described by Thomas Carlyle in The French Revolution: A History. The pose of the lion was copied in 1894 by Thomas M. Brady (1849\u20131907) for his Lion of Atlanta in the Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n== Mark Twain on the monument ==\n\nThe Lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low cliff\u2014for he is carved from the living rock of the cliff. His size is colossal, his attitude is noble. His head is bowed, the broken spear is sticking in his shoulder, his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of France. Vines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind, and a clear stream trickles from above and empties into a pond at the base, and in the smooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored, among the water-lilies.\n\nAround about are green trees and grass. The place is a sheltered, reposeful woodland nook, remote from noise and stir and confusion\u2014and all this is fitting, for lions do die in such places, and not on granite pedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings. The Lion of Lucerne would be impressive anywhere, but nowhere so impressive as where he is.\n\n\n== References in literature ==\n\nIn The Chalet School Does It Again (1955) Elinor Brent-Dyer describes the monument, its history and the associated chapel.\nIn The Lions of Lucerne (2002) author Brad Thor describes the monument and the Swiss Guard it commemorates.\nIn her New Yorker tribute \"My Buddy\" (2017), Patti Smith reflects upon the death of Sam Shepard while standing in front of and addressing the monument.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLion Monument, Lucerne, All About Switzerland travelguide.

          "You can obviously see what the monument looks like from all the posted pictures, but to actually know the background and really see it is something. We went in the evening in the light rain so it was dark and quiet, very fittingly peaceful.",
          "Everyone should first do the research on this monument and than visit it...It is as moving as a stone art can be. Perfect",
          "I visited the Lion Monument in December 2019. It is a bit of a walk (15-20 minutes) from the Chapel Bridge but worth it. There was a lot of construction in the area and the only way to see the Lion Monument was to go on a viewing platform. I took some photos, admired it and",
          "Doesnt take too much time. Read the history before you go. Once you have visited, you dont need to see again.",
          "It wasn't as large as I had imagined but it was still worth the walk across town. Very special and good viewing vantages.",
          "The dying lion monument is beautiful and a place to pause and reflect. It is a small area with a pond and gardens and only a short walk from the train station. Unfortunately, tourists and selfie sticks really ruin the mood. I wish people would respect the areas and stop turning",
          "The story behind the monument is emotional, which in turn makes a visit to see it a necessary part of going to Lucerne. To hear the history, to reflect on it as it is in turn reflected in the waters beneath it, creates a sense of awe at the artist who surely wept while carving",
          "This is a quite superbly carved lion and it is quit moving. Apparently this piece of sculpture commemorates the Swiss Guards who defended the Pope.",
          "The lion statue in itself is an beautiful work of art, and therefore a must for any site seer to Luzern. Carved from the rock of an impressive hill side, with a small pool in the foreground. What makes it even more important is the story why it was carved. Do your homework",
          "This is a beautiful carving in the rock depicting a very sad tail. The carving is so good that the lion itself looks very sad. A must see attraction.",
          "Sculpted to commemorate the Swiss Guards who defended the Pope. I\u2019m not religious, but is an excellent depiction of a mortally wounded lion, carved into solid rock in heavy relief. We were there on a dull rainy day and slightly higher than the usual viewpoint, standing on",
          "The Lion of Lucerne is another \u201cmust see\u201d. There isn\u2019t much to do except look at it, but it is a magnificent carving with a great story. Make sure to look carefully to see the pig carved into the rock surrounding the sculpture and ask about that story, too!",
          "The site was interesting but not overwhelming for Linda and I. It was raining and our group was the only one their. The piece did not speak to me, like some of the other we would encounter along the way on this trip.",
          "At the time of our visit, the garden was under reconstruction. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris. It is one of the most famous monuments in Switzerland, visited",
          "Its just ok...not as good as we were expecting and there was some construction work in... 2.5 out of 5 for us",
          "This is a cool statue to see. At first glance it looks like a lion statue sitting inside a carved out hole in the side of the Bluff. It\u2019s all one piece carved into the side, incredibly detailed with a good story behind it too. Not a must see, but worth seeing if your in the area.",
          "commemorating the loss of many members of the Swiss Guard during the French revolution this stone carving in the face of the granite wall is very moving.",
          "Well worth the short walk from the central station. Very impressive and moving monument. An artistic masterpiece.",
          "Firstly it\u2019s a little difficult to find as it is tucked in some alley, way in from the main roads of Luzern city. It\u2019s a wall carving of a large lion with a small shallow pond surrounding it. The lion symbolises the sacrifices made by the Swiss army in their line of duty. Good",
          "Very impressive monument you see on your way by foot to the Gletschergarten museum. The whole area is going now under construction/renovation of the museum. So the pool in front, was not in it's best view.",
          "I\u2019m so glad we took the time to see the Lion Statue. Carved to commemorate the Swiss Guards who were massacred during the French Revolution. It\u2019s oddly peaceful by the small pond. We sat down for quite a while. The carving itself is quite spectacular.",
          "I have been to Lucerne 3 times and have taken people to this monument each time. It is a short walk from our hotel and the chapel bridge. This time the pond was dirty and the area around the monument looked like it needed some care. Some type of construction was going on so",
          "Ha ha... i had been to Luzern many times but never seen the lion..he\u2019s beautiful and worth making the effort, is a bit of a tourist attraction so could be busy,",
          "At a first glance this is merely a carving of a lion on a large stone wall. The lion is injured with a knife stuck in it\u2019s heart but it won\u2019t give up. This is symbolic of the bravery and loyalty of Swiss army who are reputed worldwide particularly for their loyalty. Good thought",
          "Easy walk to overhang that this is seen from.....be sure to have someone to tell the story of the how the Lion came to be and how the sculptor supposedly worked some \"suggestions\" in the sculpture to send a message to the people....So much history and the story is fascinating",
          "The place is so serene and your jaw simply drops at the glance of this masterpiece! There are benches where you could sit and enjoy this artwork for hours.",
          "This is definitely worth your time to see. Clearly attracts a crowd, and deservingly so. The history and the site are so important. Really glad that we took the time to find it.",
          "It was a nice break from he busy city to sit in the memorial for a few minutes in reflection. The carving is detailed and worth a visit even if just for a few minutes.",
          "The Lion Monument, also known as The Dying Lion of Lucerne, blew me away. It was absolutely awesome! It's a huge, beautifully carved lion into a massive rock wall.",
          "The area surrounding the garden is under construction so we weren\u2019t sure if there was normally some information provided about it on site but we\u2019d read about it previously and appreciated seeing it.",
          "You can't get up very close to the monument. Besides the pond that normally keeps you away, the entire area is being remodeled. A much needed remodeling of the park, WCs and the adjourning historical museum in underway when we were there in the fall of 2019. Worth walking by,",
          "When you read the history behind this sculpture it takes the already amazing visuals to a whole new level.",
          "This beautiful sculpture is carved out of a mountain side as a tribute to the almost 800 Swiss soldiers who perished in France while serving King Louis XIV. Of course, the King and Marie Antoinette also died at the guillotine. One of the soldiers who was on leave and therefore",
          "A short walk brings you to this beautiful monument. The carving is magnificent and the story well worth your time to read.",
          "This is within walking distance of the downtown area. There is a raised viewing area for a better look. Would recommend reading the story before visiting because everything carved in the monument has a meaning, but I'll put a synopsis here. Approximately 1000 Swiss guards",
          "Whether you care about the history or not, it's a very impressive caving and worth a short walk to go see. Lucerne isn't that big a city anyway, so you should be able to find time to check it out. It's a free attraction. Just walk up to the observation deck, fight your way past",
          "Lion Monument is walkable from city centre- else you can take Bus no 1, just few minutes ride after the promenade. Kind of hidden between the buildings, but it has a perfect viewing deck which allows you to click great pics! Few souvenir shops are around, even Casa grande which",
          "The Lion monument is one of the major tourist landmarks of Lucerne as well as Switzerland. Also known as the Dying Lion of Lucerne this carved out art is a must-do; when in Lucerne. It is symbolic of the heroism, duty and commitment of the Swiss guards who died protecting the",
          "This is a really beautiful memorial tucked away in a peaceful and tranquil part of Lucerne. It is really nice photo opportunity however it was very crowded when I arrived in the evening time.Be prepared for idiots pushing in for their selfie opportunities. I would suggest if u",
          "It\u2019s a huge lion carved out of a wall of a sandstone rock on a pond. It\u2019s in Lucerne. It was designed as a memorial for the mercenary soldiers from central Switzerland who lost their lives while serving the French king Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Worth going It is",
          "Perhaps I was expecting more. Very impressive work of art but ... definitely do it as it right in the town of Lucerne",
          "It's worth the walk to find this beautiful monument. The story behind it is very moving and the lion is so sad.",
          "I really liked seeing the Monument to the Swiss Guards, it is in a beautiful park behind the lake. I enjoyed why the monument was there and see if you can figure out the double meaning of the second animal that is visible. There were a few young people there smoking cannabis in",
          "Even though you will be surrounded by tourists, guides, and many snapping cameras, this is a very touching and beautiful art monument. It truly makes you pause and reflect upon the artist's ability to portray this devastating historical event. A meaningful experience..",
          "This monument is here to commemorate the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution. With the meaning behind it you just can't help but feel the emotions looking at the lion. Even without the meaning behind it, it is a moving monument that has been",
          "We visited this very moving monument twice while we were in Luzern. Because we knew the significance of the monument ( the Swiss guards massacred by the Parisian mob during the French Revolution) it greatly increased our appreciation. Unfortunately, the masses of tour groups",
          "Visiting Lucerne, the Lion Monument is a must see. It is a very impressive piece of art, & glad we checked it out. It\u2019s an easy walk from city centre.",
          "Relaxing visit to this beautiful monument in Lucerne.We went with a group of about 12 on a walking tour that included this stop. Worth seeing!",
          "I woke up early my last day in Lucern to scope out the Lion Monument. I figured if I had gotten up early enough I would have it all to myself to photograph. When I got to the park at 730am it was empty. The monument isn't that big but it's beautiful. It sits over a pond in a",
          "This massive monument that is off the beaten path in Lucerne is worth walk! It\u2019s much bigger than you\u2019d expect!",
          "This is a sculpture of dying lion honoring Swiss soldiers who died during the French Revolution. It is in a nice setting in what appears to be a small park. It is in the old town but not easy to find I came across it by seeing a tour group milling around the area.",
          "Interesting piece of art / history hidden close to the city center. Just a few minutes walk from Chapel Bridge and the waterfront. The park area is currently under construction but there is a temporary viewing platform for the monument.",
          "It is inspiring how the braves men of Lucerne die defending the silly king of France. the Swiss guards were told to stand down because the king was not in touch with reality and the mob slaughter them without mercy.",
          "Beautiful town with a very sad event in the past remembered by this monument to those who died in defense of their king",
          "Just a short walk from our hotel. In a lovely setting the sculpture has historical significance. Just a short visit to take pictures.",
          "We spent a day in Lucerne which was near the lake. Out the various attractions, we visited this 1. Pretty decent.",
          "So expressive of the defeat of the Swiss Guard that went to France to help defend the French monarchy during the French Revolution.",
          "We walked a short distance through Lucerne to get to view the monument. Monument is certainly impressive. We were there in shoulder season, so viewing the monument was easy.",
          "A must see! Not far from chapel bridge and a total beautiful serene place, the carving is fabulous detail stunning. Very moving place. A Must see",
          "This was near the top of my list to do in Lucerne, and it did not disappoint. While it\u2019s a little off the beaten path, it was still flooded with people and I can only imagine that was because it\u2019s incredibly poignant and majestic. I recommend stopping at a Migros or Coop on the",
          "This was worth a look. The sculpture was great and the setting was great too. good place for a photo op.",
          "Very close to old town yet an area of its own. Usually its quite busy here from what we've heard but it was very quiet when we visited in the evening. So serene has a small pond with the monument.",
          "You can't help but be moved by this sculpture carved into a hillside, above a pool. It's almost like a mausoleum for the huge, brave but now helpless, dying lion pierced by a broken spear. The lion represents 760 Swiss guards to the French King Louis 16 who were massacred in",
          "It is a memorial for those who sacrificed in France during French Revolution. A lion monument in front of a pond. Other than the historical background and the monument, there is really nothing much here. However, there were many tourist buses with groups and groups of Chinese",
          "An impressive monument, that is worthwhile mostly because of the underlying historical aspects. It is emblematic of Luzern. That being said, it is only a statue so do not book your whole afternoon just for that, especially as it is slightly distant from the other main points",
          "No words to describe what one feels as you go in to the area where the Lion Monument is. We went on a beautiful sunny morning. Amazing wok done by artist. The expression on the Lion's face is unreal. TIP: Nice souvenir store right outside of the Monument area. (Casa Grande)",
          "The Lion Monument, Lucerne, Switzerland; the dying lion was engraved on a rock. The lion represents the Swiss Guard, which was massacred while trying to protect Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Walking distance from Lucerne railway station and very close to Chapel bridge.",
          "This is a monument to Swiss guards killed defending the Royals during the French Revolution. But don't just see the monument, check out the park it is in. We recommend starting with this before tackling the Musegg Wall.",
          "You read about this and what a sight to behold!! The sleeping lion memorializes the Swedish mercenaries. Even on a rainy day it is stunning.",
          "Not sure it was worth all the effort as I walked pretty far out of the way but it is beautiful and there are things to see and do nearby",
          "So sad . Read the history before you take a walk to this poignant monument . There is a small park where you can take a pause and be thankful for the men who suffered for freedom.",
          "This is an impressive monument in a beautiful, quiet garden setting. It is located close to shopping and restaurants.",
          "A great rock carving that has interesting history. Nice pool in front to get reflective photos. Free to take photos.",
          "A highlight of Luzure, absolutely beautiful. A true work of art, don\u2019t miss it. Benches available to sit also restroom up the path",
          "The lion is nearly 200 years old and honors the Swiss Guard who died during the French Revolution. The location is in the middle of the city, but is easy to reach. It is a moving and almost emotional sculpture located in a peaceful setting. Some try to find another animal in",
          "I was deeply moved by this sculpture, the way the sculptor created such emotion on the body of this lion. Yes, it gets crowded with tour groups but they don\u2019t stay long. Take the time to sit in the rocks and just look. I stayed an hour. Mark Twain said \u201cthe Lion of Lucerne is",
          "Busy location with people, but an easy walk from the river and worth the effort once you understand the history.",
          "This exquisite sculpture was actually carved right into the marble itself. The lion represents and honors the Swiss mercenaries whose lives were lost. The lion's facial expression is so genuinely strong and suffering at the same time. It is a captivating sculpture you will",
          "A beautiful memorial carved in stone in 1820 in memory of the Swiss Guards that were killed during the French Revolution in Paris. It is one of Switzerland's most visited sites and is probably one of Lucerne's most famous tourist attractions. It is just a short outside of the",
          "This lion is a memorial to the members of the Swiss guard who died in battle in Paris. It\u2019s a lovely and moving tribute.",
          "The story behind this beautiful statute is worth listening to or reading about. And it's absolutely stunning to see it in person. I wouldn't miss it.",
          "Not a great deal to see. Nice monument carved into a cliff but that's about it. It was all over in 5 minutes.",
          "Great statue with really good detail. It\u2019s even better when you read up on why it was made. Really easy walk to get to it. I thought it was going to be a trek, but then looked it up on the maps and saw it was right in the city. All the pics look like it\u2019s out in the",
          "This monument is certainly worth a trip to check out. The perfectly etched stone is very moving, and the entire scene is both impressive and serene. A quick walk from old town as well.",
          "Easy to find. Can either walk or take public transportation to Lion Monument. Be sure to know the story behind the monument before arrival. Very emotional.",
          "A great monument to see, the lion with the spear in it. Our Travel Director told us an additional story..... The artist was told they would receive X amount of money for this work. When he unveiled it, he was given only half the money. He would not ruin his work, but, that",
          "We walked all the way from our hotel to see the famous Lion Monument. The monument itself was impressive. Unfortunately the pond in front of it had been drained on the day we visited, so it was disappointing on the day we visited. We weren\u2019t able to get the pictures we had",
          "The \u201cLion Monument\u201d is another landmark of Lucerne. It is a great work of art, impressive and emotional. It\u2019s worth to see it.",
          "Wonderfully done monument that really captures the emotion of the fallen soldiers. Look for the \"Pig\" but once you see it you will not be able to unsee it.",
          "This is worth a visit in Luzern and the pictures cannot capture the size and detail on this carving in the rock",
          "Lion monument is a wonderful photo scene it's beautifully designed we loved it. It's one of the most visited monument in Lucerne.",
          "Very emtional place. Beautiful site. We went there twice. Very peaceful. Great tribute to the soldiers who did not make it home.",
          "Beautiful setting and beautiful historical carving that represents the Swiss who died protecting the French. The lion is carved in sandstone and rests above a beautiful small pond surrounded by lush green area. A nice stop to relax or bring a lunch.",
          "This is a carving of a giant dying lion in a wall of sandstone rock above a pond at the east end of town. It was designed as a memorial for the mercenary soldiers from Switzerland who lost their lives while serving French king Louis XVI.",
          "Had seen pictures of this for years and was so excited when I finally was able to visit it in person. It is amazing!! The park area is smaller than I thought---but still.... just beautiful",
          "Out tour group visited this beautiful monument that honors the Swiss soldiers. It was very interesting and definately worthwhile visiting.",
          "It is a very sad monument to fallen Swiss soldiers in the 1700\u2019s but has more meaning once you learn about the story from the history museum. Visit here first and then come back and view the monument with a fresh perspective.",
          "Went to see the Lion Monument as part of a tour. Well worth the visit. Such a stunning piece of work in a beautiful and serene location.",
          "We visited the Lion Monument once again on our most recent visit to Lucerne. This is a \"must see\" experience when visiting the city. Unfortunately, it is often very crowded with tour groups and visitors. We always walk here from the old town. It is an easy walk but you must",
          "I am not sure I would make a special trip to see it, but if you are in the old town area, it is worth a visit. It won't take long to see and snap a few photos. Read the story behind it before you go... it makes it more meaningful.",
          "Everybody goes there because is in the old town. The story of this monum is funny as Swiss mercenaries died defending the idiot French king... You have to go, nice if you don't have big expectations.",
          "The Lion Monument is dedicated to fallen Swiss guardsmen who died during the French Revolution. It is carved out of stone on site and looks very moving. Said to be one of the busiest tourist spots in Lucerne. Worth one visit.",
          "Must see it in person to appreciate the detail and intricacy that was put into this monument. The meaning behind it is sad and beautiful what they did it for. There may some mosquitoes near it cause of standing water so beware. Other than that it can get crowded if there are",
          "The history of the Swiss mercenary soldiers, and their role in what Switzerland is today, is worth looking into. In addition to the specific story behind this memorial. Adjacent is a great museum and home of the gentleman who discovered the glaciated rock formations while simply",
          "Simple but moving. Recommend reading Mark Twain's description of this monument as it enriches the experience.",
          "This monument is carved into the side of large cliff. The setting is an unexpected oasis in the city. There was little signage about the reason for the monument but it is an impressive work of art. Bonus\u2014free restrooms!",
          "It was very crowded at the Monument when we visited on a late Sunday afternoon, but it was well worth the visit. It really isn't a bad walk from the City Center--no need to take public transportation. My only complaint was that many tourists stood right in front of the Lion,",
          "As the tour guide was telling the story of this great enchanting monument, I couldn\u2019t help not feeling overwhelmed by the beauty not only of what i was seeing but by the story behind it! Its a must see !!",
          "A must see, I guess but it's always too noisy, too crowded... Maybe try visiting on a rainy day? Interesting historical value though.",
          "We found it very moving but depressing. It is helpful if you know the reason for the sculpture beforehand because there is nothing there to explain it to you. We were there at 2pm on a Tuesday and there was only a dozen people there, amazing. You only need 5 minutes here. If you",
          "It's an interesting monument. If you don't have a tour guide you won't understand the full story and details behind it.",
          "It\u2019s a very nice place to visit, full of emotions! It was crowded but there are plenty of spots to take pics!",
          "A fantasic sculpture in a solid rock cliff face. The adjacent glacier museum is fantastic, as is the bizarre house of mirrors in the museum garden. Sounds lame but don't miss it. The area in front of the lion monument can be PACKED with insanely noisy tour groups, so try to",
          "Go! Go! Go! definitely worth trip. I know you think what can be so exciting about a lion Monument. The detail and the questions about which way he is looking. Which way he is about to pounce. The gardens. The area around that you must see. Just GO!",
          "it is a beautiful monument carved into the wall with a pool of water in front. simple, beautiful, powerful.",
          "Visited the statue and was amazed of the craftsmanship and eye for detail which was put in the carving. Sorry to see that there was no sign or marker to tell the story behind it. (Of if it was there it was not obvious to find it)",
          "If you find the right time without huge tourist groups (maybe when it's not the best weather) then this is a nice place visit. With a stroller I wouldn't go there on a nice weekend. The tourists don't leave you any space and don't even realise that they block the whole way with",
          "This monument to Swiss mercenary soldiers was carved into the sandstone rock wall in the early 1800's. The detail by the artist is spectacular and is definitely worth visiting while in Lucerne. It's background story is tragic, but very interesting. Take a few minutes to read",
          "Every tourist group was here when we visited. The lion monument was different. Would I advise visitors to go there, probably not.",
          "Beautiful statue and great history. Story behind the carving is very tragic. The French soldiers fought a valiant fight.",
          "A very worthwhile short walk from the river to see this sculpture. The expression on the face of the lion is incredibly sad.",
          "This is one of those don't-miss spots in Luzern, just a short walk up from the lake. Whoever was on the right or wrong side of history, the Lion is also one of the most moving pieces of memorial sculpture you will see. He is a tribute to the 1,000 Swiss Guards - then working",
          "You don't need to spend long here - but the history is so interesting (& sad) & it really is remarkably beautiful. We were doing a European tour, so were able to explain the link between the Swiss Guard at the Vatican, as well as the relevance of the Tuileries in Paris to this",
          "Fascinating to see the crying lion carved into the stone. A wonderful memorial to the fallen soldiers.",
          "Not overly large or artistically stunning it is a must see because of the back story. A lone surviving Swiss Guardsman created this tribute to his fallen comrades. Easy to get to, free and has public free WCs(toilets)",
          "Come early in the morning or in the evening for a quiet moment to remember those fallen so long ago.",
          "The lion monument in certainly grand and worthy of a picture. I doubt though many people are aware of its significance - a monument to Swiss Guard killed during the French revolution. It looks as though it is guarding the lake in front of it. Make sure to stop off if visiting",
          "This monument doesn't have as much of an impact without a qualified tour guide to explain it to visitors. Yes, independent visitors will find plaques to explain what this monument commemorates, but a tour guide who knows the history of Switzerland and the Swiss Guard will be",
          "This monument is very striking and sad to look at. I am glad I visited. Easy to get to even for handicap.",
          "I was not very keen on visiting the place due to unimpressive reviews. But, the place changed my mind. Go for the history. It\u2019s awesome.",
          "The lion is very impressive monument, but many tourists seem to know nothing about its history. They take pictures and selfies, as if it was just a Disney lion. How stupid!",
          "It is a sad lion and the sculpture has never been finished (edges) because the sculptor has not need paid enough. It is beautiful and it definitely worth visiting",
          "Pretty interesting landmark with very fine scupture work . Good photo op in a lively part of Lucerne .",
          "Wait for the tour groups to pass and find the bench on the hill and enjoy this wonderful sculpture. Also a good restroom break!",
          "It is an easy walk and free from anywhere in Lucerne. Beautifully done and a must to see..It is dedicated to the 800 Swiss mercenaries that were killed in the French Revolution.",
          "Lion monument was great to see, very busy place, lots of tourist, get to see it early then head to the museum by the lion.",
          "Before you go to visit the Lions you would be well off to research its history. We were fortunate to have a tour guide who gave us the backstory and that made this monument all the more impressive. It is simple yet the face of the lion is profoundly moving. Worth the stop on a",
          "This is a monument to Swiss solders that died in a battle. It is very peaceful, even with a minimum one coach load of people there all the time. The lion is beautifully carved and it under it is a list of the dead The pond and gardens are very pretty.",
          "This is a must see. The history of the monument is so cool. Enjoyed my visit there. Highly recommend !",
          "The pictures don't do this monument justice. It must be seen. Beautiful. Easy five or so minute walk the beginning of Old Town.",
          "Lion Monument (or L\u00f6wendenkmal, in German) is a very big statue (twice the real measure) obviously of a Lion, which is located in Lucerne, a city in Switzerland. It is located close to Gletschergarten and Bourbaki Panorama, so if you comr the city, a visit of these three points",
          "We found nothing too gr8 about d place. It was quite and peaceful but nothing so special to visit. Just spent 10-15 mins.",
          "A monument of much significance to the Swiss but also a sculpture of great beauty. Very moving. Take a walk to this end of town and spend a few minutes contemplating what it represents and appreciating the artistry.",
          "A must see. This monument is beautifully sculpted and brings a tear to the eye when you know it's history.",
          "This was one of my favorite spots in all of our trip to Switzerland. Words don't speak well enough for this monument. It was stunning and sad. I'll never forget it.",
          "A moving monument to the Swiss soldiers who were killed in France during the French Revolution. Try to visit it when not too busy.",
          "A stunning sculpture in a pretty park. Lots of shade to relax if you want to. The public WC is \"interesting\". The little water spout to the left of the Lion gives lovely chilly water from underground. OK to drink or just wash your hands with.",
          "We were But tight on time but none the less visited this attraction, though briefly. It is in a tricky part of town to drive to and best to leave your car away and walk a bit. The monument itself is worth a visit and try and grasp a bit about that history to make the trip",
          "This beautiful stone carving is truly breathtaking, especially when you pay particular attention to the numerous and intricate details the sculptor has deftly included. It is especially moving when you're aware of the backstory, the massacre of the Swiss Guards during the",
          "The monument is pretty good and the gardens are nice, but it's not somewhere you need to spend a lot of time. It's around 10 minutes walk from the centre of Lucerne.",
          "I usually find monuments like this a little underwhelming but this one was surprisingly good. I\u2019m glad I visited it! The Lion Monument, a powerful memorial, pays homage to the selfless heroes of the Swiss Guard. On 10 August 1792, 1,000 of them were killed by revolutionaries",
          "This lion is just awesome. Great to see in daylight and is subtly lit for night. Easy walk from the station.",
          "This is in Lucerne. The wounded lion is a symbol of courage & valor of the soldiers. It's a tribute to them. There is no entrance fee to see it. A must see place in Lucerne. Its a beautiful piece of sculpture.",
          "Very interesting relief carving of a lion but was a bit underwhelmed after reading about it and hearing from other who had been there. It is said to be the equivalent of Mount Rushmore but I would say it doesn't come close.",
          "Our guide had explained the monument prior to visit and we were expecting Mt. Rushmore size and got something much less. However it was interesting even though it seemed a bit out of place in the town. History was the most interesting part.",
          "A must do. Saw the sad lion.Nicely engraved on the wall its easily walkable from the main square. You pass some superb shopping windows..",
          "A stunning carving in the rock wall. It's very impressive and represents a part of Swiss history. Just make sure you go early if possible to avoid any tour groups. It's free to visit as well.",
          "Very easy to walk here. This was a quick stop to snap some pics and continue on our way. We went early morning to avoid crowds and it was empty",
          "It's a beautiful place with the lion sculpture, but the lake could be better cared. The history behind the monument is very important, since the lion represents the Swiss soldiers that were dead in French revolution.",
          "The monument itself is very nice, depicting an important part of history but the place is crowded as heck. I don\u2019t understand why people have to pose in front of this for mutiple pictures making the viewing experience a nightmare.",
          "The lion monument is carved directly into the cliff. The lion is wounded to represent all the soldiers that were killed. It\u2019s a nice spot to take some pictures with the lion reflecting into the water. If you\u2019re in the area, it\u2019s worth a short visit.",
          "Of course a must visit place in Lucerne. It's beautiful & makes you feel connected to the place because of it's history. Try going early morning or late evening to avoid crowd. It's a great place to enjoy sunset too.",
          "This is a quick stop to take in a little history of Lucerne's independence. This is carved from a solid piece of sandstone directly into the cliff. It commemorates the cities independence and a must see fountain. Easy to access walking or city bus.",
          "The regal feline's pose, curled into his stone den and his reflection in the pond below make the sculpture a masterpiece",
          "I was in Luzern to attend the Roger Hodgson concert but also had time for a bit of sightseeing. This monument by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen was right around the corner from my hotel so, being Danish, I thought I would have a look. I was met by a crowd of tourists making",
          "This is a monument to Swiss soldiers who were killed protecting the French king during French Revolution.it is out of single rock and uniquely designed",
          "We visited while we were on a walking tour of Lucerne. The monument is a dedication to the brave soldiers of Switzerland.",
          "The most amazing carving out of the cliff face. A marvel of emotion in a piece of sculpture. A work of art to behold. A heartfelt tribute to so many who tragically lost their lives so long ago. It was an honour to absorb the immensity of the work, & the history. Photos don\u2019t do",
          "The Lion Monument is a massive carving of a dying lion in sandstone rock above a pond. This memorial was designed in to honour the Swiss troops who tried to defend the royal family of King Louis XVI during the French Revolution and who helped the royal family to escape. The",
          "This monument commemorates a sad event and does so with artistic style and grace. A must see stop in Lucerne.",
          "It\u2019s my second time in Lucerne and also my second time visiting this monument after around 30 years. I still find the monument and the vicinity beautiful. There are seats there and if you have time, you should take a seat and just enjoy the moment and take it all in - the",
          "Glad we went, does not take a lot of time and no charge. Take #1 bus from train station. Three stops, the name of the stop is Lion Monument. Leaving the bus walk left 45 degrees up the hill. It is in a park. Had a very good pizza at Caravelle just below the park.",
          "I'm not sure if it was worth spending 30 mins to get to this place as we only spent about 10 mins at the monument. There is nothing really to do here other than just look at the wall with the lion on it. As we had nothing to do, we went to the glacier museum right next to it and",
          "It is not too far from town center and certainly different from most monuments you may see. It is larger than you might expect before visiting. A guide will point out its significance.Created to honor Swiss Guards killed in 1792 during the French Revolution.It's very well done.",
          "Lovely area and tribute monument to Switzerland from France. It\u2019s in a beautiful small garden in a good cafe and shopping area. It can get very crowded with tourists but nice to see",
          "This monument has been made( monolithic) to celebrate the bravery of soldiers who guarded the French king during French Revolution ...the sculptor supposed to have been not paid in full ... in protest he made a small pig outline behind the lion..,visible only if you watch keenly.",
          "It was so crowded when we went, I really couldn't enjoy the monument. I'm suggesting you go early or late to avoid the crowds. I would probably increase my rating if I had an opportunity to return during a less crowded time.",
          "Truly a moving monument, the lions expression says it all. Heart breaking, It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, monument that expresses the pain and suffering the occurred to the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during",
          "My wife and I enjoyed our visit here, and took some nice pictures. Taking some time to understand why this sculpture was made and what the scene represents helped us enjoy this very sad but moving piece of art. The location is very peaceful, and I would recommend a visit, not",
          "This is a monument to fallen soldiers and looking at the lion just makes you feel the anguish the city felt for their men who died. It is a short worthwhile walk to see. Hint: look for the pig and then look up the story.",
          "A very beautiful stone carving. Read the history before you visit. If you visit Lucerne, this is must. And there is no cost to visit.",
          "A short 10 minute walk from the old city, the lion monument is a hidden oasis that is well worth visiting. Not taking long, or taking as long as you want, it is incredible to see the carving in the wall, above the lake that was completed in 1792. Why not pay your tributes to",
          "This lion sculpture is beautifully done and well worth a visit. Understanding the story behind it will make the experience much more worthwhile. It is a monument to the Swiss Guards who laid down their lives in the service of King Louis XIV of France.",
          "I can\u2019t comprehend why this is a popular sight to visit. This is a lion carved out of stone on the side of a rock face.",
          "The Lion Monument is one of those places that has to be experienced in person to truly be appreciated. Prior to visiting I had no expectation of how it would make me feel. A powerful monument.",
          "Beautiful and very moving monument which is well worth seeing on a trip to Lucerne. Sadly like just about everything else in the city it is being ruined by tour groups with selfie sticks. We were lucky that there were only a few people when we visited but we then went to the bar",
          "This sculpture of a wounded lion is, as many have said, a nice piece of art. The immediate area is undergoing some renovation which doesn\u2019t impede the view. Although most tours make this a \u201cmust see\u201d stop, it\u2019s worth a few minutes if you\u2019re doing the Lucern Old Town walking",
          "The sculpture of the dying lion on the rock face stirs one with a tinge of sadness. The entry is free and there is a beautiful landscape around it. There are two other tourist spots, the Glacier Garden and the Bourbaki Panorama close by along with some souvenir shops. It\u2019s a",
          "We were on a walking tour of Lucerne were we stopped by this site just an ordinary point with a crying Lion sculpted in the wall but I guess architecture/ history lovers would appreciate",
          "A short walk from the centre of town, and at least worthy of a visit. It is a great piece of art rather than just a sculpture, but somethings not appreciated by those around.",
          "Really cool statue carved out of the mountain. It gets pretty busy in the small park, but it\u2019s certainly worth the visit.",
          "We took the train to Lucerne to see the Chapel Bridge, the old City and this monument. It's breathtaking. And a quick walk from the train Depot.",
          "Now, in contrast to the city centre, this place is full of tourists so be sure to get their early. There will most likely be a ton of asian tourists using selfie sticks to take photos and people will be bumping into you. Bring comfortable walking shoes. It's a really cool",
          "This monument is nestled between buildings and is an easy walk from the waterfront. You would need to know the history of this monument to understand the significance of it. Our tour guide explained it to us.",
          "The lion monument is an iconic monument of Lucerne and a must visit. They also have a museum which is free if you have a Swiss pass like most museums in Switzerland. The beginning part of the museum is preserved parts of the glaciers that used to be present there in the ice age",
          "People who come in buses are only bought here it seems as one come across bus after bus of tourists visiting this place to have picture clicked with the monument. This was built in memory of soldiers killed in WW.",
          "Make sure you read up on the history behind prior to your visit, otherwise you'll have wasted your time. The sculpture is all there is to the monument, nothing much. It is a short walk from the piers at the lake. You will need maybe 15 minutes to take photos and have a look.",
          "That is the translation of the \u2018HELVETIORUM FIDEI AC VIRTUTI\u2019 inscription engraved above the grotto. The head of a spear sticking out from the side of the lion is the cause of its suffering and its eventual death. It may go unnoticed at first glance. Interpreted differently",
          "The Lion of Lucerne is an important part of visiting the city. It\u2019s actually quite impressive, with the lion\u2019s sad tears bemoaning the death of 752 Swiss soldiers in 1792 as in fact the lion dies from a stab wound. There are many layers of symbolism. When you visit, pray that",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful carving in stone...Lucerne isn\u2019t a big place so not too far a walk for most but it is all that is there other than a souvenir shop.",
          "Read the story behind the sculpture. It is interesting. Then when you arrive, try to contemplate what the artist was trying to achieve. Take a pic and move on. Nothing else much to see or do there. I highly recommend going early and taking a pic by yourself. Otherwise, it is a",
          "It's a status of a crying lion.. It's not really worth going out of the way to see. Unless you are particularly interested in that period in history.. Even then.",
          "The lion monument is one of the most famous spots to visit in Lucerne and I was not one to miss the same. The Lion monument is engraving done on the rock commemorating the Swiss Guards who died during the French Revolution protecting the Royal family.. The spot is in old part",
          "My wife and I were recently on a Tour of Austria and Switzerland and had a tour of The Lion Monument. Our Tour Director Lucy gave us the fascinating story behind the mon-ument and the details that led up to its creation. While we were there, the area became extremely congested.",
          "This is a quick visit but I would say a must see. Very impressive carving into the side of the cliff. Much larger than we thought it would be. An easy walk from town.",
          "Celebrating an ancient war end, this monument in the old town is carved directly on a large rock formation, behind a small pond.",
          "You don\u2019t need to be here long, but it\u2019s part of the history of Luzern, so worth the short walk from the centre of town.",
          "We went in the dark so it wasnt crowded but you could get a good view even then. Water in front of it so dont fall in. Lion carved in the wall.",
          "Another reminder to me of our trip to Lucerne, I was touched by the story of this very well done art carving. For some reason, probably the French Revolution, I think about the classic \"Tale of Two Cities\" whenever I think about this Art. If you visit Lucerne, you must stop for",
          "This was the farthest location on our walking excursion and the sites there and back are for sure worthwhile. Not sure I would have made the trip just for this monument but worth it if you are nearby. Pretty crowded on a nice day as well so hard to get a good pic.",
          "Very impressive carving in a rock and the meaning of it , it takes two seconds to Visit and is totally worth it, many shops and restaurants along the area.",
          "This is a must see in Lucerne and is well worth the walk. the statue is beautifully done and very moving.",
          "Very strange monument and even I read the mening of it I dont understand it. It is nice doen and a new place.",
          "The nicest thing about the monument is that it is a close walk from the lake promenade so you can go and quickl look at it. Its nice and surrounded by a lake, but nothing spectaculour.",
          "I went after 8 years and still feel an attachment of unknown reasons . The weather was awesome and beauty of this art work is unpaealleled",
          "Lion Monument is located in Lucerne city. This attraction has a bit of history associated with it. Lion stands in honour of a Swiss soldier who defended French king during French Revolution. This lion lays in pain after being hit by an arrow. The pain can be visibly seen on",
          "Lucern is so easy to walk around and everything is close to the main downtown area. Check out the Lion Monument because it has a good story and is quite pretty. Then, go into the glacier museum that's right there.",
          "Lion monument is worth the visit if in Luzern, but it pays to be aware of what the monument is about",
          "It was bigger than I thought. Great detail and showed so much emotion just from a rock carving. Went in the evening, not crowded.",
          "We saw this on a walking tour with Viking and it was very pretty. The carving is beautiful and much larger than it appears",
          "Worth the visit! This lion stands in honor of the Swiss guard that defended the French King during the French Revolution. Hurt by an arrow, the lion lays in pain... the work of the statue is excellent. The pain in the lion\u2019s face is evident. The choice of a lion to represent the",
          "Worth taking a walk by and some pictures but not a lot to do other than that. It is a beautiful carved monument and a landmark.",
          "The photos don't do this justice. It means more when you read up about it so you recognise the symbology of the details and appreciate the history behind it. The lion looks magnificent. The city should do more to spruce it up to make it worthy",
          "This monument is so well done that you feel like crying just to see the pain on this lions face. Of course it is in honor of the Swiss Guard who have lost their life in the call of duty. But the artist has done an amazing job on this monument. Seeing this work of art will stay",
          "A somber moment experienced by all in the group, an incredible feat of work carved into stone, to be viewed by day and night for contrast - the heart felt story of the Swiss fallen soldiers that gave them their lives staying loyal to French King, that cost this country a great",
          "This statue of a huge dead lion is a military monument to 700 Swiss soldiers who gave their lives fighting for France. Most people do not notice the rock frame around the statue which appears as an outline of a pig.",
          "If you visit luzerne and have a time , worth visiting, not much to spend rather to take some pictures",
          "When you are in Luzern, be sure to walk over to see this monument carved into the granite. It\u2019s very moving and huge. I\u2019d recommend you read about it first. I always make a stop here to sit and ponder on my trips to Luzern. Plan to stay at least 15 minutes or more and that way",
          "It is a sad story and well worth visiting. It is an easy bus ride from old town and the Glacial Garden is right there.",
          "The little park is attractive and the carving is a quite moving tribute to brave soldiers and their sacrifice. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "This lion monument was carved out of solid rock to memorialize the Swiss Guard troops that were killed while protecting the French monarchy. My wife and I found this monument to be one of the most moving places we have ever visited. The stone carving work is outstanding, and",
          "Definitely worth a stop while in town. Nice large carving into the stone with pool of water below, nice peaceful setting",
          "It is a beautiful carving of stone and what it represents. Almost hard to believe it is made of stone.",
          "We hadn\u2019t seen the Lion Monument since 2007, our first time. My wife and I enjoyed this visit and its surroundings since we weren\u2019t on a group tour this time. It\u2019s history is always worth learning again and I would recommend it to everyone visiting Lucerne the first time.",
          "The lion Monument is amazing and the story is interesting as well. Worth the hike off the main sections to see it but I would not recommend the glacier museum. Save your time and money unless you have a lot of both.",
          "This place is within walking distance from Chapel Bridge. The monument is to commemorate the fighting of Swiss Guard to protect King of France in French Revolution. It's free and worth for taking photos.",
          "The Dying Lion monument is definitely worth seeing when in Lucerne. It is beautifully carved and his mane, nose and tooth are particularly detailed. It is set behind a lake so you can only view from a distance, but its impact is great - the symbolism is very moving. This is a",
          "Must-see place in Lucern. Dying lion monument is really impressive. It is hidden in the garden in the center of Lucern.",
          "This monument is a spectacular and poignant. I've never seen a monument carved into a cliff/rock face before, and it was particularly moving. It is also a well shaded spot, and nice for a little rest.",
          "This seemed like a nice monument until the story with the connection of this town to the French Revolution. Then this place became sombre and sad. Well worth seeing and hearing the story.",
          "We\u2019ve been sightseeing Luzern and the Lion was on the map. Yes, it\u2019s huge. But not something you shouldn\u2019t miss. Yes, M. Twain said... Well, maybe only if you understand the meaning of the monument. I rather appreciate the artistic value. Which didn\u2019t impress me.",
          "Despite the many reviews read prior to our visit, we were glad we did take time to visit this monument. The sculpture was beautifully carved & rather moving especially looking into the details (broken spearhead, suppressed shield). Very symbolic indeed. The Glacier Garden is",
          "We heard of the monument from several people we met at our hotel and some of our guides. We are so glad we took the time to go see it. The monument is just beautiful and upon hearing the history behind we just stood in awe of the loyalty and dedication of the Swiss Guards.",
          "A very short and enjoyable walk from old city. It is an amazing monument carved out of stone with a reflecting pool below it. Places to sit to be contemplative.",
          "The lion Monument is ideally located in the Lucerne city. The place is very very peaceful and beautiful. The Lion Monument is related to Switzerland history. The dying Lion is carved on stone. The small pond and lush green environment enrich the atmosphere there at. There is a",
          "Free, easy to walk to (though yes, there are some stairs), but it was really so peaceful, artistic and a proud memorial to those who served.",
          "Connected to Switzerland history this beautiful lion carved in stone is a place that has to be included in a visit to Luzern. It is somewhat a hidden gem in town. If you go a bit early you may avoid the crowds and enjoy some nice time observing it",
          "In the very centre of Luzern, alongside an Alpine garden you will find this monument of the dying lion resting on a shield marked with French lilies. Overlooking small pond, carved in a rock, the size of a lion is colossal, but the whole site emanates subtle sorrow and peace.",
          "The Lion Monument is a landmark in Lucerne and is close to the city centre. It looks sad and probable longing for the open African savannah !",
          "This monument is a must see in Lucerne, it is beautiful, and moving, the expression on the lion's face tells a story, I sat for quite a while in contemplation. The outline of a pig on the wall surrounding the lion just makes it even more fascinating.",
          "It\u2019s a monument in view of respect to the soldiers. It was five minutes walk from our hotel. It\u2019s one of a kind. No tickets required.",
          "we had a great time there. the place was quiet and yet interesting to view. nice view of course, very special.",
          "I've visited the Lion Monument a number of times, at least three in tour groups. Only once did our guide take the time to help us Americans try and understand its significance. I'm unsure if was just her words or the tears that moved us more. I certainly recommend visiting",
          "By the time we reached the spot of Lion monument , the weather became bad. Sky cloudy with little intermittent drizzle. It was an interesting monument , lots of tourist visiting. A must see in Lucerne visit.",
          "This carving in the rock is really large, and well done. In front of it is a lovely pond, and has a lot of benches to sit and take it all in, and relax for a few minutes. And a big plus, free washrooms adjacent to the pond!",
          "First time to see a Lion sitting with a very sad face hahahahaha, but still place is nice to have some clicks.",
          "This is a nice sculpture of a lion in a rock. It was a stop on our tour of Lucerne. Nice for a picture but not much else to do here. A visit will take less than 15 minutes.",
          "Every time I come to Lucerne I like to visit here. I took my family here recently and we also went to the museum with the hall if mirrors. So fun!",
          "The Lion monument is of historical significance. Other than this, it is quite average and overrated.",
          "This place is completely overrated. We visited this place since it was at a walking distance from our hotel. The place is mostly visited by a lot of group tourist who are told this as a monumental sight seeing spot in old Lucerne. Rest of the Lucerne is extremely beautiful but",
          "A very sad monument in Lucerne, imbued with the tragedy of historical events. The sculpture is very huge in reality.",
          "The lion monument was far more impressive in person than expected. We loved seeing it. Must-see attraction!",
          "This monument signifies the loyalty and bravery of Swiss soldiers to their employee king of France LOUIS XVI. At first glance you can see a lion that is dying. You can notice head of the spear is sticking out from the side of the lion which signifies cause of its suffering and",
          "A must to see, a tribute to honor, bravery, loyalty and courage of the Swiss people. The glacier park is right next door.",
          "Easy to find and reach the Lion Monument from Lucerne Old Town. Its about 10-15 mins walk. Its free of charge. Good to go during the day. Nice place to take pictures and relax. Its quiet and peaceful. A lot of tourists come to this place. There are other tourists attractions",
          "Great for photog buffs or history buffs. Amazing detail and plenty of other things to see and do nearby.",
          "Just looking at him so perfect carved he looks so lonely, beautiful reflections in the pool below. Don\u2019t miss the glacier garden next to the statue with the hall of mirrors",
          "Hidden almost in a suburb this is a beautifully carved memorial to those Swiss who fell in the war as mercenaries for the French.",
          "The sleeping lion carved into the rock was pretty impressive. We ventured into the glacier exhibition which was really interesting as it showed how the rocks had formed over time and the effects of the glacier melting. Work is still being done to cut a walkway through the rocks.",
          "This is a true work of art that captures your heart from the moment you see it. We visited in December when it was easy to see and photograph but I would arrive early if visiting in the spring or summer.",
          "Majestic. Such a sad picture to look at. The detail is amazing. Easy to find and free to experience.",
          "A beautiful tribute to Swiss soldiers, this monument is a must see during any visit to Lucerne. It\u2019s beautifully carved, and it really makes you think. There is no charge to see the monument.",
          "Tucked away in an unassuming corner patch of Lucerne, this lion is so poignant and a real must see. Take a moment to stand and stare before grabbing a delicious coffee and cake in a nearby caf\u00e9.",

          "Initially was left worried that I may be left underwhelmed but how wrong I was! There is a quiet beauty in this sculpture and having read the history behind it, it left me moved. I'm glad I visited it.",
          "Amazing carving on the wall !! Big sculpture with a history! Small little venue with WC access. Nothing much around. Walking distance to Train station",
          "A visit to Lucerne would not be complete without paying a visit to the commemorative monument delegated to the some 300 fallen Swiss Guards during the French Revolutions who gave their lives defending Louis the 16th. There is a small pond or lake in front of the monument and",
          "Try to view the lovely Lion Monument which is a moving and memorable tribute to the fallen courageous Swiss guards, who lost their lives defending Louise XVI in 1792, during the French Revolution. It is hewn from rock, and carved into the cliff face of a former sandstone quarry",
          "Easy to find this place. There are few benches around, nice to have a pit stop with coffee and enjoy the monument. If you love history and museum, take time to explore the glacier park and surrounding museum. It can be pretty slippery on a rainy day.",

          "The ride up is cool, especially on days with good visibility. Up top is cool. The snow play / sledding area isn\u2019t always open - depends on the weather. Can\u2019t get everyone everywhere (no grandma to the icy snowy summit) but almost \u2026",
          "Spectacular sculpture carved into the rock wall.  Under construction until Jan, 2020.  You can still see it but can't get too close at this time.",
          "Very good walked to visit and give you good atmosphere",
          "Very quick stop in Interlaken if you have some spare time.. and a public transport pass",
          "Nice lion. Pretty big. Lots of construction going on around it.",
          "Beautiful. Well worth a walk over.",
          "At Walkable distance from centre station. Yes, a monument it is, so expect it to be like in picture.",
          "Was there in early morning. No one was there except just us (family). It was a different feeling in front of it. Beautiful. Just near the wooden Chapel bridge. Must see.",
          "Impressive monument. You should visit it.",
          "Good location for visit, amazing work on rock..",
          "Gorgeous statue that has rich and interesting historical background !",
          "Very beautiful monument. They\u2019re currently (October 2019) doing construction in the area, but still enjoyed visiting.",
          "The Lion was vividly made. Very good a place.",
          "It's a good looking lion, beautifully sculpted, but not as spectacular as I'd hoped.",
          "Saddly they are working in that place so you cannot enjoy it properly. However even for that is Switzerland = Amazing",
          "I visited here 24 years ago as a student. It's a great memory.  This month, I visit here again.",
          "A quick tourist spot worthy of checking out.",
          "It's bigger than we expected and has some very nice historical context.",
          "This is an impressive sculture, one of the most visited monuments in Switzerland. It's a must see while visiting Luzern - the surroundings are also amazing.",
          "One of the most visited spots in Engelbert, Swiss.  Good tourism place.",
          "I've enjoyed going to it twice now, but it's not something I can imagine spending a whole lot of time at. You'll likely be on your way in no time, unless of course a tourist bus has just let off, then it's packed. Either way, you'll manage to get a quick picture before moving on.",
          "Its a very nice place... Nothing much to see though..But the sculpture is beautiful along with the story behind. If you look around you will find your self with restaurant's and Shops.",
          "Cool piece of history. I hope the tourists don't destroy it.",
          "Kind of a tourist trap.  Monument itself is beautiful but I feel many people come here just to snap a picture and leave, saying they have visited it.  For a good view go early in the morning or later at night.  Otherwise swarms of tourists from busses will block your view.",
          "Beautiful sculpture, but the viewing area is under construction",
          "The carving is beautiful. It makes more sense if u know the history",
          "Lots of tourists around. A lot of them arent respectful of the place. It should be a quiet and peaceful place but with the amount of people visiting. It lost that feeling.",
          "The lion monument in Luzern was a tribute to Swiss soldiers lost in various wars.  It seemed we walked a long way through the city to see it and renovations were underway, so we couldn't observe it from the usual platform.  A beautiful area, but not a must see while in Luzern.",
          "Stunningly beautiful sculpture, worth a visit. Can sit alongside benches in the shade of trees and be peaceful and contemplative of the work.",
          "Beautiful experience but be sure to arrive early to escape the crowds",

          "Lucerne was one of our favourite places to visit in Europe. The Lion Monument is worth checking out and ticking off this list. Great history.",
          "A beautiful piece of art in a serene setting. Be sure to read up on the history before your visit so you feel the full impact of what the piece is expressing.",
          "This is a beautiful monument with a beautiful meaning.",
          "Very crowded - we did visit on a Saturday. We did not feel that the Choir of extinct animals really matched the history of the monument. However, the craftsmanship of this stone sculpture really does take your breath away.",
          "Really just a statue of a lion in a rock.  Place was under construction when I was there.  Wasn't able to get close enough to really appreciate anything.  A little disappointed.",
          "Although the people\u2019s comments are not that good, it\u2019s really impressing to see the lion.  Can feel the gravity and the atmosphere here is solemn and respectful.  Can\u2019t help but stare at this sculpture again and again.",
          "Very nice free and big sized monument of a carved lion made out of stone dedicated to war heroes. The place can get crowded depending on his arrivals. There are also hidden speakers with nature sound of birds.",

          "Nice to this Lion Monument in commemoration of Swiss Guards. Don't forget to see this place.",
          "It's a good sculpture carved in the mountain, but not a big loss if you don't have time to visit this place. I would recommend a cruise and a walk in the main market for window shopping over this.",
          "Beautiful art of a lion carved into the rock. Nice place to see and take a couple of pictures there. \nGet there through L\u00f6wenplatz. \nEnjoy!",
          "Great spot, better than the bridge that is overhyped",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in Lucerne. Wonderfully calm and serene if you visit in the night. Full of tourists if you visit in the day but still great to see.",
          "Lion monument is located at Denkmalstrasse 4, 6002 Luzern, Switzerland. It is the monument of a dying lion carved in a rock face in 1972 and dedicated to Tuileries war hero. This place is one of the famous tourist locations in Switzerland.",

          "Not as big as expected. Great statue with historical significance. But too famous with always crowded tourists.",
          "An interesting piece of Swiss war history. Go early or late to beat the tour group crowds. Has wonderful public restrooms. Hats off to the Swiss, there is no world parallel for facilities and cleanliness!",

          "Beautiful. A lot of work went into chiseling to piece.",

          "This great stone carving of a dying lion .. carved out of a huge rock cliff, is a monument to ~760 Swiss soldiers who died in French revolution! It's beautiful and quite majestic .. has pond in the front, and is located in nice park, in Lucerne, Switzerland \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Love this place. It's easy to find and you can walk there.",
          "I think where a peace pact was brokered or a decision to protect the sovereignty of Zurich was made... one of it. But hey, the art in itself is magnificent.  You surely must pay a visit here if you find yourself in switzerland.. lovely environment with water just by the lion.. rooooaaaaar...",
          "A great piece of art. Has a lot of value locally. A good spot for small time visits.",
          "Just a place with the lion monument and not much information in English. When I went, the site is under construction and we can only see the Lion from a temporary platform. Just a snap of photo and can go.",

          "Interesting monument. Very similar one is on Predel pass/Passo di Predil between Slovenia and Italy.",
          "The place is very cool. It is just 3 stops for main Lucerne stop . Lots of busses goes to here like 1, 22,19. Nothing much except the wounded lion. But the sculpture is very very artistic. The carving on the stone is just awesome",
          "Whether you care about the history or not, it's a very impressive caving and worth a short walk to go see. Lucerne isn't that big a city anyway, so you should be able to find time to check it out. It's a free attraction. Just walk up to the \u2026",
          "Nice memorial to the fallen soldiers. The site has more of a somber vibe. Felt better just admiring the monument than trying to take a photo with it like many of the others were doing.",
          "Nice place.... Would have liked to say quiet but lots of people visit ... You can definitely spend sometime here... Aboit \u00e0 Kilometer from Lucerne Railway station. You can walk or take the bus... The sculpture is nice (and sad). Is worth a visit when you have time on your hands.",
          "The lion actually tugs at your heart. Made me a little sad the way the gorgeous creature lay there.",
          "Closed off to where you're not able to stand near the waters edge as seen on many YouTube vlogs. The platform where they allow people to view stays crowded at times.",
          "The monument is in Lucerne Switzerland. It depicts loyalty and bravery of the Swiss guards during French Revolution. It has historic importance. It is a 6 by 10 meter sculpture. Its beautiful and well maintained for tourists. There is a toy \u2026",

          "Fun & free to visit. If you would like to see the glacier, they recommend going there in the early AM. There was a group of Indian tourists with one man dancing \u00e0 la bollywood style to keep warm. I think he entertained everyone else who was visiting. :)",

          "Jun 19: A place to experience the history of road-, rail, water- and air-borne mobility, as well as that of space travel. Buy the combo ticket - to the museum as well as to the Chocolate adventure. The museum is huge and one will need at a minimum 2-3 hours to go through this",
          "Jun 19: Once done with the museum, take the Chocolate adventure. They made the journey from the cocoa to the chocolate as an amazing journey telling about the relevant things. It will take less than 30 mins but an experience for sure. They take you around in a cup-saucer like",
          "While in Lucerne, don\u2019t wait for a rainy day to go and visit this fantastic place! Trains, boats, cars, planes and Space, you\u2019ve got it all! Try to spend at least 3 h to enjoy almost everything!",
          "Being a resident of Luzern, I personally feel if one has time (atleast a whole day) spend it at the Traffic museum...especially if you are traveling with kids, it\u2019s a great place. Tons to see, loads to do, and ofcourse don\u2019t miss a movie at the IMAX. I still visit this place",
          "I went with my two grandsons, both six years old. They appreciated all parts of the exhibition and keep now asking visiting again the Verkehrshaus. The only downside is the restaurant. The buffet food is OK, but for a single parent with 2 children that are not able to carry",
          "This museum is big and seems to entertain all ages. We are 56-61 and found it very interesting. There were lots of families with kids and it was clear they were having a great time. The museum is big so the kids really didn't bother us. On the contrary, it was wonderful seeing",
          "Fantastic experience, I gave my review earlier to the chocolate experience. Just as the other place, the Transportation museum is a well organised place, family friendly, interesting for all ages, everyone will find something very interesting. If you have time, it is a must see.",
          "Thinking that taking 18 and 15 year old boys to a transport museum would be a waste of time? in my experience, think again - it was great! We got the tickets to just the museum and were not disappointed there is so very much to do this is a fabulous exercise in how to make a",
          "Chocolate advanture section is not worth to spend your money. They only offer some videos to watch that you can easily find on video platforms and only one (not bulk but piece) Lindt chocolate ball. Also they took 7 chf from 2,5 year old kid. OK this is Switzerland, everything",
          "It is worth to visit especially cold and rainy days. We visited with my toddlers (4 and 2,5 Yr old). Enterence fee is high but the museum offers lots of activities for everyone. We went for half day but time was not enough to see all sections. There are an airplane and a",
          "We visited this place a while back on a trip to Lucerne. It has a nice collection of exhibits including trains, cars, planes etc. However, the arrangement of the items is not very easy to view. One of the reasons is that they are in different building blocks and the navigation",
          "This tour was in a little chocolate carriage that takes you around and shows you how they make chocolate and you also get free samples. This was one of the neat things I have ever done and it was excellent",
          "It is a lovely experience, sitting in comfortable chairs and watching presentations. The age does not matter because the films are short in interesting environment. No, the secret is not revealed but you still will learn a lot. And we loved the surprises. :) We bought the combo",
          "The museum is broken out by the types of transportation by building. You could easily spend a full day here with the displays and different hands on experiences plus the movies available. There was good information provided on each display (in English) so you could really learn",
          "this is an impressive Museum, certainly the most interesting technical Museum in Switzerland. The exhibitions are always changing, many events and a lot of space and entertainment for kids and adults. We live in Lucerne and visit that place almost each month with our Grand",
          "It was our first day in Lucerne and we really wanted to visit the Chocolate Experience and realized they were in the same location...what a win because the Transportation Museum was amazing! We purchased the all-inclusive ticket and it did not disappoint. The clerk who assisted",
          "Was a really good attraction, sitting in a cube of chocolate whizzing around the world! Learning about cocoa. Free truffles at the end coming down a chute - yummy. Not expensive either.",
          "While in the Transportation Museum, we took the Swiss Chocolate Adventure Experience. It was quite informative and fun, especially for families with children. Four to a mobile car, we were transported through a story of how chocolate is made, and we found it fascinating.",
          "We were told to expect the unexpected, and we did! This museum is the most popular in Switzerland, and exceptional in that it gathers many different attractions 'under one roof' - all mostly having to do with transportation. The train museum portion had many full-sized",
          "While there is a lot of transportation stuff here, there really isn\u2019t that much to see. Over emphasis on models of things (boats, cars, etc.). Not that it\u2019s bad but it really isn\u2019t special the way a world class museum should be. No messages- just collections.",
          "The Verkehrshaus is a well organised and wonderfully managed museum of transport, from boats to space travel. The interactive participatory models are educational and entertaining of adults as well as for young visitors. If you have an interest in old cars., steam travel, space",
          "Although this museum contains some very beautiful trains, cars and aircraft, the way they are being displayed was diasppointing. Next to the limited Monteverdi (Swiss car manufacturer) exhibit (formelerly in Basel), was a children's playground, so the documentary film was",
          "The museum itself was excellent, my kids loved it here, hugely interactive in each building and court yard, so much to see and do! We didn't quite get time to do everything and see everything. Trains, boats, planes, cars and more. We also did the chocolate adventure which tells",
          "Terrific science and transport museum. Lots of hands on things to do including helicopter and passenger jet simulators. 3D and planetarium shows. And heaps of planes, trains, cars, bikes, boats etc. We had three hours on a quiet day which was only just enough time. And if we",
          "This was our first visit to the Museum and we were totally impressed ! It was so interesting and well organized. There is also something for everyone, of every age! We were only there for a few hours but could have spent the entire day! We need to return! Loved it !",
          "This museum was ok \ud83e\udd14After reading the reviews I thought it was be cool for adults\u2014 yeah, not so much. First of all there are kids screaming everywhere. The exhibits are a little dumbed down, and frankly uninteresting. It\u2019s a bit out of the way, though we took a beautiful",
          "The English name of this museum is Swiss Museum of Transport. exhibits all forms of transport. Eg. aircrafts, you can trains, automobiles, as well as communication technology. It is a fun place for not only boys but also girls. My daughter had great fun with my husband here. I",
          "Even if you are travelling without children, there are a lot of fun things to do. Coming from an edutainment background, we really appreciate a museum with lots of hands on activities. The place is segmented into different transportation types, starting with locomotives. In",
          "This museum was amazing for kids and adults alike! Lots to learn and very interactive simulators and demonstrations. We had not gone in or known much about the museum but were very pleasantly surprised. There are about 4 to 5 buildings devoted to rail, boat, air and space.",
          "Everything is covered here from trains to cars and boats and oddly finance (how money is transferred I guess is transportation) and the chocolate adventure thing is extra but was the best part it is kind of a teacup type ride that whisks you around from station to station",
          "My 15 year old is mad about cars, so while in Lucern we decided to visit the Swiss transport museum. It is only a 5-10 minute drive out of the centre of Lucerne. There is parking, but it is pay & display. You can pay to go into the motor museum, or include the other",
          "A lot of adventures and cool stuff Must visit if in the area The kids didn\u2019t want to leave They learn and play in the same time Ships tracks tractors airplanes",
          "You can easily spend an entire day here as there is so much to do and see. Start with the Swiss Chocolate Adventure. This is a high tech ride through the chocolate making process. Then visit the separate buildings devoted to rail, road, water, and air transport. See the",
          "It\u2019s very famous for families with or without children. You need easily 3-5 hours to see everything. It is one of the most precious exhibitions and the entrence is quite ok, not too expensive. They change often with some extra exhibitions. When you stay some days in Lucerne this",
          "This museum is huge and you can easily spend the whole day exploring. There is so much to do and the exhibits are very hands on for younger children - my five year old loves it and didn't want to leave! The museum is broken down into different areas of transport and you can work",
          "Verkehrshaus der Schweiz is the main museum of transport in Lucerne, and in all Switzerland. It is a museum, where you can see a lot of kinds of transport like train, car, aircrafts, ships, etc. Really it is a very interesting museum, where there are a lot of real machines. Here",
          "Day trip from Zurich. Wonderful place. The grandchildren aged 2 & 31/2 were kept occupied in the construction site. Children as old as 10 were drawn to it and appeared to enjoy the activities and use of the child friendly machinery and tools. The area allocated to the history of",
          "Had thought our Swiss Pass would provide free entry but it was only a percentage. As we were short on time we didn't pay the price instead had a meal in the cafeteria which on this day was flat out, then looked around the free spaces where what seemed hundreds of children and",
          "Our intent was to visit the Hans Erni museum. Unfortunately, it is necessary to pay the admission price to the Transport Museum (SFr 32.00) in order to see the Erni exhibits. This is a steep price for an art museum.",
          "This is a magnificent and very impressive museum on anything that transports people: trains, boats, cars, bikes, planes, skilifts, and much much more. Everything in the collection is in absolutely meticulous shape. There are very much interactive displays and very much stuff",
          "Museum of Transportation is interest it is divided between parts focused on trains, cars, boats and planes. The train part is the best organized, the car part feels a little randomly organized, the plane part is a little sparse.",
          "The train (and train tunnel) exhibition is really interesting, as the Swiss have had to excel in train building by bitter need. However, the highlight was probably the car display, where classic vehicles are brought in by popular demand in a sort of Tetris game. I did not see",
          "We spent a fun and interesting afternoon at this museum, which is filled with beautiful old trains, wagons, cars, motorbikes, airplanes and boats. There is also an interesting exhibit about tunnels and how the Gotthard tunnel was built, which includes the new train tunnel that",
          "Discounted with our Swiss Travel Pass, we weren't expecting much. However, it was surprisingly good and one of the more enjoyable museums we visited. Each mode of transportation was well-represented and balanced, having enough to keep you truly interested and enthralled, yet not",
          "Our visit on a rainy day lasted 5.5 hours and we still didn't see everything. For the same price of the adult entrance fee (36CHF) we bought the Lucerne Museum Pass which gets you in free to 7 other museums over 2 consecutive days. The transport museum covers railways, cars,",
          "It\u2019s a fun day out for families. However, it\u2019s also great for people without kids. Lots to do and see.",
          "We took the time for this experience while waiting for our appointment at Victorinox. It was a rainy day, which slowed the visit a little as some was outside, but it didn\u2019t hinder. Great exhibits of airplanes, trains, cars... some of the vehicles are stored on racks, and",
          "This was a fascinating museum especially for the kids. Basically we adults followed the kids around and they were well occupied all day and had heaps of great experiences! They shovelled coal, rode go karts, played with toy barges, slid slides, played pinball and the list goes",
          "This Swiss transportation museum has just about everything. Planes, trains and automobiles abound, with gondolas, submarines, ships, and bicycles being represented as well. The ability to interact with the different modes of transportation is incredible, and there is a ton of",
          "This massive and well-curated museum is expansive. Displays are interactive including simulators, hands-on mechanical displays, the world's largest pinball machine, and a four-story robotic exhibit that brings artifacts to a center stage using group interaction and voting.",
          "This is a really good experience. Quite big collection of tram cars, locomotives and trains on the first room, followed by a large space with a fantastic collection of all sorts of cars, quite beautifully treated. We can also see a room dedicated to flying, with small planes,",
          "This place is amazing! Something for everyone. You can get there easily on the ferry boat, which is super nice. Lots to see and get interactive things for kids.",
          "This museum is definitely a full day experience! We only did 2 sections of it and ran out of time \ud83d\ude15.There were quite a few sections of the museum, there were boats, planes, cars, etc. We had to rush through them all because we didnt have enough time. There are lots of",
          "This museum is FANTASTIC. it is very interactive for both adults and children. The displays are excellent and genuine and you need at least 3-4 hours to experience it all. Definitely do the Swiss chocolate your with it. You'll love it. MUST DO. Best for rainy days.",
          "This place offers a museum with activities for families and children, a planetarium as well as a conference center. The latter is large, well equipped in terms of projection and sound. The hall area for cocktails and/or exhibit is full of daylight from both sides and has a long",
          "It was simply an amazing experience, and great learnings. Must do for anyone visiting Lucerne. You need to budget an entire day.",
          "I had a great time, about three hours worth, going through the past and present of Switzerland's contribution to the world of transportation. The museum is comprised of land, sea, and air/space halls with static and interactive displays for the young and young at heart. There's",
          "This is a little different and the experience lasts about 30 minutes. A motorised cart transfers you from area/screen to area/screen and you are taught how chocolate is made in Switzerland. You receive a few little samples at the end. It's based within the transport museum",
          "Wonderful museum for all the family. My childrens of 3 an 6 years old enjoyed the visit and play all day long inside and outside the structure as the museum is really family and childs friendly ! Great great great ! Self service restaurant is also good !",
          "This transport museum is fantastic for all ages, adults and children alike. There are separate areas for trains, planes, cars, ski lifts. There are many interactive features in each of the sections, including train and plane simulators. An outside 'building area' with diggers,",
          "Trains, cars, planes, boats - to name just a few. You could spend days looking at everything. Turn back time or look at today\u2019s technologies. Plenty of interactive exhibits for the kids. And when you need a rest a great cafe priced reasonably for Switzerland. A great day out and",
          "The Swiss Museum of Transport is a totally entertaining way to spend a day with your family. Upon entering we selected maps, which proved very helpful , as the museum is huge, and spread out into five plus buildings. Each represents another form of transport, from trains, to",
          "This museum contains everything, apparently without thought to selection so there is miles of walking. We were there 5 hours which, had it all been interesting, might have made up for the huge entrance fee at. \u00a387.",
          "Very good, elegant short tour, around 20 min long. Chocolates at the entrance as you wait for the cabin, next portion during the tour and at the exit. Nice, beautifully created idea, but do not expect anything too generous. Please note that this tour is not at all designed for",
          "There are lots of attractions at the Swiss Transport Museum, but we only visited the Swiss Chocolate Adventure. Adult tickets are 16CHF each, but keep an eye out for discount vouchers, we found one that entitled us to 20% off. This attraction seemed as though it had only been",
          "The Swiss are well deserved with their fine reputation with trains and this museum showcases it very well. They had everything from the past to the future with a variety of demonstrations too. We bought the complete ticket which included the Swiss Chocolate Adventure, Film",
          "I\u2019m not a huge fan of museums but this one is different. From old cars to planes to spaceships and anything between you can see it all. An absolute must while in town.",
          "We were so impressed with all of the hands-on display at this museum. The interactive displays throughout made for an enjoyable morning. After being told not to touch throughout Switzerland, my kids had fun running around and becoming a part of the experience. We added the",
          "I visited this place with my parents about 30 years ago, and I went back with my 3-year old kid yesterday. We had a blast, this museum is convenient for every generations. A true gem in Luzern.",
          "If one has any interest in transport, from boats to planes, cars and bikes, this is a must see, interactive museum including space travel now. A good choice of food at the restaurant(s) and a gift shop with chocolates, toys, models, and al to more. There is also a movie theatre",
          "I have spent several months in Luzern, but neglected to come to the Verkershaus until later. I went alone mostly to check it out, though it\u2019s a terrific place to bring children. Switzerland has many accommodations and opportunities for children and this is one not to be missed.",
          "If you are the type who likes car or vintage car then this is the place to be. This place has a vast selection of all kinds of vehicle, trains and even a plane. This place is definitely a fun place for kids and adults as it also offers virtual rides with a helicopter. The",
          "I'm looking forward to going tomorrow. However I just spent 20 minutes trying to book online in advance and gave up. I did have the English drop down selected, but am stuck at Shopping Cart level one. It won't let me advance. I don't have vouchers or promo codes. There's no way",
          "Found this museum on a tourist map and decided to check it out. An easy bus ride with a stop right in front of the museum. Displays are well laid out and quite impressive. I particularly enjoyed the automobiles and trains. Some interactive displays as well, with things to keep",
          "We spent the whole day here and had to drag our kids away. So many interactive exhibits. My boys loved every minute. Something for all ages.",
          "We had accidentally came by this place during our first visit to Lucerne. And enjoyed it so much that we brought our in-laws here as well. It is great for both kids and adults as the kids can play and the adults can learn a lot on the history of Swiss transportations.",
          "Very interesting Museum in the heart of Switzerland, you can see the history of the transport in Switzerland and how this country adaptat to the new challenges. Great Museum to learn a lot and a fun place to the kids and adults too.",
          "Amazing place to visit for people of all ages. Had great experience at IMAX. One can spend a whole day there easily.",
          "This museum needs the best part of a day to do it justice. If the weather is wet then it's a great place to spend time. Travel to the museum by boat from next to the main railway station and return to Lucerne by bus, trolley bus or train. I think the railway museum is one of the",
          "What a great Museum of Swiss Transportation History, covering land, sea and air, beautifully displayed in the vareous departments. For Railroad buffs this is a must, as well as for Car enthusiasts, and of course the Fliers.",
          "Very fun and well worth it. We went to three parts of the museum: chocolate, transport, and media. The chocolate part is... well... awesome. I mean...CHOCOLATE! Take the tour, get free chocolate, go buy chocolate. Probably the buying part is best for last since you don\u2019t want to",
          "Being a train lover this was a must-see museum but along with trains comes other modes of transportation,...airplanes ships etc And what is great about this very large indoor and outdoor museum is that it is great for adults and kids.",
          "Very good ride and informative on how chocolate is made, the process is extensive. You get free chocolate in the end of the tour, but you can't help but go to the shop and buy more! I loved the champagne chocolate!",
          "We visited the museum complex on a cool rainy day and it was warm and comfortable. There is a great range of activities including viewing the historical transport options: trains,cars,bike,boats and planes plus a theatre, planetarium and the Swiss chocolate adventure ride. We",
          "Really enjoyable attraction to visit whilst in Luzern and it was easy to get to via public transport. My fianc\u00e9 and I spent over 5 hours here and still didn\u2019t see everything! The exhibits were interesting and most had English translations and the interactive-ness of the museum",
          "I was persuaded by the reviews that mentioned how great this museum is for both kids and adults. Unfortunately, it's mostly great for adults AND kids, but not for adults alone. Don't get me wrong, the museum is really interesting and there's a lot of interactive displays and",
          "Deserves an entire day. Interactive exhibits, will keep children and adults engaged for the entire day.",
          "Amazing museum. I advice you to take at least some 4 hours if you really want to enjoy it. It has lots of interactive stuff and there's zillions of cars, planes, boats, trains and everything you can imagine to see",
          "We stayed for 3 hours and only had time to visit railway and airway halls. There were so much to see and my kids even much enjoyed the open space for pic-nic where there are mini trolleys (imitations of streetcars in different Swiss cities) to push around. If there is time,",
          "Spent a couple of days in Lucerne and this visit was high on our list. WOW were we pleased by what we saw. I can't even begin to outline what is there. Every form of transport for the last couple of centuries , plenty of \"hands on\" for all ages you just have to make the effort",
          "I visited the museum with my husband after reading a few reviews online. Most seemed to say it was worth the 32 CHF per adult, I tend to disagree. There were a few interesting things to see and the old trains and history were good. As was the car theatre, but it really is more",
          "What a great place to spend half a day roaming around and looking at trains, planes, automobiles (and motorcycles, bicycles, chair lifts, boats,...) If you have young children, there are so many interactive displays that I know could keep them busy all day long!",
          "I visited this museum with 3.5 years old. She loved it. It has so many things for kids (trains, scooters, pedal construction cars and many more). You can take a boat ride (also pedal powered). The downside is a price for adult. Even by NYC standards it was high (they should",
          "Very well laid out with separate area halls for rail, road, marine, aviation & space. Very very informative with many engaging activities for the kids at every hall... kids will be spoilt for choices... my 4 year old son didn't want the visit to finish at all!! Outside arena",
          "The Swiss Museum of Transport is, in my opinion as person who likes planes, trains and boats, a really great collection of all of the different transportation aspects unique to Switzerland. As a frequent user of trains in Europe we found that the Swiss rail system was fast, on",
          "We were there from opening to close and had 2 x 10 year olds and we still needed more time. A lot of fun and very interactive",
          "We spent about 4 hours here with our 10 and 18 year old sons. There was something for everyone. We could easily have done the whole day. Would recommend a whole day anyway because it is quite pricey and good idea to allow for your interest taking you through the whole day",
          "I have been visiting this museum since it first opened and it has been steadily becoming less and less worthwhile and has now reached the stage when i don't think i will bother to go again. The rot set in when they removed the Tourism Hall and was exacerbated when they",
          "In space exhibit building, ride in space capsule emulator, shows how\u2019s disorienting space travel can be on a gentle ride. Must do as it is very surprising how easy it is to lose track of what directionis up and down and what direction you started from. There are many fun hand",
          "With an extensive selection of trains to explore and learn about you can easily spend an hour in the train section alone. In this same area, there are activities for kids (and adults) that teach you about the mechanics and whatnot of how trains work. As you move past the",
          "A decent enough museum with a lot to see, but as we went with our toddler on a very hot day we didn't enjoy it as much as we could. For the price you pay (it's quite expensive) there wasn't enough to keep our little fella amused. Not good value, should have went for a walk",
          "I was recommended to see this place and was not disappointed. Online booking ticket did not scan. A very interest8ng place to visit. Food was nice at the cafe.",
          "This is a very large and impressive collection - lots of interactive bits, including train driver simulators - very difficult to keep the Bernina Express speed down! Large site divided into major sections, full size and model exhibits. Great model railway layout operates every",
          "lots of interactive displays, perfect for kids.Lots of old trains and an interesting timeline on building the auth goddard tunnel. the chocolate museum was located inside the transportation museum, but needed a separate admission fee ( fun , but a bit expensive for what was",
          "Visited it with my 2 kids aged 11 and 4 and the whole day did not seem enough! Has something for all age groups in the family and I would love to visit again",
          "Entertaining, informative and interactive exhibits. With a Swiss Travel Pass the entrance fee was only half of the normal 32 francs, which in my opinion is a bit pricey. Great displays and laid out in circle as you pass from one section of the museum to the next. I",
          "We visited this museum with our 4 and 7 year old boys, this is hands down the best interactive museum we have been to. more child orientated then the usual museum, but plenty here for transport buffs. Sooooo many things to do that are interesting for kids and adults, quality",
          "This tour explained how chocolate is made in detail and we enjoyed it. Plus, you got samples! Also, there was a museum there and some other adventures for children. Nice place.",
          "This museum was an unexpected delight. It has something for everyone, including a fabulous chocolate \u201cride\u201d (including free samples of Lindt chocolate), a gigantic IMAX screen with multiple movie options, vintage trains, cars, planes, boats, zepplins, virtual reality rides",
          "If u have kids then this musuem must not be missed and must be given a full days time...very informative; educational and at the same time it is great fun for kids as well as adults",
          "Wasn't quite sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised, a varied collection of trains, cars, aircraft and assorted other interesting things. Well worth a few hours to see it all. Family friendly with a chocolate shop in the foyer area. Lovely walk back into the city",
          "This place is amazing! The employees were friendly and helpful\u2014they spoke enough English for us to communicate effectively. We saw the movie Planeten\u2014it\u2019s in German, but you can ask for an audio device to listen to the English narration. The science buffs in our group enjoyed",
          "This museum is clean and filled with a wide variety of exhibits and hand-on, interactive learning experiences for children, as well as adults. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "The museum is quite interesting, it is big since it has locomotives, car, submarines and planes. It is quite entertaining for children too.",
          "Had some time before leaving Lucerne so took bus #24 to end of line & back stopping at the transportation museum. Might have been a bit pricey, but there are a couple options to choose from, so check online before buying your tickets to know what you want to do. So many fun",
          "It is truly one of the best place to visit with family. They always have something new for you. It is also a nice option to have children birthday party.",

          "You need at least 5 hours! It is a great place for children and adults, and it will help you to understand better swiss culture.",
          "I've been with my wife and two sons (5 and 7 years old). All of us really enjoyed almost everything. Definitely recommend to anyone who has kids.",
          "It was more of a giant playground than museum in my opinion. Kids were happy to use the different toys you can use there but they didn't learn much. Many different transportations are showed there. But it is seriously lacking of explanations. So basically, the price is too high",
          "This is very important place to visit in Luzern. You can take the public transport bus from the Luzern main station bus stop and able to reach there within 10 minutes. This museum is having sections of Rail transport, Road transport, Navigation, Cable-ways and Aviation. A family",
          "Yes, kids love it, but so did we. Lots of interesting exhibits: beautifully restored antique trains, cog wheel trains, the opportunity to operate a modern train simulator (much harder than I expected), cars, trucks, boats, airplanes,indoor and outdoor exhibits. I thought the",
          "Restaurants were decent and exhibits were excellent. Planetarium was a bit of a miss, but enjoyed the Swiss chocolate tour. Tip - decide on which exhibits you want to visit before payment, so you can enjoy packages. Also, not sure what a family ticket includes. Should ask.",
          "Wow where do I start? I purchased a ticket which included the Swiss chocolate adventure and the media world. You can purchase a ticket which includes the planetarium. The chocolate adventure was great. It showed the history of chocolate from the bean to the finished product.",
          "We spent four and half hours in this amazing museum. A large selection of cars from 1920 and up. A collection of trains and planes. They have a great presentation in there planetarium. Another presentation about space travel. A must see when you are in Luzern. They also offer a",
          "We were not that into transportation,but the collection of works by Swiss artist hans erni was the draw for us. And don't miss the sculptures in the outdoor garden",
          "Bigger than you think. Trains, boats, planesand history new and old. You can spend hours. Interesting.",
          "The best things in the museum were the space and air travel sections. The downside was that all the train exhibits were closed off to the public to view inside.",
          "A truly fantastic experience. The Transport museum is really a must see for all ages. We had a great experience there with the family. The trains, cars, aircraft were fabulous. Also, the room of mirrors was awesome.",
          "Honestly, A transportation museum would have been the last thing on my list of things to do, but what a surprise! We did have a guide, which probably made it more interesting. However, we were just amazed at all the museum had to offer and how much history of Switzerland it",
          "We had the best time in luzern at the transport museum. Chocolate experience was wonderful & the museum is highly recommended for people of all ages. Recommended time is minimum 4 hours.",
          "The Swiss Mueseum of Transport is a very fun museum. You can test and try many things, which makes it a great visit for everyone. It also has a restaurant and movie theather with the biggest screen just next to it. Totally worth a visit as well.",
          "We had a great time at the museum for a few hours and it didn't disappoint. It has old school transportation to the up to date. It was great museum where you could thru the trains exhibit, planes, cars, bikes, and even space. We got in for free with our Swiss pass and we",
          "If you're going to Lucerne this museum should be on your list. Getting there is fun too by either by bus, boat or walking. The setting is lovely and the exhibits are exceptional. There are separate buildings for each form of transport- autos, ships, air, trains. There's",
          "This museum is great if you are interested in transports : you have different sections with all kind of transports from trains to planes. You can easily spend half a day if not a full day if you visit it with children. There is also an IMAX theater in it with movies at",
          "Somehow this just does not measure up to other transport museums in Europe. The trains cannot be entered and the entire environment is sterile. You should expect a lot more for CHF 60 for two. The French, Dutch, British, Spanish, Germans and Swedes have far superior transport",
          "We (3 adults) only did this really by chance as the weather wasn't great and I didn't want to risk a mountain trip. Easy to get to by bus (or train) from Luzern, and the bus stop was a short walk away. The museum was open before the scheduled time to sell tickets, then we waited",
          "Perfect place for kids to see and experience various modes of transportation. Almost all areas have simulation which kids love to lay hands on (train, fighter plane, helicopter, landing commercial plane etc.). Numerous outdoor activities as well within the same price. A Swiss",
          "Where will you otherwise see a full-size drill bit for boring large holes in mountains for train tunnels? Or such a great collection of train cars? Or automobiles, motorcycles, airplanes, and other forms of moving devices (including space travel)? This museum of transport",
          "Awesome museum. Has a huge range of all types of transportation and is super interactive. You can scoot around the venue, ride mini buses and trains and boats, and there's a huge digging pit for kids. There are interactive flight simulators, cable cars...everything from prams to",
          "My main interest in coming here was the Convair 990 on display, but found the trains to be actually the most interesting part of the display. I never really knew how a steam locomotive worked.",
          "Buy a museum pass! Good for two days and you are able to visit quite a few different museums for only $36 chf. I didn't notice it advertised very well. We bought ours at the train station visitors information office. Well worth it! There is so much to do, but a little confusing",
          "Visit the old swiss airplane and read the story about swissair/swiss from the beginning until today. Many old railway locomotives to look at, a submarine boat and many more interesting things. Worth a visit for young and old, spend at least 1-2 hours there. Nice walk (about 30",
          "My son loves cars,so that's why we wanted to visit this museum together.It is one of the best museums I have ever been.Very entertaining,a lot of things to try,touch and explore.Had a great ride on a mini train inside the museum.The one thing we had a problem with was,to get a",
          "This Museum that explains all the Swiss transportation includes hundreds of exhibits that are spread out across several buildings. This is a great place for kids as they have an interactive play area outside for children to interact and use their imagination! You can spend hours",
          "Compared to many other transportation museums is this is not spectacular but if you've never been to one it's an enjoyment.",
          "Of course if it's raining everyone in town will be there with their kids. I don't consider myself to be a curmudgeon, but kids running around under foot and making noise made this place unpleasant for me. Our guided tour spent a lot of time on trains and the Gotthard tunnel",
          "Amazing and interactive! If you enjoy museums that teach you and let you and your family fave fun at the same time this is the perfect museum for you. It had many activities for all ages. I suggest going earlier in the day to devote about 4-5 hours if you want to cover",
          "The museum has all modes of transportation from cars to boats to planes. There many games and simulators to try. Many of the attractions are open so you can walk inside (ex trains, cable cars). Big play area for small children. Average food hall.",
          "This museum has all things pertaining to Swiss transportation. Great for kids and very interesting for adults. Indoors and don't miss the stuff outdoors, too.",
          "I have been to many great science and engineering museums, but this one may have been the best yet. The exhibits tell the story of transportation, mainly in Switzerland, from the Roman era until today. The section on trains and tunnel building was really amazing to me. I",
          "Need at least half a day. A blast if you bring kids. Beautiful lakefront for picnic before of after, take the boat back to town.",
          "The Swiss Museum of Transport is an engaging for adults as children. During our visit it appeared that every child in Switzerland was also there, but their interaction with every exhibit, both indoor and out were a joy to watch throughout the day (albeit after lunch, several",
          "Neat experience. The museum is divided into various sections, all focusing on different transportation modes. There is a scale model of the Gotthard tunnel. There are classic cars on display, and ski lifts throughout the ages. The planetarium has a scale photograph of",
          "Good attraction for the kids. The chocolate tour by lindt is a very nice exebihsion. The rest is also nice - but there are plenty of a like museums around the globe",
          "Plenty to do and see for children and grown-ups alike. They got everything really. Make sure you have enough time. I really like trains and for me that was the best part of the museum.",
          "First off one day is never enough if you plan to visit all areas that are on offer! We visited the museum of transport alone and this took well over three hours, adding all other attraction would have taken many more hours and simply overwhelmed each one of us, especially the",
          "The museum is a real treat especially those of us who are in love with trains, boats, cars, ships or planes .. children included :) Highlights for me were the aircraft and the train driver ride simulators. The aircraft simulator is a real treat and make sure you keep some time",
          "Not worth visiting if you have limited time in Lucern. Such museums can be visited at others places. while at Lucern there are far better places to see unless you are fond of transport machines",
          "Situated close to the Chapel Bridge and Lake Lucerne, this museum is worth a visit if your children are fans of steam locomotives. Our family wasn't that impressive with the interactive games, most of which is out of order. The highlight for us, instead, is the outdoor Road",
          "Extremely well maintained with live demonstrations, videos, sound effects and various games. Require atleast 4-5 hours or more to explore it fully. Helicopter ride simulation is awsome.",
          "Enjoyed the visit. Need at least three hours to do justice to your visit. The small steam engine train was the best. Don't miss your ride on it. It's not just for kids & their parents. It's for all! The collection of trains & cars was amazing. The way the car you choose to see",
          "Travelling with our 7 yr old son we spent a very enjoyable day at the museum 11am-6pm. Like all things in Switzerland, it is pricey at 96CHF for our family ticket which included a tour \"the Swiss chocolate adventure\" (well worth it). The museum is very interactive with more",
          "We visited this museum upon recommendation. It wasn't worth the visit. It was expensive and the place was overrun with kids pushing into us all day.",
          "kids will love it - keep a day for this trip - there are many shows - the chocolate journey moview is something no one should miss - mouth watering journey",
          "Amazing collection of transport through the ages. Airplanes,trains, cars and more. If you like the above this museum is a must",
          "It was great to visit the museum again after so many years. There was all I remembered was most enjoyable and many more additions to that. The museum really deal in great detail with all means of transportation, and with interactive displays it is a really engaging place for",
          "This museum would be a wonderful place to bring your children. Young-uns' were everywhere - we could see a lot of activities going on outside for families. We only went for the chocolate experience because we heard it was informative and fun (and you get free chocolate)! The",
          "Drove to Luzern for a fun weekend. We stayed in the city and visited the museum on Saturday and Sunday. A lot of things to see and do for our 5 year old. Surely not the cheapest museum in the world, but then again it is in Switzerland therefore by default it would be",
          "We visited with two 12 year olds during the summer holidays. I can highly recommend the museum. Real mixture of old and modern, thoroughly pleasant and humorous staff, very clean and well laid out. Something for everyone to do young and old. Very interactive lots to get involved",
          "We were positively sorprised with all the things inside and interactivnes of exibites. We thougt to stay an hour and we stayed for 3, and thats because it was closing . All best for this place",
          "There is a lot to do here so be sure to leave adequate time. Each mode of transportation is covered in a thorough interactive manner. It was very hands on. There is a lot of physical activity for kids such as riding toy buses and shoveling. Our son liked the train simulator.",
          "The Museum of Transport is truly an experience - especially if you are a train or car enthusiast. The displays are in several languages and quite innovative",
          "If you have additional time this place is good to spend few hours. I found the section on railways quite good. You can see real engines and bogies that are over 100 years old. I got to know a lot about history of Swiss railways. Kids can have fun in the cars and motorbike",
          "Always a lovely day out with the kids. You do not see all in one day, so either plan a trip for a few days, or be aware that you will be back for more. You get to see details about trains, cars, planes, cable cars, tunnels etc etc. You can experience and do thighs yourself. They",
          "Like so many more modern museums the exibits are presented attractively and informatively with a number of interactive presentations to maintain interest. We did not have children with us but we could see what a wonderful place it would be for them. Well worth a visit and very",

          "Very good option if going with kids. We didn't have much time though. Would surely recommend this place.",
          "We gave this museum only 4 hours, but I think people should plan this for atleast 6-8 hours and do the other stuff as well including planetarium. The transport museum is huge. There are 4 major halls and also a outside section in the open areas of the 4 halls. It is really",
          "What was supposed to be a 2 hour visit became a 5 hour stay. Both the kids and adults in our group had a fun time climbing in and out of the various transports craft (trains, boats, planes) on display. A must-try (on an empty stomach) is the aircraft simulator.",
          "I stayed in Hergiswil so I suggest that the good way is to take boat/ship to go to the museum because the museum is opposite to the pier, just a few mins to go to the museum. Next to the pier, there is a beach. People have to pay for using beaches and facilities in Switzerland.",
          "A good place to spend a couple of hours especially if you are locomotive or car enthusiast... well laid out exhibits, strikingly the early electric forms of locos... it seems Switzerland was in the vanguard of design. There is plenty to attract youngsters and teenagers... boats,",
          "Its something you dont visit every day. Really organised, variety of items and you can learn the history of transportation. And a surprise in it, the Lindt Chokolate Museum. If you go to Luzern, you must visit it",
          "All i can say was even though it was my 2nd visit,i still enjoyed myself alot. Much more attractions were added like the chocolate adventure and more transport related activity at the outdoor area. We spent 3hours and still could not finish! Definitely a place where i can",
          "Easily accessible by train, bus, boat. Big array of exhibits ranging from cars, boats, planes, trains. Especially enjoyed the car theatre where one can choose for example, a car by pressing a red button and the car lowered to a turntable platform by a robotised system for",

          "I have to say, I was a bit pessimist before our visit, especially cause my partner works in transport, and been into a few transport museums before. But how wrong I was. This place is a truly amazing day out for everyone and you can easily spend a whole day going though all the",
          "Excellent day out most highly recommended, something for all the family. I only visited the transport museum, but the site also has other attractions, including a planetarium. The museum itself is very reasonably priced, and discount are available. There are several building",

          "From train to cars, boats to planes, you can see it all here from the very first (steam locomotives) to the most moderns (space satellites). Place is pretty large and you will easily spend 4hrs walking around and experiencing things both indoor and outdoor. This is a good place",
          "Perfect rainy day solution as there is so much to do here. Incredibly expensive if you do everything (especially as us brits are used to free museums) but the quality is excellant. I wouldn't bother with the choc experience (very dull) or the film as these are extra but the",
          "It's a one of its kind place. Must see in Luzern. Very informative and thought provoking. Takes usually 2-3 hrs. Reaching there is very easy with 6,8,24 no buses from Luzern. Bust stop is bang beside. There is a beautiful lakefront which one must not miss.",

          "Brilliant! Lots of activities for the kids, both outdoor and indoor. Boat, mini-train (need to purchase train tickets) rides were fun. There are also scooters in the outdoor for children. The helicopter simulator was a bit boring, didn't worth the queuing time I think. Children",
          "We decided to spend a day in lucerne as we were not staying there . We started with transport museum It was very well made but we felt it was more for younger kids not teenagers my kids r 14 and 19 they got thoroughly bored it was half day wasted . The second half we went to the",

          "I spent the best part of a day here with my son and although the main museum is similar to a lot of other transport focused places it was still fun. The best part was the Planetarium and the enthusiasm of the staff. Although the main feature was in German the translation headset",

It is well organised and updated to new missions like China mission trip to the moon etc. But a pity the live commentary is only in German. Maybe in the future if they get to work on an English version will be cooler.",

          "Opening times are too short to see everything on a dayticket. Why close already at 5??\nThe food was overpriced in the restaurant. 28 Francs for a plate with salad? As if the entry price was not already high enough, more profit was needed to \u2026",
          "World class. Absolutely enjoyed it as a family, my Son was overjoyed with all the train, automobiles, planes. And the play rides such as manual carting, boating and mini train rides are excellent for children. We missed the shows as we were too preoccupied with all these activities",

So much variety and effort all in one place - it's really impressive.\n\nDon't forget to go to the aircraft section which is a bit hidden away! That area had some of the best and most interactive elements.",

          "One of the best museums in the world. Technology being used is state of the art",
          "The chocolate tour was fun. They gave cute little carts. Each seats around 5-6 people. They usually put one group in each. These move on an automated path. It was just about 20 min long tour.\n\nThe tour itself may not have something that you already don't know. However presentation is fun.",

          "Super interesting exposition for practically any age (our son was here first at about 18 months). The two well-known downsides are the ticket price and the cafe. We haven't tried the sit-down one yet, but the other feels like a roadside cafeteria at a gas station, from food quality to personnel attitude.",

          "We got a day pass for 56 CHF and easily spent 5-6 hrs inside. We didn't have time to see each and every exhibit. Good time to spend with kids.

          "Excellent place for geeks! We have been here several times already, each time several hours. It is huge, and there are so many interesting things to see and do. I don't recommend the cantine though. I ate there once and the food wasn't very good.",

          "Worth visiting. However, the show that was supposed to be played did not play at the stated timing on the board. When I tried asking the staff, the staff just said, if you want to see the show I can show you. The show is nice but why doesn\u2019t the staff play the show according to",
          "The Glacier Garden and the Glacier Museum are located right next to the Lion Monument --all easy to get to with the public transportation and a little walking. Admission is included with the Swiss Rail Pass. This is a great place to get information on how the area was formed.",
          "My wife and I went to the Glacier Gardens without doing much research. It was an interesting visit highlighting glacial potholes dating back to the Ice Age and rock and formations created. There was also a nice house doubling as a museum. There was a walk up the hill to a tower",
          "I think it was the most amazing museum I've ever visited. It is very interactive and educational, the perfect place to learn about glaciers and climate change.",
          "We were headed to the Lion statue and we had some time to kill, so we checked out the Glacier Garden. We had more fun than we expected! The glacier exhibit is cool (don't miss the hands on part where you can watch icicles form and disappear with the push of a button), and we",
          "Our family visited the Glacier Garden for about an hour while walking in Lucerne. The setting by the dying lion statue was wonderful. First of all, the glacially scoured potholes were amazing to an earth scientist like myself. The rest of the family also marveled at them.",
          "Great combination of glacier artefacts, a very interesting museum about history and geology, and a 1896 mirror maze. We loved it!",
          "This attraction overwhelmed us with disparate information. Glacier information was good. The historical house might be fine as a separate tour, but it tries to do too many things at once.",
          "It's hard to explain the charm of this attraction, but we're so glad we went. It gives a glimpse of what touring the continent in the 19th century might have been like. There are geological potholes to wander past, a climb up a very high watchtower to marvel at the vistas below,",
          "Wanted to see the lion next door but lots of people, so went and found this place. What a jewel, the first part was fascinating and amazing. Have never seen anything like this that large. Then we went in the museum, all for the same price. And that was great the old house and",
          "I'm a German geography student and I already knew a lot from uni. However, it was absolutely great to see all the things I knew about \"in action\" and I learned new things. It was so interesting and I loved to walk around and read all the information and I could have stayed there",
          "I visited the Glacier Garden with my two young kids as we have the Swiss Museum Pass. It was fairly eclectic - the glacial rocks, an exhibition on the ice age, an old Swiss house, a mirror maze (a hit with he three year old), a tower overlooking town and some fish and rabbits.",
          "Traveler Tip: If you have a Swiss Rail Pass, you get admission to this and many other attractions all over Switzerland. We used an 8-day pass and never paid for transportation or attractions after that. This attraction is right next to the Dying Lion Monument. - Also worth",
          "Pleasantly suprised by this attraction. Lots to see including the glacier caves themselves, a historical home, a fun mirror maze and an observation deck with great views. Totally worth the admission",
          "Great ski and winter hiking holiday. The hotel is wonderful, the food is delicious and the stuff is welcoming. Highly recommended !!!",
          "This is an unusual attraction, a mixture of museum and historical house, with our favorite bit being the lookout tower at the top of the steps. Gorgeous views of the city, and nobody else around at the time of day (early on a weekday).",
          "It is very cool, my son enjoyed it...if you are in Tittlis you must check in in the Ice Cave :) The only thing is, if you dont have a proper boots it feels very sleepery!",
          "I had not heard of the Glacier Garden, when we initially made our plans to Lucerne. It happens to be right next to the Lion Monument, and was such a terrific surprise. The museum focuses on the glacial history of the area, has an extensive indoor museum, and a small but lovely",

          "We were family with 3 kids (7,4,2). The place offers a surprisingly big variety of attractions. Some things that are not to miss for kids: A. Going up the tower B. Enjoying the variety of twisted mirrors C. The mirror maze Some additional tips; A. \"City parking\" on",
          "Me and my brother were trying to find attractions that were included on the Swiss Museum Pass and this was one of them. We didn't know what to expect, and upon arrival, found ourselves even more confused. The entrance is what looks like a large Butlins tent, covering a dug-out",
          "The Glacier Garden is located about 15mins walk from the Lucern railway station. It is situated just besides the Lion Monument, on of the must-see in Lucerne. Admission costs CHF15(adult), but if you have a Swiss travel pass, entrance will be free. Once you enter the garden,",
          "We hadn't planned on taking this place in, but was included in our city museum pass, and we're glad we stopped. Interesting place to visit, and located right beside the Lion carving. Be sure to go through the mirrors - it's fun.",
          "The Glacier Garden was interesting and informative, the lookout gives you an amazing view over Lucerne and I really enjoyed the water-based artworks. The best thing for me, though, was the mirrors. My friend and I had a great laugh working our way through the maze. It really is",
          "We never planned to go to this place. We just went to Lion monument and saw this place and entered it on the spur of the moment. The ticket was hefty so we were a little hesitant. But after the visit ,we felt the visit was really worth it.We began the tour with archaeological",
          "Was very interesting learning about the glaciers. A must do is the hall of mirrors. Kids will have a blast there.",
          "This attraction is situated right beside the famous Monument of the Dying Lion. It charges a fee, but we got in because of our Combo rail pass. There were not too many visitors inside. Upon entering, the first section we saw was the glacier garden. There are several potholes",
          "The museum is sited for its geology but also has amazing collections of minerals flora and fauna. We only had 90 minutes and saw about half. We will return to finish the visit on a future occasion",
          "...and yet, here we are. I didn't expect much, in fact. However, this random collection of exhibits and natural wonders and strange dolls and mirror maze and old style Swiss house was a super interesting juxtaposition. The Glacier Garden was able to capture my attention for at",
          "It is quite educational and neat to see how the earth has evolved during the different periods. Unfortunately it was cold and rainy so we did not longer and read as much as I would have liked to. Wish I could return.",
          "So fascinating and interesting to walk through. Something you don't see elsewhere. We had a bit of altitude sickness while going up, but it was worth it all the same. Don't miss it!",
          "It's very beautiful and a must visit, but the amenities out of it keeps it so hot that it makes you nauseate, like Jungfraujoch",
          "Almost everyone who comes to Lucerne visits the Lion monument, and the Glacier garden is immediately adjacent, so why not? It does not require a lot of time and is not too expensive, and the formations are both interesting and naturally beautiful.",
          "There are glaciers views and exhibits about glacier process and a slideshow but we were not impressed. It takes @an hour to see it all and It cost $15 CHF per adult which is pricy but suggest get the Museum Pass for $36CHF that you can use for 2 days and visit 8 museums. We",
          "It is very nice museum that tells you history of Lucerne ( it appears that Lucerne was a beach couple million years ago), and has mirror rooms where you can get lost easily, and a tower from which you can see the whole city, and many other things that are worth of seeing.",
          "The carving of te Monument of the Lion is a strong sculpture. The events of 1792 are TRAGIC AND SAD. You admired the loyalty and duties of these swiss soldiers, assassinated through the mob in Versailles.",
          "Very close to the lion monument is Glacier Garden, a seemingly thrown-together group of exhibits and attractions that may or may not have anything to do with Switzerland's glaciers. You'll learn a little about geology and geography if you are interested enough to really focus on",
          "This was an unusual attraction (free with our Swiss Travel Pass). The glacier exhibits were interesting. Then we saw what seemed like way too many scale reproductions of various mountainous regions in Switzerland (not that interesting). Onward to the parts of the old house,",
          "The glacier garden was a great experience and the accompanying museum had a lot of interesting information. The Alhambra mirror maze was a fun experience for all of us including our teenagers.",
          "We visited not quite knowing what to expect. We thought we might we stay an hour and ended up staying three. It was extremely good value attraction for family with young children (8 and 5). So much to see and do. And intelligent, well thought out exhibits and attractions for a",
          "great museum is included in swiss pass mirror maize is just amazing not too big has inside the formation of lucerne",
          "This museum is up a few steps just next to the Lucerne Lion and well worth visiting. Travelling with our 7 yr old son, he got a lot more out of this visit than the lion! It has the footprint of a glacier from the ice age fantastically preserved with amazing potholes. Everything",
          "The museum tells a lot about the ice age and displays some impressive things. They give some flyer with all the informations (in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, ...). You can just walk around and when you reach the numbered places you can read the",

          "This is an attraction very close to the Dying Lion of Lucerne monument, which means it is easy to see both at once. Our Swiss Rail Pass secured us free entry to the Glacier Gardens, as well as many other museums and attractions around Switzerland. The Glacier Gardens themselves",
          "Someone mentioned checking this out, and it honestly seemed more kid-centric. But, I was pleasantly surprised that it really isn't. There was a lot to see, and learn, through the museums. The mirror hall was also a lot of fun. Don't forget to walk up the tower for a great view",
          "Not knowing what to expect, it was a delight to explore the geology, history and ice-age background to the Alps and Lucerne. Amazing mirror maze has to be 'done' and the glacial melt holes with fossils aplenty were really interesting, as were the terrific number of relief maps -",
          "We visited on a rainy day . My grandson really wanted to walk through the mirror maze and that was his favorite thing .",
          "As another review mentions - this is an odd mixture of exhibits but we enjoyed using up a couple of hours here. There is an educational part about glaciers, some interesting relief maps or panoramas of the area and the Swiss mountains in general, a viewing tower, a fish-pond and",
          "We enjoyed the Glacier Garden. It's an odd mixture of exhibits: the unique glacier formations and geological curiosities, a good educational exhibit on climate change, a historic Swiss house, a pretty outdoor area with a fish pond, and a Victorian mirror maze. There is certainly",

          "If you travel to Lucerne by train, when you get out of the station go to to your left and walk to the Jesuit Church. From there you can see the painted building on the other side of the river. It is a short walk across the picturesque Chapel Bridge (Kapellebrucke) to the lake.",
          "You go through life thinking and being convinced that you know quite a lot about nature and climate change and then you visit this absolutely fascinating site which makes you feel I know nothing! Incredible site. Lots to see. Lots to learn. Learnt so much about glaciers. Loved",
          "We arrived in Lucerne around 2pm on a Saturday and were just walking around the city so decided to make out way to the Glacier Garden. The Lion Monument outside the museum is beautiful. The museum itself is really interesting for the first 20 minutes or so...then gets a little",
          "I love these kinds of educational museums. They are very fascinating. I'm glad I took the time to visit",
          "I didn't think I wanted to visit one more science-oriented museum but I went anyway. Boy, was I surprised at this interesting and unique place. There is much geology here since there is a lot about glaciers and their effects on the earth. In addition to the geology, there is",
          "in the heart of lucerne old town, the glacier garden is a place which is free to visit with swiss travel pass. it is walking distance from the main cathedral [church] of lucerne. Alpenium, Lion Monument and Glacier Garden are just adjacent to each other, so you can combine them",

          "We are not museum folks as would rather spend vacation time exploring the outdoors. With 3 days of rain, snow and gloomy skies, we decided to purchase the Lucerne Museum Pass. What a bargain. Because we had access to the Glacier Garden with the pass, we figured \"why not\". Boy",
          "i brought my family here mainly to see the dying lion but decided to pay for the Glacier Garden admission. The glacier part was educational, but my family enjoyed the Swiss house and the mirror maze more. if you have time in lucerne, i would recommend to stop by, but you",
          "In a word, \"Amazing\", the most fantastic history lesson We have ever had. What was even more amazing was the way in which this historic place was discovered and the insight of the man responsible. This is truly an unbelievable glac\u00e9 at the history of the last Ice age. A must see",
          "A pretty cool museum in Lucerne with a neat maze of mirrors at the end. We also enjoyed seeing the lion carved in the hill side right next to the museum. Well worth the money to see the fossils and glacier related artifacts.",

          "Visited with children age 9 and 7 and geologist husband. Very interesting and unique site. Visit could be vey brief but to bulk it out and justify the entrance fee there is a lot of other stuff here, some of it a bit abstract but we did enjoy it.",

          "I go to a lot of museums, but I've never been to one like this. There's a lot of information on the formation and destruction of glaciers, with particular application to Swiss glaciers. I learned a lot and enjoyed it. In the museum there is also a mirror maze, which seemed kind",
          "I went to see Lion Monument, was unintentionally discovered this place which is just next door only. Since I carried Swiss Pass, I am glad I am entitled to go in for free since this is part of museum package. It is interesting to know how it was make 20000 years ago, don't miss",

          "Plan on several hours to enjoy and learn about glaciers, the mountains etc. We spent about 2-3 hours here. We even had a hot dog on the patio. There is so much to see. We saved the maze until last. I would say is should be high on your list of things to see. You can buy a",
          "This museum was very interesting explaining a huge amount of information about the glaciers, how Switzerland's landscape was produced and the history of discovery in the Lucerne area. Well worth the visit if you have an interest in the history of the area.",
          "I live in glacier country and while seeing the Lion statue noticed this museum. For $15 franc I was going to pass until I noticed it was free with the Swiss Rail pass. It was a fun and interesting experience, would be impressive to see the entire hillside in this form without",
          "After reading the reviews of this Museum we decided to give it a try. From the outside it doesn't look like much and for 15 Swiss Franks a person we weren't sure if it would be worth the expense. It absolutely was! This museum is like 3 different museums in one. You will see",
          "This garden is worth spending a couple of hours in. At first you see evidence that Lucerne was once covered by a glacier with actual potholes, striated rocks and fossils. Then move to the museum, do not miss the film, the excavated finds are astounding. The Amrein house is",
          "I loved this place. It was excellent value. It had geological features, history, mirror maze, and a lookout. It had a depth in the science behind that I really enjoyed. One of the exhibits was the creation of frost. This exhibit supercooled a metal platform and was showing the",

          "A great two hours visiting the Glacier Garden. Without doubt it was very educational and one learnt about the continued receding of the glaciers in the Swiss Alps. It is a place where one needs to take maximum advantage of the various elements rather than simply moving around",
          "Spent a few hours in this museum. An informative display, explaining the impact of melting glaciers and the need to protect our planet. A lot to see: geology of glaciers, fossils, history, geography and culture. The other attractions like the mirror maze, the viewing gallery",

          "2 adults and 4 teens all had a great time here. We were fortunate to have it to ourselves most of the time and were laughing nearly to tears. Definitely worthwhile. We didn't actually spend much time on the actual exhibits but they looked well done. Interesting geologic site.",
          "We discovered this place on accident, walked right to it and decided to check it out. Kids had a blast, it was very informative about the history of Switzerland and the glaciers. 3-D maps of the country were wonderful to look at and read about. If you have a couple of hours in",

          "The exposed base of a glacier and the house of the man who found it and preserved it in the late1800s form the basis of a great experience for young and old. We spent a number of hours there and could have stayed longer. The fun highlight was the mirror maze. Dating back well",
          "Great way to spend an hour or two at the end of the day. Curious mix of glacier rocks, Swiss home, viewing tower, geology/science exhibition and... a hall of mirrors! To be fair, hall of mirrors was awesome and hilarious - not a carnival curvy mirror place, but a proper maze",
          "Very cool place! Tough to explain in a few words here but absolutely fascinating. The round holes carved into the rock are beautiful as they are intriguing. The have a great demonstration of how the happened with a rock turning in place with a stream of water. Definitely worth",
          "This is definitely not to be missed if you visit Lucerne. It has an appeal to all ages and interests and the past is brought to life by amazing presentation. A fascinating insight into the effect of climate changes over the centuries.",
          "The glacier grooves and pot holes are great illustrations of the impact of glaciers. Seeing the real thing (as opposed to a recreation) is impressive. The exhibits on glaciers is informative and attractive.",
          "An old museum that tells the story of how the glaciers found at the museum was formed. Good for aspiring geologists but we were just there because it was next to the Lion Monument and this was covered by the Swiss Pass.",
          "The glacier garden is one of the most educative experience one can enjoy. The pot hole dating back to the age age, the rocks that have been formed with the sea shells and the imprints of a palm leaf found on a rock. Are really interesting, and do make us realise that the world",
          "Combine this visit with the adjacent Lion Monument. It's a well done museum which descibes the glacial formation of the Lucerne area geology. It also covers the history of Lucerne. It's worth your time.",
          "In my opinion in lucerne, besides walking across the chapel bridge, you want to see the l\u00f6wendenkmal and the glacier garden. The glacier garden consists of some quite different \"themes\". The glacier garden itself, which is very impressive, and a well done small museum abput",

          "You need not be a paleontologist to be blown away by this museum. See the physical evidence which proves that Lucerne once stood at sea level and that a large inland sea was home to all kinds of sea creatures. There is SO much to do here, including the inside displays, climbing",

          "This place is worth a couple of hours if you are travelling with your kids, or if you are an adult who loves geology. It is hidden away near the dying lion monument. Inside you will see exhibits that cover the ice age around Luzern. The displays are imaginative and fun. Outside",
          "This is such a good way to go learn a bit about Switzerland and Luzern and especially recommended for people that hate museums like me. You will not feel like you are at a museum but it feels more like an adventure and so much fun especially the mirror house and the mirrors at",

          "This museum is right next to the Lion Monument. The different exhibits are numbered so you can easily follow the pamphlet/guide and learn about the glaciers and Ice Age. There is a mirror maze at the end which was really fun! I spent about 1.5-2 hours here.",
          "There's more to do here that you think there is - the highlight for my kids is the very fun mirror maze that entralled them to no end, and after you exit the mirror maze there are some funny mirrors that either make you fatter or thinner, taller or shorter - made all of us",
          "I stopped here on a whim and I'm glad I did. It costed 15 Swiss franks to get in. It had a tiny entrance so I was worried the attraction wouldn't be worth it. I walked in and the attraction itself wasn't that interesting but there was a glacier museum that is worth checking out.",
          "This place is a must see! The fee was 15 chf which covered the glacier garden, museum/house and labyrinth. It was so interesting. All the information is in English. From the very top of the glacier garden you can see the lion monument. We spent about 2 hours there walking slowly",
          "Here you can really see how powerful water is, esp, on glaciers. You will see ancient stone mills, really impressive - they are real from the ice age when the Reuss Glacier around Lucerne. In addition you will find a funny mirror labyrinth.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, spending time enjoying the diverse exhibits and attractions. The mirror maze is both fun and historic, the museum and cultural exhibits interesting, and the geological displays fascinating. Don't miss it!",
          "I was visiting the Bourbaki panaroma and walked up to the Lion monument then I saw Glacier garden. I had the museum pass this went in without any idea. In the end, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Many information on Glacier and I really Liked the old Swiss house. Do",
          "The place is in the heart of Lucerne and definetly worth a visit. It's informative, and great family program. My son was a fan of the mirror labyrinth most of our time we spent there:-). If you want to have a nice view of Lucerne you can do that too, we took some really nice",
          "Visited this for the first time, and was really impressed. Looking at the real glacier tracks right in the middle of the city! Interesting exhibition about glaciers in general. Easy to get to from the main train station, 15 mins. Walking.",
          "It was great to see theses Glacier holes as we have just come back from Alaska and walked on the glaciers and seen the holes in all there glory pre thaw. Really incredible story how this was discovered by a gentleman digging to make a wine cellar . I would visit again The",
          "My husband and I rather visited this attraction as an after thought late in the day. Indeed, the lady at the ticket counter gave us a discount because we had less than an hour to visit the attraction. I easily could have spent 2 hours here--I loved this attraction. First, I",
          "The tourist Brochure read was not completely encouraging about this attraction. However we had a museum pass and decided that we would look as it would not cost us any extra. We were amazed at the information there. First the glacier garden and then the old Swiss house. We spent",
          "Truly a delight for children and adults alike. The natural history and history of people, the mirror installations, the hike to the top of the hill, proximity to the Lion Monument and even the restaurant are all marvelous.",
          "This place is worth a visit if you are in the area to see the Lion monument. It has many educational and entertaining features to it. do not miss the Tower and the Mirrored Palace. Kids will enjoyed it too.",
          "very educative and u can have a good time in the peaceful green surroundings. buy artefacts and personally bought semi precious stones in raw forms. love the shop. !!",
          "This is a pretty little place to spend a bit of time. It a real glacier remant and has some educative sections for u and the kids. The short film, the mirror maze etc add to the highlight. would be fantastic is there was food somewhere close too ..( but that's just me !!)",
          "The mirror palace was made of 99pcs of mirror,its unbelievable when you entered into the palace..cant tell where is real and where is reflection",
          "Very informative to tell about how glaciers are formed. The mansion showing how rich people live in the past years was impressive. Don't miss the mirror hall, it was very interesting, especially when you have kids.",
          "More extensive than the signs would indicate and worth a visit. Well presented media and interesting gardens and house.",
          "Very entertaining mirror maze and informative museum with information about history of glaciers and environment",
          "Easily approachable and in heart of Lucerne. The mirror maze is enjoyable for kids. And you can do the Lion Monument and the museum at one go. I would recommend to go there but not spend the entire day there.",
          "Lovely place to visit. All sorts of different interesting, fun and adventurous little things to do. Don't forget the mirror maze",
          "Went here because it was included in our Swiss Pass for free entrance. The mirror maze was good entertainment for the children and the rock glacier was interesting to see. I wouldn't pay to come in though, would rather do other things. But good if you have the time and the Swiss",
          "This museum is nice, you learn about the glacier covering Luzern a long time ago. But the cool thing is at the end. There is a mirror labyrinth and it is funny to go there with friends and split then try to find the real person back :-)",
          "This is right next to the Dying Lion monument and was really interesting. My family didn't know what to expect. It was a mixture of so much that it kept us intrigued and marvelled at what was in this place. So much to see, learn and lots of interactive information. My 10yo son",
          "If you are visiting the Lion then you can miss this place, it right next door. Some interesting exhibitions and a great mirror maze makes it a fun way to kill an hour or so.",
          "Visited as a family with 2 kids. Glacier garden was educational while the mirror maze (within the same compound) was enjoyable esp to the kids. Since it is just next to the Lion Monument, which you will probably visit as a \"must'see\" in Lucerne, why not just drop by.",
          "Not sure what I was expecting but not this. Strangely disjointed with no real flow to the site. The mirror maze was good though.",
          "Combines a garden, glacier rocks, historical house and furniture, history of Lucerne, models of area, working model train with audio-visual display, 896 Alhambra maze of mirrors and a wonderful view of the Lion of Lucerne. Excellent scientific displays about changes in climate",
          "If you happen to visit the Lion monument in Lucerne (which is highly recommended), this attraction is right next door. You dont even need an entry ticket if you have a swiss pass. There is a very good collection, display of the geological history & fossils around lucerne area.",
          "At the entrance, the place looked small but as you walked on, there's so much more to see. The glacier garden is just a small part of it but there's actually a museum with information on how the place was formed over the centuries and on the top floor, there are some exhibits",
          "The Glacier Garden is hidden away behind the Lion Monument. It's a park and a Museum containing ice age exhibits, which is very educational, a map of Luzern from 1792 and a mirror maze that will delight.",
          "The museum is not just a garden as its name implies. The \"garden\" is a pool of rocks which educate about glacial erosion and such. Apart from that there is an extensive museum with many facts to teach such as what's trapped in a glacier, the physical nature of ice, etc., also",
          "I was amazed by all the fact we got from this visit. Did not know about all the Glaciers in this area",
          "Gletschergarten is a small park with several different attractions within. Interesting and educational. Seemed expensive but I was not disappointed and glad we did it.",
          "I love that they don't really know how these stones and holes came to be but they are weirdly cool and it's a nice little ramble around the museum, which is right up the street from the Lion monument, so it's all easy to see in an hour or two.",
          "I loved this place. Well set out, easy to follow visitor guide to ensure you see the attractions in the right order and don't miss any, oh yea and there's lots of geology for a massive geology nerd like me :) My boyfriend (who I dragged along and is not a geology nerd like me)",
          "This is an unusual place in that there are lots of glacial rocks in an interior building. There is also a faux glacier to walk through. Quite costly without the benefit of the Swiss Passes we had",
          "The potholes are some of the biggest I've ever seen, the fossil collection is beautifully labeled and displayed, and moving from the geology to the family home of the geologist made it all alive. The steps up to the tower were though a beautiful, peaceful garden... this gem is",
          "This little treasure is well worth a visit if you have time to spare. It was interesting and informative and there is a great view from the top of the Look Out Post. There is a small terrace with a coffee shop and shop.",
          "My girlfriend and I took a look round this place after seeing the Lion monument, well worth a visit, give a couple of hours to this place and won't regret it. It has a wonderful hall of mirrors mase, an old creaky house with all the trimmings of history of geology and a",
          "My Swiss wife had visited here as a child, and I was expecting a rather tired view of old rocks polished by a glacier. Yes, there is that, but it's more impressive than I expected and there are several other attractions as well. Kids will love the rabbits, the fish pond and the",
          "Its not that boring as I expected it to be...loved the 18 century house and furniture display...also the watch tower was pretty scenic...The best part wasthe house of mirrors. It was awesome. we really had fun inside getting lost as a family...",
          "Only CHF 15.-, outdoor Glacier curiosities, indoor museum, Mirror hall... Decent price for what they have to offer.",
          "Leveraging on a not very large area of exposed rock that was shaped by glaciers, this museum gives an extensive overview of glaciers and ice ages. The visit includes lots of models, video, and the \"garden\" itself. Incorporated into the visit is a walk through the mansion of the",
          "We allotted only 1.5 hours for this place. It was not enough. There is a lot to see and learn about: geology, prehistory of animals and man, glaciers around the world, social and political history of the family in the area, etc. We rushed through the 2nd half, and now we are",
          "One of the best mirror maze... Must visit... it is next to Lion Monument.. Timmings from till 17:00 in winter and 18:00 in summers..",
          "I went early to the attraction and use my Luzern card to get a discount for the entrance fee. The place is amazing as you get to learn more about the glaciers and artic. And what I love the most about this attraction is the mirror maze! Its really fun to walk around and find",
          "This is a very interesting and surprisingly beautiful place. You will get a great appreciation of Glaciers and the power of the water. Loved it.",
          "You can stay for the whole day here and still have a good time! To learn about the history of the ice glaciers and too see how the climate changing influence on the planet Earth, and all that in a very fun way - that is amazing. Also to learn about: the types of houses around",
          "We took our 5 year old here. He loved it. We enjoyed at it was educational and we learnt so much. The mirror maze isn't recommended for anyone with claustrophobia",
          "The museum was included in our pass so we didnt have to pay .. after the slight disappointment of Lion Monument, we found this museum a real turn around .. it was nice , informative, fun and adventurous.. there are funny mirrors , natural history information, a climb to a",
          "Over the holidays, my family decided to visit Luzern. Seeing the Lion carved in the side of a rock was inspiring. Next to this wonderful monument is a Glacier Museum. We went and we were very pleased. The site is well appointed and very educational. I especially liked the",
          "I have visited the Lion monument twice before, but never knew about the existence of this glacier garden! Wow, what an interesting place! The actual evidence of glacier activity is fascinating and worth the entrance fee! But, then you continue into the museum, hall of mirrors,",
          "A interesting garden to study about glaciers and the hall of mirrors is a fun place to visit. Climb the tower as well to get a view of lucerne. Plus it is just beside the dying lion monument.",
          "The children appreciated the labyrinth of mirrors that does not match the theme of the museum. Anyway the museum was interesting and well organised",
          "This is a place I have been wanting to visit in Lucerne for some time, but more from a curiosity of what a glacier garden could be! I expected that our stay would be an hour or less but three hours later, we were still exploring it! The garden and the accompanying museum are",
          "When you visit the lion monument, the glacier garden is just next to it. If you have a Swiss Pass, the admission is free. There are many things exhibited in the museum. You can learn about glacier, birds, and more. It was;all to education, for me. From all of the attractions",
          "Take the time to see the Glacier Garden-- the hall of mirrors is a lot of fun. The tower was closed in late November.. But the garden is worth the short walk from old town.",
          "Fascinating outdoor exhibit demonstrating glacial action. It was discovered when a local man was attempting to dig a wine cellar. Luckily he knew what he had happened upon. A \"flying roof\" covers the \"dig\" area.",
          "If you are travelling with a swiss pass, this attraction is FREE to you. If you have time in your tour and are in Lucerne and want to spend an hour or so, you should definitely visit Glacier Garden. Apparently during some excavation they discovered the glacial rock below and are",
          "This is close to the dying lion of Lucerne and well worth the time that you spent here. The whole science around the glaciers is well presented in the adjacent house and makes one just realized how little part we are of the earth's history and sadly just how devastating that",
          "Using are Museum Pass (30Euro for 48 hours) we thought we would nip in and see what this is about. We didnt expect much but actually thoroughly enjoyed it. Both my wife and I found ti really interesting. Also seems quite good for kids with some mini atreactions within (House",
          "this attraction costs 15CHF per person for entry. There are many displays (they number them up to 44). The actual glacier garden area is interesting for a few minutes, then there are many other mini attractions, which we (two adults) found dis interesting, though children may",
          "35FR family entry, pretty well done display of the potholes formed by glacial melt. Good museum covering a variety of topics, something for everyone, well done, multi-lingual displays. The hall of mirrors (not sure what that has to do with anything) was the biggest hit. Good",
          "The track the glacier left in the city is well-marked, outdoors and covered by canvas. Great displays inside, plus a hall of mirrors that is a maze.",
          "Never seen elsewhere...the ground as carved by glaciers! Apart from the penguin models, presumably for kids, it was superb, surreal and facinating.",
          "You get to see Luzern 20 Million years ago and other odd facts about the place. Great with kids too especially the mirror maze.",
          "No visitor to Lucerne should miss a visit to the Glacier Garden! Here, you will encounter lost worlds; there are few places on earth that portray the history of our planet so clearly. The visitor embarks on a voyage of discovery from a subtropical palm beach that existed 20",
          "If you are looking for a fun way to pass an hour or so in Central Lucerne this place is worth a visit - particularly if you have a Swiss Pass, as entry is free then. It's a bit of a mish-mash: a bit about the glacial history of Switzerland, some old relief maps of the area, a",
          "Also the site for Lucerne's weeping lion, the Glacier Garden offers the possibility to learn about Switzerland's glacial past without leaving central Lucerne. All genuine of course!",
          "It will be interesting for both children and adults. For children there are a lot of buttons light up 3-D maps and panoramas, and for adults there is a simple but exciting video-show. And of course, a mirror maze transforms any adult in the child. We didn't pay for this",
          "Do not miss the view from the top of the tower -- it's a hike but so worth it. Best view of Lucerne. This is a strange place with a mixture of things. Cool glacier potholes. Fascinating. The museum throws a lot of things in from global warming issues to a old house to a few",
          "If never been there it is definitely a place you have to visit when in Lucern. The Gletschergarten contains glacier mills.",
          "liked mirror walls, the rocks left by glacier, the artefacts and the explanation about the glaciers, ice, storms, earth etc 3d show was a let down as was the small print and no English on artefacts",
          "Another rainy day activity for my family. The \"garden\" isn't incredibly interesting to kids but as an adult I liked it. The highlight is the mirror maze and the various mirrors around the park. One of the kids favorite activities.",
          "Overall this was reasonably interesting, but it would have been disappointing without the House of Mirrors. The attraction has many parts to it, including the glacial kettles (interesting for about 10 minutes), a movie (super tacky), the house of mirrors (fun for kids and",
          "Gletschergarten is next to the Lion Monument and is well worth a visit. There!s more to see here than just the glacier garden. Included in the entry price is the museum, a 10 minute video on climate and landscape change in Lucerne, Amrein's House which is the former residence",
          "The kids appriciated this place a lot, especially the mirror labyrinth! Well worth a visit and reduced entrance with swiss pass!",
          "Located next to Lucerne Lion Monument. We were alone in museum but we enjoyed is so much the staff had to push us out when they closed. Considered returning for second visit.",
          "Husband and I really enjoyed the Glacier Garden in Lucerne. We visited on a rainy, chilly day in early May. It is right beside the Dying Lion Monument and down the street from the Bourbaki Panorama. We spent about a couple of hours there but it could easily be seen in an hour",
          "There are 90 mirrors inside, you will feel amazing to find the real route inside. It seems that the route is very long, but infect it is very short.",
          "This is most educational utilizing a variety of medium that should appeal to all ages and levels of interests. Great presentations and exhibits!",
          "Some attractions like mirror maze are good. The best part was that it was free for Swiss Pass holders.",
          "Really? Lucerne was once a tropical area? Who would have ever thought? Nice history preserved here and some lovely stones and rocks showing the passing of time.",
          "Located next to the Lion monument. A mixture of attractions and you mightn't want to visit all of them. You don't need to be a student of geology to appreciate the forces of nature. The museum is interesting.",
          "This 'museum' (not sure what to call it) was small but interesting. I learned a lot about Switzerland before the ice age which I would not have known otherwise. There is also a mirror labyrinth here that was pretty fun.",
          "While there were some interesting exhibits at the Glacier Garden, overall it is basically a tourist trap with a lot of random things--cage of bunnies, Alhambran mirror maze (in the middle of Switzerland?), etc. While a lot of the glacier-centric exhibits were geared more to",
          "Even for a layman as myself. Recommend to join a guided tour. Loved the ticket booth built in 1872 and enjoyed the mirror labyrinth. Fun and interesting for the whole family. Staff I met spoke German, English and Norwegian.",
          "It doesn't look like much from the entrance, so we were quite suprised at how indepth it is. The story behind it and the house is very interesting, something for all the family, even a few animals out the back and a cafe for the kids.",
          "I went under duress with my children, to put in time. How wrong I was to think it would be dull. So interesting and, family friendly. The discoveries made and the multimedia presentations are informative and well made. Best on day when you can walk the gardens, climb the tower,",
          "This was an unexpected find. So many different displays and the Mirror room maze was terrific! Be sure to visit every part of the museum including walking up to the top of the tower. This is one of the best non-art museums we have ever visited..of course Churchill's War Room",
          "This is a wonderful way to see glacier remains that was Lucerne millions of years ago. Had lots of fun in mirror maze. Amazing views from the tower. Well worth the time",
          "It was raining in Luzern and not a good day to go up the mountains so we decided to go for this! Free with our Swiss Passes. It's next to the Dying Lion monument. The exhibitions were interesting, especially those about avalanches and glaciers. There are various videos and fun",
          "This is a very informative and enjoyable place. You can spend a good number of hours wondering at the nature's creations. You can see a number of fossils really close, learn the earth displacements and the land formation, the glacier holes and many such geological stuff.",
          "This is a great way to spend and hour or two and learn interesting facts about Lucerne. It is great for all ages and a lot more to see than first meets the eye - certainly great value for your money. There was my self and two sons aged 21 and 17 and both, enjoyed this attraction",
          "Four trips to Luzern in my lifetime and this last one I finally squeezed this delightfully eclectic museum in. I'm a relief map geek, so all of those maps fascinated me. The house itself was enjoyable to explore and the mirror maze was fun. Do climb the tower outside for a",
          "These are really just holes in the ground. They're interesting, however, because of the way they're formed. The exhibits are very informative on this. The glacier gardens are also tied to the mirror hall and the museum as a package, and they're all worth a visit.",
          "A nice site, but 15 Euro to see it is outrageous even by Swiss standards. The glacial pits etc. were interesting, and the viewing tower provided a nice view of part of the area. However, I learned nothing I had not already seen/read on the internet, and had good views of the",
          "This was a surprise. If you are into geology, you can go deep on the information here, but even if not, it's really interesting to gloss over and pick up a little bit here and there. A funny little 10 minute movie that also runs in English, tells you how 20 million years ago",
          "Actually, the Glacier Garden is only of limited interest to me - just some circular holes in the ground. However at the same location is the Lion Monument, the Labyrinth of Mirrors and a museum. Taken all together, definitely worth a visit",
          "If you're in Lucerne, please take your time! Its a wonderful city that you must explore walking.. We had the swiss pass so we didn't have to pay anything which was really nice :) But it is still really nice to explore the glacier and the musuem, even if you're not that into",
          "If you really like geology, I could see how this would be a cool place. My wife and I, however, found it kind of boring. Hall of mirrors was cool. Also enjoyed going up the stairs to the top of the tower for a decent view. Was something to do on a rainy day in Lucerne, but I",
          "There are several exhibitions in this place, but I found them quite boring. The only interesting object in the museum is mirror maze but considering this - price for the entrance ticket is too high 15 chf.",
          "Worth a visit. Quite a large museum with two main buildings, one of which is mostly for the kids with a mirror maze, etc. Also they have extensive outside exhibits to visit. Great place to take the kids or to get a better understanding of how glaciers do what they do.",
          "Although you might be attracted by the name its not the rather bland bit of rock that you should go in for. No its the museum with its historic maps and models detailing the exploration of the Luzern region and beyond to the Alps. Great value, nice caf\u00e9 too",
          "This was very well done! The glacier and geological facts were presented in lay mans terms making it easy for families and those unfamiliar with this subject, enjoy the specialness of the find.",
          "Great little museum showing the geologic history of the region. The garden itself was very interesting.",
          "I so enjoyed this attraction. Learned alot and was able to have fun in the mirror attraction. Loved running up the stairs to the old resturant and being able to see the whole city.",
          "Located next to the dying lion monument, you will need a good hour min to go through the place. Don't worry, you'll love it and it's kids friendly.  Easy to follow all attractions inside as they'll give you a printed leaflet with the order of the attraction to go through.  The",
          "There is a lot more to this than appears from the outside. The natural history is really interesting and a movie show provides more information. We enjoyed the views, and the house and thought the hall of mirrors was great fun. A good value day out in Lucerne.",
          "It was more than I expected and thoroughly enjoyed the museum, garden, tower, and mirror house. We did not expect much after visiting other museums in town but ended up spending over an hour here. Recommend it highly BObK",
          "It was unexpectedly a lot of fun, both to see the holes made by the Glacier, as well as the museum/house and the mirror maze which was fun for adults and kids.",
          "No for me it was not worth it. There is not much to see and the entry fee is way to high for what is on offer.",
          "The Glacier Garden is enjoyable. the original owners of a house were going to dig a wine celler and found the glaceir potholes. You can also venture into the old house, and view various other exhibits. Worth the price - and a good rainy day activity since must of this is",
          "I didn\u2019t visit the whole garden due to time constraints. But I still enjoyed it. It was interesting to know a bit about the geology. It might be very enriching to go through the museum slowly, which I didn\u2019t have time to do. The part I enjoyed the most was the \u201cAlhambra maze\u201d.",
          "On the outside, it doesn't look as appealing to tourists. But because we had done some research on the Internet and know there was much to see, we venture in. We showed our full Swiss pass, and surprise! It was free admission! The front part was nothing much, but as e ventured",
          "From first look, it seemed nothing so much to see around but there is a lot of sections inside, including geo world, ice story, history of swiss, fossil, variety of trouts and local plant, mirror house and of course, glacier. We do love the hall of mirror, very good and nice to",
          "The Glacier Garden offers different attractions: excavations, glasier museum offering interesting exhibition and the million year show, Amrein's house, \"Alhambra\" mirror Maze - a must to see attraction, and a path to the observation tower.",
          "Very informative and educational for whole family. The hall of mirrors is good fun Free with Swiss pass",
          "I had been to Gletschergarten many years ago, and I remembered the visit as relatively short, we then presented at the entrance one hour before closing. The lady at the ticket office has warned us that one hour was insufficient time, and graciously admitted us at half price.",
          "This is a great Museum for all the family. We spent nearly two hours here. Lots of children were really having a fun time in the hall of mirrors. Really good value for money",
          "The Glacier Garden is a short walk up from the Lion Monument. If you've got a Swiss pass, its free entry, other wise its 12CHF for adults. The exhibits are pretty cool. There's a big model of Lucerne and of the mountains of Switzerland. Make sure you climb the tower. Awesome",
          "If you like the geology than don't miss it.I recommend you go to the Tower , because very nice the view of the city.Look at yourself in the very funny mirrors :-)",
          "Amazing place - from the archeological interest near the entrance to the Victorian mirror hall. Don't miss this!!!",
          "The Glacier Garden in Lucerne, adjacent to the Lion Monument, was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. There is, of course, the garden itself which is fascinating. All of the material and signposts are in English which was great. There's an informative glacier exhibit,",
          "If you are interested in anything like this, then it is worth a visit. Very informative about how the glaciers form etc.",
          "I thought this would be just another tourist haunt but I was pleasantly surprised. The interpretive boards and other information provided was interesting. And for a bit of fun, get lost in the mirror room! From the walkway, you get an amazing view of the sleeping lion too!",
          "With our Swiss Pass entry was free but it would have been worth paying full whack to see the extraordinary preserved glacial garden, to learn about the history of the house and all the other aspects of the museum and to have a great laugh in the hall of mirrors. Thoroughly",
          "I was recommended the Glacier garden by many collegaues from Switzerland who asked me not to miss it at any cost. The glacier garden is close to the railway station, but was a little tough to find. The museum is just too good. The garden which has remaants of what the glacier",

        "wiki": "A panorama (formed from Greek \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd \"all\" + \u1f45\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 \"sight\") is any wide-angle view or representation of a physical space, whether in painting, drawing, photography, film, seismic images or a three-dimensional model.  The word was originally coined in the 18th century by the English (Irish descent) painter Robert Barker to describe his panoramic paintings of Edinburgh and London. The motion-picture term panning is derived from panorama.A panoramic view is also purposed for multimedia, cross-scale applications to an outline overview (from a distance) along and across repositories. This so-called \"cognitive panorama\" is a panoramic view over, and a combination of, cognitive spaces used to capture the larger scale.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe device of the panorama existed in painting, particularly in murals, as early as 20 A.D., in those found in Pompeii, as a means of generating an immersive \"panoptic\" experience of a vista.\nCartographic experiments during the Enlightenment era preceded European panorama painting and contributed  to a formative impulse toward panoramic vision and depiction.\nThis novel perspective was quickly conveyed to America by Benjamin Franklin who was present for the first manned balloon flight by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783, and by the American-born physician, John Jeffries who had joined French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard on flights over England and the first aerial crossing of the English Channel in 1785.\n\n\n== As popular spectacle ==\nIn the mid-19th century, panoramic paintings and models became a very popular way to represent landscapes, topographic views and historical events. Audiences of Europe in this period were thrilled by the aspect of illusion, immersed in a winding 360 degree panorama and given the impression of standing in a new environment. The panorama was a 360-degree visual medium patented under the title Apparatus for Exhibiting Pictures by the artist Robert Barker in 1787. The earliest that the word \"panorama\" appeared in print was on June 11, 1791 in the British newspaper The Morning Chronicle, referring to this visual spectacle. Barker created a painting, shown on a cylindrical surface and viewed from the inside, giving viewers a vantage point encompassing the entire circle of the horizon, rendering the original scene with high fidelity. The inaugural exhibition, a \"View of Edinburgh\", was first shown in that city in 1788, then transported to London in 1789. By 1793, Barker had built \"The Panorama\" rotunda at the center of London's entertainment district in Leicester Square, where it remained attracting visitors for 70 years, then closing in 1863.\nInventor Sir Francis Ronalds developed a machine to remove errors in perspective that were created when a sequence of planar sketches was combined into a cylinder. It also projected the cylindrical drawing onto the wall of the rotunda at much larger scale to enable its accurate painting. The apparatus was exhibited at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.\nLarge scale installations enhance the illusion for an audience of being surrounded with a real landscape. The Bourbaki Panorama in Lucerne, Switzerland was created by Edouard Castres in 1881. The painting measures about 10 metres in height with a circumference of 112 meters. In the same year of 1881, the Dutch marine painter Hendrik Willem Mesdag created and established the Panorama Mesdag of The Hague, Netherlands, a cylindrical painting more than 14 metres high and roughly 40 meters in diameter (120 meters in circumference). In the United States of America is the Atlanta Cyclorama, depicting the Civil War Battle of Atlanta. It was first displayed in 1887, and is 42 feet high by 358 feet circumference (13 x 109 metres). Also on a gigantic scale, and still extant, is the Rac\u0142awice Panorama (1893) located in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland, which measures 15 x 120 metres. In addition to these historical examples, there have been panoramas painted and installed in modern times; prominent among these is the Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles, California (2004).\n\n\n== Photographs ==\n\nPanoramic photography soon came to displace painting as the most common method for creating wide views. Not long after the introduction of the Daguerreotype in 1839, photographers began assembling multiple images of a view into a single wide image. In the late 19th century, flexible film enabled the construction of panoramic cameras using curved film holders and clockwork drives to rotate the lens in an arc and thus scan an image encompassing almost 180 degrees.\n\nPinhole cameras of a variety of constructions can be used to make panoramic images. A popular design is the \"oatmeal box\", a vertical cylindrical container in which the pinhole is made in one side and the film or photographic paper is wrapped around the inside wall opposite, and extending almost right to the edge of, the pinhole. This generates an egg-shaped image with more than 180\u00b0 view.Popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but now superseded by digital presentation software, Multi-image (also known as multi-image slide presentations, slide shows or diaporamas) 35mm slide projections onto one or more screens characteristically lent themselves to the wide screen panorama. They could run autonomously with silent synchronization pulses to control projector advance and fades, recorded beside an audio voice-over or music track. Precisely overlapping slides placed in slide mounts with soft-edge density masks would merge seamlessly on the screen to create the panorama. Cutting and dissolving between sequential images generated animation effects in the panorama format.\n\n\n=== VR photographs ===\n\nDigital photography of the late twentieth century greatly simplified this assembly process, which is now known as image stitching. Such stitched images may even be fashioned into forms of virtual reality movies, using technologies such as Apple Inc.'s QuickTime VR, Flash, Java, or even JavaScript. A rotating line camera such as the Panoscan allows the capture of high resolution panoramic images and eliminates the need for image stitching, but immersive \"spherical\" panorama movies (that incorporate a full 180\u00b0 vertical viewing angle as well as 360\u00b0 around) must be made by stitching multiple images. Stitching images together can be used to create extremely high resolution gigapixel panoramic images.\n\n\n== Motion picture ==\n\nOn rare occasions, 360\u00b0 panoramic movies have been constructed for specially designed display spaces\u2014typically at theme parks, world's fairs, and museums. Starting in 1955, Disney has created 360\u00b0 theaters for its parks and the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne, Switzerland, features a theatre that is a large cylindrical space with an arrangement of screens whose bottom is several metres above the floor. Panoramic systems that are less than 360\u00b0 around also exist. For example, Cinerama used a very wide curved screen, with three synchronized projectors, and IMAX Dome / OMNIMAX movies are projected on a dome above the spectators.\n\n\n== Non-photographic representations ==\nPanoramic representation can be generated from digital elevation models such as SRTM. In these diagrams, a panorama from any given point can be generated and imaged from the data.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComparison of photo stitching software\nCyclorama\nDiorama\nEveryScape\nGoogle Street View\nInternational Panorama Council\nLeme panoramic camera\nMoving panorama\nMulti-image\nOmnidirectional camera\nPanoramic painting\nPanoramic photography\nPanoramic tripod head\nRoute panorama\nWidescreen\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAltick, Richard (1978).

          "We bought the Lucerne Museum Pass (36CHF for access to 8 museums) at the ticket desk from a very helpful receptionist. The entrance price included use of an iPad with detailed commentary and background information on the panorama depicting the internment of the French army. The",
          "A lifelike and mind boggling painting of horses, soldiers and civilians with an interesting war story is the centrepiece of attraction, though there is a lovely cafe and ongoing exhibitions. It is a place one can spend hours .",
          "Ingenious to have a circular painting inside a round building! Great story depicting scenes from the French-Prussian War of 1870/71 when the French Army under General Bourbaki crossed into Switzerland. The painter Edourd Castres even painted himself into a scene, wow!!!",
          "Bourbaki Panorama is on the way of the Lion Monument and it is a museum for those who are interested in knowing the history and the spirit of Switzerland. I have spent one full hour there, there is a lot to read, listen and you are given for free an iPad that gives you a lot of",
          "We took a day trip to Lucerne with visitors and my quick review of things to see and do didn't even list the Bourbaki Panorama. Which is a pity because we would have missed it had we not seen the building in our quest to visit the SUVA building tower. I suggest you add it to",
          "This is a fantastic way to find out about the French soldiers fleeing into Switzerland in 1871. Not just a great painting but a terrific detailed panaorama that you become immersed into. And you can get a photo at the end of it! Really well worth the hour or so to look at",
          "In a month\u2019s holiday in Europe this is close to being one of this most stimulating sight I saw. How could you fail to wonder at the sight of this 110 metre long, 10 metre wide circular panorama that dramatically depicting a vast scene from the 19th Century Franco-Prussian War.",
          "Really went because part of a pass from Glacier Park. Absolutely stunning art work and highly educational. Ended up spending an hour there. Do not miss this Exhibit.",
          "My wife thought this was one of the two man-made wonders we have seen in our travels. We were totally engrossed in the experience. The exhibit is so well presented, with background sound effects for each area if the painting and a very good included narration on an iPad with",
          "although we live in world of 3D and augmented reality this painting is still beautiful and impressive . The museum is well kept and the audio guide was great it was more of an app . The price is expensive if you don't plan on going to Glacier Garden as well .",
          "I personally enjoyed this the most of the three sites all bunched together. Free if you have the Swiss pass and it last maybe 30 minutes. Really like the second floor where the story is told and the visual affects. Worth a visit",
          "This was included in our Swiss Travel Pass so we went in. It was worth it. The painting is very good and detailed but what brings it to life is the narration you hear (on the surround sound PA system). it was in English when we were there. Told the whole story behind the",
          "I do not consider myself a fan of an artwork but this place blew my mind. I almost missed it as I had kept it at the end in my list of places to visit but I am so happy that I was able to make it. We spend 40-45 minutes here and it was memorable. There was a short film on the",
          "I must admit that, had I to decide on one museum to skip, this would have been it. It just wasn't that interesting to me. It was a big circular painting of a wartime scene with no explanation. (The was supposed to be an English recording playing when I went in, but they never",
          "This is a single panoramic painting (supplemented by some artifacts and figures) depicting the Swiss people's aide of the French army escaping from the Prussian army and the beginning of the Red Cross. We learned a lot, and the painting is nicely done.",
          "Fabulous panoramic painting of a key historical event tying in the Red Cross beginnings with Switzerland's attitude to refugees.",
          "Rick recommends asking at the front desk when the English version of the soundtrack starts. It was five minutes when we arrived. The painting by E. Castres is a dramatic masterpiece. Fascinating story of how the Swiss people helped the retreating French soldiers. Check out the",
          "During the war time Swiss had a huge setback which was commissioned to be painted by General Bourbaki as a panorama. It\u2019s a paid art view in a circular room in a commercial building, it\u2019s paid one and it has a short video of 10 mins too which is done in different languages.",
          "The original realist masterpiece of a painting wraps the interior of its circular home in the heart of the 19th century section of Luzern, very close to the Old Swiss House Restaurant. The painting depicts the end of a war between French and Prussian troops, where the Swiss",

          "Had seen panorama painting before but this one was one step higher, with the exhibition and then the painting with sound and effects. Very interesting.",
          "A unique concept, given the circular shape of the structure & located in a central part of the city, Bourbaki Panorama lures you with its richness & attractiveness!",
          "I try and visit well-known art whenever we travel, and this is unlike anything I've ever seen. Depicting the French army's retreat during the end of the Franco-Prussian War (in which 87,000 injured, ill and starving soldiers & refugees were systematically accepted and tended by",
          "Interactive unique attraction with free ipad rental to better explain the painting and make the visit interactive.",
          "A remarkable undertaking, but it's a bit unusual to be the sole feature of a museum. The presentation has been enhanced with sounds and narration, and some of the artwork is not painted, but is material reproduced in the foreground. The video presentation on the lower floor",
          "Before visiting this place, I had no idea what panoramas were, as an art form. It is rather deceptively located and since most people's first choice is to visit the L\u00f6wendenkmal (Lion Monument) just up the street, it can be easily missed. But once inside, the enthralling",
          "This was a very impressive piece of art and a very nice memorial/monument to the soldiers of the war, but it wasn't really my style. We only went because the Swiss Pass made it free and it was hailed as a must-see in Lucerne. Would agree that if you have time or are going to",
          "Stumbled upon this exhibit with my mom as we were touring Luzern. It was included in the Swiss Travel pass, so it was free for us! Otherwise it's about 12 francs. It has 2 floors - one where you see an exhibit that has a panoramic view of the Franco-Prussian war and General",
          "The Bourbaki Panorama is an enormous circular painting depicting a historic event during the Franco-Prussian War. We went in because the admission is free with Swiss travel pass. This place makes a good stop to get shelter from the rain. Otherwise, there is really not much",
          "This panorama is a piece of history which should be seen, not only for the historical display but also the concept of a panorama. Was included in our city museum pass. The small flea market at the base level had some interesting artisans as a bonus.",
          "My wife and I visited this museum because it was included free with our Swiss travel pass. I'm glad we decided to check it out. The panorama is amazing. It also gives you a wonderful historical perspective of the country you are visiting. Recommended if you have the time.",
          "I like art and have seen Cyclorama in Atlanta GA (burning of Atlanta) this is expensive but I felt worth the ecperience especially with movie",
          "At first we just went in there to get out of the rain. However, this is amazing and well worth a visit. The panorama is beautiful and has been painted with so much love for detail that you can spend a long time looking at the different scenes. The exhibition on the floor below",
          "Very well done and interesting. Being from the U.S. A, I am not that knowledgeable about this particular war. The panorama is beautiful and the movie is good. Learned a lot just reading the different information panels. Covered by the Swiss travel pass.",
          "We were visiting the Dying Lion and this is nearby, oddly wrapped in a circular commercial/library building. Search inside and you will find the entrance. It is a large 1881 circular painting commemorating a battle in the Franco-Prussian War. It is very similar in design to the",
          "We arrived 30 minutes before closing, and the information lady was very friendly. She recommended that we take the audio headset and go to the top floor where the panorama is. It was perfect!",
          "This is a panorama view of the culture of the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 when over 80,000 French soldiers surrender and were offered asylum in Switzerland! It was very moving! Cost is $12CHF per adult or purchase the suggest get the Museum Pass for $36CHF that you can use",
          "This attraction is a 360-degree painting an actual piece of Swiss history. It depicts French troops surrendering to the Swiss army after they were defeated by the Germans in 1871. The Swiss exhibit compassion to the French, and do everything they can to assist the French to",
          "we took a lot of time here enjoying this. we took our time and learned so much about this time in history. don't rush through - it is worth really reading the information and studying the painting. well done. we loved it!",
          "Beyond the artistic value of the Bourbaki Panorama, which has now gained in threedimensionality, the place has a touching feel to it. In this day and age where everyone cares only about their own business and material gain, this is a reminder that solidarity in the face of",
          "This place takes your breath away. It is staggering, a 100 metres portrait of a French army in retreat (90,000) which the Swiss looked after for 6 weeks. Yes it portrays the Swiss compassion and their love of money receiving a large sum from the French for the 100,000 + arms",
          "I really surprised at how good this was. There are models and props in the foreground, that just dissolve into the painting. You can see it all from the top floor looking down at the models and across at the painting; and downstairs, you are at the same level as the models",
          "We had previously visited the Atlanta Cyclorama, one of the few other surviving historic panorama paintings. So we weren't expecting the Bourbaki Panorama to be more than mildly interesting. We were pleasantly surprised to find it fascinating! For one thing, the viewer's",
          "It is a pity the original structure is hidden behing an ugly grey modern structure. Also, the lady at the counter told us she would play the tape in our language but it never came through. If you are short in time, you easily skip the first floor. Apart from all that, a visit",
          "We only stuck our heads in because it was free...would have been mad to pay for this. I get the history behind it, but it was nothing more than a giant winter scene. Don't bother, look up the story online and save your Euro.",
          "WE are not museum folks, but with rainy, snowy skies, we purchased the Lucerne Museum Pass and went to this museum because it was included. We watched the introduction film then went on to see the 360 panorama painting. We were fascinated by the 4 D effect as sound was added to",
          "If you like history, you will love this attraction, which tells the story of the internment of French soldiers during the war of 1870-1. The panorama itself is impressive, and the multimedia explanatory material is very well-done, with the stories of participants of the events",
          "Many times my wife and I went to something with a speaker/announcer or a recording and it was in a foreign language. After getting our free tickets using our Swiss Pass the woman at the desk explained to us that when the German recording ends within the next 10 minutes, it will",
          "We entered the Bourbaki panorama not quite knowing what to expect but actually encountered a moving 3D 360 degrees panorama of the 1871 surrender of General Bourbaki\u2019s French army of 87,000 to the Swiss during the Franco Prussian war. They were on their last legs and were dying.",
          "My golly, it was in foreign language ! you sit there in front of a round screen that doesnt change and the kids were bored. It was saying something very interesting, but if its in a foreign language, kids cant understand.",
          "We popped in here more or less by mistake. It is the cinema and library in town. The surprise was the bar area that did snacks and drinks. Good, helpful staff and if you just want a sandwich and a drink, this is the place.",
          "We were very impressed with this Panorama. The painting is awesome and the audio visual helped to understand what the Panorama is all about. Well worth a visit.",
          "We didn't know about this until I saw it in a brochure. We watched the video about the painting, then proceeded upstairs to see the 360 degree painting. Amazing when this was done and it's in 3D. Take your time here.",
          "This is an amazing 360 degree painting and diorama by Edouard Castres depicting a memorable event of the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71) when Frances\u2018s Eastern Army crossed the Swiss border and surrendered seeking protection from the Swiss. This medium of a panorama design was",
          "A huge round oilpainting leads you back into nostalgic historical times of Switzerland - showing humanity to suffering people - an old tradition of neutral Switzerland - impressive!",
          "Visually stunning, admission is 12CHF per adult and worth the expense. The visit starts with an audio visual guide followed by viewing the artwork itself. The pairing is huge.",
          "only reason to visit is because it is next door to Luzern's iconic lion monument. It is interesting, more for its design than wgat is portrayed. Panorama turn out to be life size models of train wagons,soldiers, horses etc representing retreating French army in 19th century that",
          "Interesting, but if you're not a student of this period it doesn't really grab your attention. However; if you do go, spend some time to study the dioramas in the foreground. There are lots of details that do lend authenticity to the painting.",
          "Not many people know about the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71. One of the famous stories to come out at that time was Switzerland\u2019s humanitarian act of providing refuge for General Bourbaki\u2019s French Army from being captured by the Prussians. The Swiss and French are proud of",
          "On a rainy day during our time in Lucerne we visited the Bourbaki Panorama. The museum is very well presented and the panorama itself is incredible. A very interesting way to find out about the Franco-German war. Only criticism is that it was a little expensive but we still felt",
          "Never seen an artwork which is drawn panoramically and in 360 degrees. And with a couple of nifty tricks, they turned it into an almost 3D experience. Try to identify the artist who drew himself into the picture. This you would only know if you sat through the interactive video",
          "The panorama of the French army of general Bourbaki, coming in internment in winter thought the Swiss Jura, after the lost war between France and Germany is already long forgotten. But this panorama shows in an impressive way the horrible effects of war on people, in particular",
          "This museum is part of the City Museum Pass, it is interesting, all based on an indecent that occurred over a couple month period. The museum is very well done and very professional, there are plenty of places to sit as it is mainly a video and large wall displays.",
          "This place is also a movie theater at night, but kind of interesting. The panorama is very large and well done. I didn't know the Swiss held all the French weapons until they got paid for interning their soldiers during the Franco-Prussian war.",
          "The building is near the Lion Monument. It has the Bourbaki Panorama, cinemas, a good coffee, large clean restrooms. One can very well rest here with a cup of tea and learn a little about the history of Switzerland.",
          "I have a big respect to history and l am fond of history but this place didnt give me what l wanted. \u0130t is decorated well and my understanding of panorama museum is ok but there should be more information given and the entrance fee is quite expensive.",
          "If you've already seen the Lion and the walls and like humongous art displays about military history, check this out. It really is very interesting. Not just the 360*, 3D panorama, but the artifacts and the history also. There are winding stairs, not very long but I'm not",
          "I got into this site for free because of my Swiss Pass, and honestly don't pay to see it. The panorama itself is interesting as one of the first mass media experiences (like Imax for the early 1900s), and the battle scene it depicts is tragic. However, as I said, don't make a",
          "Went here on the recommendation of a Swiss colleague and it became the highlight of our Luzern visit (which is otherwise a scenic pretty little town). My mother (74) and I really enjoyed this place for a few reasons: a) the events depicted are historically interesting, when",
          "It's a panaroma painting. I really find it amazing how did they paint this! Really great effort. There's multimedia show too. But do ask about English version at the counter. The lady had to stop playing the English version as she has a guided tour booking in another language.",
          "This 360 degrees mixed media presentation of an obscure moment of the 1870 French/German war is surprising, interesting and very well done with the audio part giving you a poetic explanation of the event. We arrived there 15 min before closing time, but the lady at the ticket",
          "This is almost next door to the lion sculpture, so it's easy to do both of these in one visit. What an amazing experience, we were fortunate to have the entire exhibit to ourselves and could wait for the English interpretation to play. If you can, spend the time sitting and",
          "We bought a Luzern museum pass and this was one of the places to see. We didn't know anything about the Bourbaki part of Swiss history, and were amazed at both the mural and the presentation. We learnt a lot. A really surprising museum. Well worth the visit.",
          "A very moving and informative exhibit. You're basically inside a 360 degree panorama painting, supplemented by lifesize dioramas in the foreground to make it even more realistic. The subject matter is a moving testament to the misery and tragedy of war. One of the better",
          "The paintings are very good but our experience was dreadful! A group of Italians was before us so after collecting our money we were told to spend 15 minutes in the museum which we did. We then went up to the panorama. We waited another 15 minutes for the Italian to finish only",
          "An unusual survival from what was once a popular form of proto-multimedia entertainment, depicting the surrender of defeated French troops on the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 in neutral Swizerland.",
          "We wouldn't have gone in here except for being with locals who were guiding us. It gave us a great sense of understanding of the Red Cross and the legacy of this event on modern mankind.",
          "Although it's near the Lion Monument and other heavily touristed sites, the Bourbaki is often mercifully quiet. The painting at the top is really something special and much more impressive than I'd originally thought. Good bar on the ground floor. The building also houses an",
          "In 1871, the Prussians repelled the French army at Belfort and pushed them back over the Swiss border, where they were disarmed and interned. In 1881, Castres painted a huge panorama of the beaten army, supported by a team of artists which included Hodler. This panorama is now",
          "So I\u2019ve always been a bit confused about Prussia. I remember it from my Western Civ classes, but it\u2019s not something your average American can tell you much about. Is it pre-Germany Germany? Is it Russia (sounds like Russia)? Is it Poland? Sure looks like it on the map - did",
          "Although the painting itself is impressive there is not much else going on. There is a narration in different languages however there is nothing to indicate which section of the picture the narration relates to. This could be so much better.",
          "Amazing painting. How they manage to give that 3D effect even for \"distant\" objects, I could not figure out. And they have physical dioramas in the foreground that blend seamlessly into the painting. You can zoom through in 15 minutes, or take 3 hours to pore over every nook",
          "Included in a Swiss Pass; This is pretty neat about Swiss giving 87,000+ French soldiers sanctuary after Prussia's defeat of France.....& then they sent France a bill; very humanitarian and early involvement of the Red Cross. Don't get frustration just looking, wait for the",

          "I was in Lucerne with my daughter who lives not far from Lucerne and we walked past this and I said we should go and look even though she didn't know about it. What a surprise. A very enlightening and educational experience. I had no idea about the internment of the French army",
          "Given that this was painted in 1881 it tells an amazing story that makes you reflect on the true humanity that can be found during wars - albeit in a different time than today!",
          "...but one visit is probably enough and you can combine that with a good visit at the cinema. Also the bar inside is really a strange place and I always wonder why it is so crowded.",

          "Sure, It's a nice 360\u00b0 painting depicting an epic battle, but the price (10CHF for student, 12CHF for adults) is way high just for watching the painting. Do it if you have spare money.",
          "The Museum was showing the movie of bourbanki regiment of france . The show was good but not worth that much price .",
          "Top entertainment from a bygone era brought back to life in Lucerne. Unique piece of historic entertainment, excellent venue for this treasure, and a great way to spend 30 low-key minutes if you have the Swiss pass.",
          "The bourbaki was once the oldest car park house in the world. There's a huge wooden plate turning on the floor as the car's were not able to park. Downstairs there is an alternative cinema with good european movies and upstairs there's the panorama painting which is really worth",
          "We visited this venue to see an historical event of the past. Very interesting video explains how and when this event took place and 87000 French soldiers were admitted into Switzerland! Written comments available in German, French, Italian and English. On the upper floor you",
          "This is a fascinating panorama, well executed, great detail, the paint looks fresh and almost new. While its essentially a one painting show, it is so unusual to have this well preserved a panorama, that I found it well worth the effort. i think about 20 minutes is a fair amount",
          "Watch the show on the second floor first to get the background history about the meaning of the Panorama first. Afterwards, head upstairs and spend some time looking at the entire painting. The sheer size of it is impressive and the history that it tells is quite interesting.",
          "Husband and I so enjoyed the Bourbaki Panorama and glad we made time for it while in Lucerne. Beautiful 360 degree panoramic art and a glimpse into Swiss history with 3D figures in places to make it come to life was so interesting and entertaining for us. It is well worth a",
          "I have seen the panorama a number of times the last was a teachers' Christmas meal which always has culture to start with! The panorama is quite unique. A circular painting which goes 360 degrees and tries to tease you into thinking that you are standing in the centre of a",
          "It's hard to appreciate something like this in today's age, where technology has enabled so much more. The panorama depicts a snowy scene of trudging troops, which is very moving by itself. However, that's about it. A 360 degree painting. Though worth a visit, it isn't quite as",
          "I've only been here once for a few drinks, but there was a nice atmosphere in the way that there were all sorts of different groups of people chatting away in many different languages - great if your a people watcher and like to be immersed in the culture of Lucerne. There is a",
          "Its hidden above the library and whilst the video presentation and the panorama itself is excellent there isn't really anything to put it into a proper context. Why were these troops interned? what conflict were they involved in? Could do better.",
          "Never seen anything like it before, truly amazing. Well worth a visit and a must if you are interested in art. Only criticism is that I don't think it is that well advertised.",
          "Before visiting this exhibit, we were unaware of this episode in history. The Swiss people showed extraordinary compassion to the French troops, and this panorama is a memorable tribute. It can be visited in less than an hour, and ties in nicely with the nearby Dying Lion",
          "It's great that the Swiss have elevated such a scene that underlines the horror of war and the compassion of mankind; rather than pumping up a classic nationalist scene. Felt sorry for General Bourbaki too.",
          "The Bourbaki Panorama is a remnant of a by-gone era. It is the first questioning of the boundaries between art and reality. it's worth a visit as a historical monument and as a work of art.",
          "Go here to see the huge wrap around painting at the top. Brilliant and way better than we expected with 3D figures and loads of information on a historic moment in Swiss history and the formation of the red cross.",
          "If you are interested in history and art you will find this quite fascinating. One piece of practical advice. You will need a token if you want to use the toilets!!",
          "This touristy attraction is still very interesting. It represents the arrival of soldier-refugees in Switzerland.",
          "It's not a museum \"in the normal wise\", but a huge round pinting, looks really reale with the special foregrounds. It remember the internment of a French Army under their General Bourbaki in winter during WW I (pressed of the Prussian Army against the Swiss Border). It's a fiew",

          "It was a bit difficult to find the way because there was a big watch shop in the building and the ground floor of the museum is indeed a cafe. I thought I went to the wrong place. The place was very interesting. It was a very special and creative way to show tell the story of",

          "Went in and come out in less than 10min. There is practically nothing to see! Just a few wax people and painting of war scene. If you are really interested in history..... no, i still don't recommend the place. Glacier Garden is much much worth it.",

        "wiki": "The Church of St. Leodegar (German: St. Leodegar im Hof or Hofkirche St. Leodegar) is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. It was built in parts from 1633 to 1639 on the foundation of the Roman basilica which had burnt in 1633. This church was one of the few built north of the Alps during the Thirty Years War and one of the largest art history rich churches of the German late renaissance period.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 8th century there was already an abbey consecrated to Saint Maurice on the current site of the church, which had been donated by Pepin the Short, and was known at the time as the Monastarium Luciaria. By the 12th century the abbey was under the jurisdiction of the Murbach Abbey, whose patron saint was St. Leodegar.\nIn 1291 the abbey was sold to the Habsburgs. In 1433 the city of Lucerne, no longer a member of the Eidgenossenschaft, took control of the abbey, and in 1455 it was converted from Benedictine to a \u201cuniversal order\u201d church.\nThe monastery experienced a heyday during the time of the reformation due to Luzern being a prominent city for the Swiss Catholic cantons. The papal nuncio, resident in Luzern, used the church as his cathedral during this time.\nIn 1874 the parish church of St. Leodegar was founded and with that the church became simultaneously a monastery church and parish church, as it is today.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLothar Emmanuel Kaiser: St. Leodegar im Hof, 2003, ISBN 3-89870-132-8",

        "wiki": "The Spreuer Bridge (German: Spreuerbr\u00fccke, formerly also M\u00fchlenbr\u00fccke) is one of two extant covered wooden footbridges in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. Besides the other preserved bridge, the Kapellbr\u00fccke, a third bridge of this type \u2013 the Hofbr\u00fccke \u2013 existed in Lucerne, but was demolished in the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first bridge was constructed in the 13th century to connect the M\u00fchlenplatz (Mill Place) on the right bank of the Reuss with the mills in the middle of the river. The extension of the bridge to the left bank was completed only in c. 1408. This was the only bridge in Lucerne where it was allowed to dump chaff (in German: Spreu, therefore the name Spreuerbr\u00fccke) and leaves into the river, as it was the bridge farthest downriver. The bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1566 and then rebuilt, together with a granary as the bridge head, called the Herrenkeller.\n\n\n== Totentanz ==\nThe pediments of the Spreuer Bridge contain paintings in the interior triangular frames, which is a feature unique to the wooden bridges of Lucerne. In the case of the Spreuer Bridge, the paintings form a Danse Macabre, known as Totentanz in German, which was created from 1616 to 1637 under the direction of painter Kaspar Meglinger. It is the largest known example of a Totentanz cycle. Of the 67 original paintings, 45 are still in existence. Most of the paintings contain the coat of arms of the donor in the lower left corner and to the right the coat of arms of the donor's wife. The black wooden frames bear explanations in verse and the names of the donors. The paintings also contain portraits of the donors and other exponents of Lucerne society. The painters of Lucerne knew the woodcuts by Hans Holbein the Younger but were more advanced in their painting technique. The images and texts of the Lucerne Danse Macabre are intended to highlight that there's no place in the city, in the country or at sea where death isn't present.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJosef Br\u00fclisauer et al.: Die Spreuerbr\u00fccke in Luzern.

          "This bridge is not as long as the Chapel Bridge, but it has the same look and the same architectural value. It is nice to use it to cross from one side of the lake to the other, but it is not that centrally located.",
          "This was the second of the old bridges and it is certainly worth using. However, it is best to allocate time to see it properly as there are amazing paintings on it. It is also worth taking some time to look at the weir by the turbine station at one end, as you can appreciate",
          "This is my second trip to the bridge. As before, it was crowded and easily bypassed for that reason, but don't. Many of the bridge arches, originally all, before being damaged by fire, are crowned with triangular paintings. One in each direction. Originally 100+ scenes, of",
          "I've been to Luzern (Lucerne) probably a dozen times, and we always walk the famous Chapel Bridge. Since the Spreuer Bridge was not burned down and rebuilt, I find it to be more interesting, architecturally. If you like to walk, make this part of the tour.",
          "Linda and I walked this bridge on a number of occasions while in Lucerne. It was like stepping into the past, as we pasted the paintings overhead. A lot of them were hard to see, and did not mean much to me as we did not have a guide to tell us about each of them.",
          "Take time to look at the paintings along the bridge as they tell a long story about the history of Lucerne.",

          "There are 2 covered bridges here, and the most famous is the Chapel bridge. This is the other one, but also worth a visit. It has some interesting features such as a small Chapel on the bridge itself. The pictures are quite exceptional.",

          "The wood craftsmanship is truly remarkable considering the age of the bridge. The murals in the beams are well preserved but I did not have a guide sheet to understand their meanings. Well worth the walk",
          "The Spreuer Bridge is one of two extremely old covered wooden bridges in Lucerne. The Spreuer Bridge is located down river from the Chapel Bridge but it is only a very short walk to get to it. The original Spreuer Bridge was built in the 1300's which reached from the right bank",

          "Different from the Kapelle bridge - but this too is a beautiful wooden bridge from centuries ago. The artistic panels were done by kids when we were there - which was still fun to look at, but this also gave a great view of Lucerne across the river. Do make it a point to head",
          "One of the nice things about the Spreuer bridge is that it is less visited by day-trippers and the River Reuss is more dramatic here (than at the Chapel Bridge) due to its proximity to the river dam and the rushing water. The low light at times makes it difficult to study the",

          "Unlike the Chapel Bridge, which burned and destroyed most of its paintings, this bridge still has wonderful stories told in its rafters. We walked here off tour on our own and it was well worth the few minutes. It is easy to get to, and you can see other interesting things along",
          "This is another beautiful, old bridge that is a must see. The paintings are amazing and when you think about how old it is it truly makes you stop and think,",
          "Although it may be less popular than the Chapel Bridge, this one is fully original and well worth crossing to take in all the original murals along the way!",
          "Beautiful experience on the bridge. Beautifully depicted history with beautiful flowers. Too many beautifuls I know but that's what the actual feeling is......",
          "The bridge is fairly unique. There\u2019s some art in the arches and a tiny chapel. I haven\u2019t seen anything like it before.",
          "It's farther down the River Reuss than the Chapel Bridge - why not cross it and then come back to the other side via the Chapel Bridge? It has the same kind of artwork as the Chapel Bridge - but note that this bridge is essentially older and more original than the Chapel Bridge.",
          "Still in the historic district, and well worth a walk as part of a circular stroll. The paintings are quite fine, though a good guide book with explanations is essential if you don't speak German. I thought it really gave insight into the late medieval mind of those who lived",
          "This is the small brother of Chapel Bridge, it is a wooden bridge, too. It has beautiful paintings, and I think it should be visited more, as part of the 0old town and history of Lucerne, it's as beautiful as the Chapel Bridge",
          "Blown away as to how old this structure is. A lesser known structure compared to Chapel Bridge but worth visiting nevertheless. You can combine a visit to this place with having a meal at one of the many cafes that are situated by the water here",
          "The Spreuerbrucke, also known as the Mill Bridge, is an original wooden bridge with 17th century paintings [and its own chapel] that spans the Reuss River",
          "We visited this bridge on our walking tour and although its less famous than Chapel Bridge, its still no less significant in the city. The Spreuer Bridge was built in 1408 and has 67 paintings dating from 1626 to 1635 representing the \"Dance of Death\u201d. Death makes no difference",
          "To think the people in Lucerne make these historic paintings available to the public on a daily basis as you walk the bridge is gift. The Swiss share their heritage for all to see",
          "If you do the Chapel bridge, then of course you'll want to take this bridge to cross back over the river. It's not as long or as nice, but still very beautiful.",
          "There is so much to see in town. Make sure to enjoy the paintings and history behind this structure. Amazing the paintings are still in great shape!",
          "While this bridge is less impressive of the two looking from a distance, it is the more impressive to walk across. Make sure you look up when you are walking across to see the pannels,",

          "One of the two old wooden bridges in Luzern. This one is the smaller of the two and features painted panels focused on death. It is just beyond a small damn where there is ample seating. there is also a square off one end with many cafes. It is very interesting to look at the",

          "Unlike the better-known Chapel Bridge, the Spreuer Bridge, further down the river, holds scenes showing Death interacting with human beings throughout history. The bridge is usually less busy so there's more opportunity to take your time and enjoy the details. It is possible to",
          "This is another beautiful wooden bridge across the river. It is not as long or adorned as the Chapel Bridge, but it is still amazing, and also filled with artistic paintings. I highly recommend \"doing\" both of these bridges at least once. (It also drops you off near the two",

          "Must see in Lucerne, artwork is quite beautiful. It gets quite crowded as we came from Zurich and arrived mid-morning, but still worth the time to see!",
          "If you want to make a stroll through the center of Luzern walk this bridge one way and the other wooden bridge the other way.",
          "This bridge will take you back and forth to and from the Old City. Be careful because locals walk quickly and don\u2019t want to wait for tourists to stop and appreciate the art and photo opportunities. A man pushed my wife as she was posing for a pic and then was lost in the crowd.",
          "Take a side step to look on top and admire these works of art. Take care not to be pushed while you admire it",
          "The view along this bridge is wonderful and flowers are beautiful. The history is quite interesting and the paintings are good, though not the louvre standards.",
          "This is a nice pedestrian bridge dating back to probably the 1500's - sorry not very good with dates. The artwork tells stories, somehow has a medieval feeling to it. In one of the bridges there is also a small altar to the virgin and its feeling during the day vs. the night",
          "Since the Chapel bridge burned down in 1993 the Spreuer bridge is the oldest wooden bridge of Switzerland. It was part of the fortification of Lucerne when it was built in 1408. Between 1626 asnd 1635 pictures were added to the bridge. The show the dance of death.",
          "If you're in Lucerne there's no reason not to walk across this bridge. The paintings are in tact and makes the entrie bridge really a piece of artwork. The bridge is covered so even if it's raining, go walk it! It's 5' walk from the train station and lands you in Old Town,",
          "Similar to the Chapel Bridge but smaller, spans the River Reuss a little further downstream from the Chapel bridge. This one is intact with all its original paintings",
          "It's art admiration with a stroll literally. The bridge is an piece of artwork in the centre of the city bridging the Reuss river. The bridge was decorated with overhead art pieces until a fire that almost braze it to ashes.",
          "This is a great medieval covered bridge. It is part of a system of medieval walls and towers that still very much intact in Lucern. The painted panels on the bridge are carefully maintained in the open and make an interesting reason to linger and take in the view. It is a",

          "While the Spreuer bridge may not be as famous as the Chapel Bridge, I found it more interesting due to the paintings nestled in the beams. Not sure most people take the time to actually view the paintings but they are fascinating to see. You also see the charred beams from",
          "While this bridge is not as well know as the Chapel Bridge, it is worth a visit. It is a wooden pedestrian bridge with interesting, historical artwork along the way. It can easily be incorporated in your walk through Lucerne.",
          "Spreuer Brodge in Lucerne is a Must-see! A walk down the wooden bridge with all the art around gives you goosebumps! Has been kept very well preserved!",
          "Not being smack in the center of town, this bridge gets often overlooked. It is actually only a few hundred meters downstream from the Chapel Bridge and ends on the M\u00fchleplatz at the edge of the old town. The Spreuer bridge actually pre-dates the Chapel bridge by about 100",
          "Another fantastic site to see while in Luzern. Although damaged by fire and altered through the years this is still an amazing structure. The historical significance of protecting the city and the artwork make this a great attraction.",

          "This wooden footbridge is smaller and perhaps not as popular as the chapel bridge but it is still worth a look. The artwork inside is unusual and intriguing. You will most likely find it is never as crowded as the larger bridge.",
          "It is amazing to think this bridge dates back to 1408. It is really in good shape and look up to the rafters to see the paintings. Read a little bit about the history of the bridge before you head out in the Lucerne guide. When we went it was one of the least crowded bridges and",
          "Never walked this bridge before and is small then the old one but very enjoyable. Take time to walk there too. Lovely city views.",
          "This is 2 bridges west of Chapel Bridge and it gives more beautiful views, especially of the flood control system in town. The water is so clear you can see straight to the bottom in some places getting glimpses of the impressive machinery. Very cool bridge that you will miss if",
          "Dating from the 15th century, this bridge is an interesting part of Lucerne\u2019s history. Tucked up under the bridges\u2019 rafters are a series of ancient paintings.",
          "We walked across Kappelbrucke with our tour guide then went out and explored. This bridge was a little more difficult to enter from the side street but it is also a beautiful bridge filled with historic paintings to study. Very interesting to see the different bridges.",
          "This is a smaller bridge than the Chapel bridge that everyone has on their list of places that visit. However, most old town walking routes will take you over it. The biggest reason to visit this bridge is to study the paintings along the ceiling, which are much more",
          "Love all these bridges. It\u2019s like stepping cross a piece of history. Don\u2019t forget to check out the other bridges along the river as they are all slightly different",
          "We kind of came by this bridge accidentally...although, we shouldn't have. We were doing the old town tour and as we walked downriver, we saw this old wooden bridge that was built in 1408 but rebuilt in the mid 1500s account fire, I believe. It really is a cool bridge with the",
          "Spreuer bridge should not be confounded with the Kapellbr\u00fccke; it is shorter than the latter and not as old, although its origins also go back to the 15th century...... nice to walk across and back...",
          "Old wooden bridge with so much charm and historical art work .a must see in Lucerne. Crystal clear water flows beneath it!",
          "Nice paintings, good views all around, plenty of opportunities for flicks, good combination of water & man-made architecture - interesting!",
          "Beautiful bridge. Also known as Chapel bridge. Doesnt take long at all to walk across and it is a well built bridge. Check out all the detail above as well!!",
          "Walking this old bridge literally takes you back in time and you can admire the old wooden beams and the tiny little church on the bridge itself. It is not too far away from the Chapel bridge but definitely less crowded.",
          "My husband and I were traveling with a group of seniors, visiting Lucerne for two days and then on our way to a Rhine River Cruise. We were fortunate to have a local guide who brought us to the Old Town and shared its history with us. After visiting the beautiful Chapel",
          "This bridge is only a few minutes away, and getting there will take you through parts of the old town, and after crossing and all the photo opportunities, you will see how the Lake Level is controlled in Lucerne. Worth the time and the short detour.",
          "The bridge is good & well preserved. But what i liked more is, in the evening the area around becomes very lively. You will see people playing music or few young people fishing in the river. Basically people having very good time. You can buy a drink from near by restaurent and",
          "This bridge was spared the 1993 fire. Both bridges are of the same era and style. The themes of the art work differ. I liked this bridge better if for no other reason it's not as crowded.",
          "This is a beautiful sight to enjoy while walking around the town. There is a lot of history and tour guide explained and helped us understand the significance of the area. If that is not in your plans, just stroll by and enjoy the historic art -- imagine what might have inspired",
          "We had not heard about this bridge before getting to Lucern. We discovered it ehile walking around town. It appears older than Chapel Bridge and to me is more interesting. I recommend both!",
          "Very fun bridge. Lots of depiction ions of skeletons interacting with humans. Macabre and cool, if you like that stuff like I do.",
          "Beautiful bridge for photo opportunity of Lucerne. Such a shame that it burnt a few years back. They only saving grace is that some of the paintings were saved",
          "It's nice walk along the water from bridge to bridge to see the history of Lucerne. If you walk along Museggmauer and then follow the streets back to town, you'll come across this bridge first.",
          "On my first go at this historic bridge I did not notice the paintings on the roof panels, so I went back again and also walked in the right direction (from north to south), to read the story of the Dance of Death. Although this bridge is not as photogenic as the Chapel Bridge,",
          "Crossed this bridge late at night and were later confused, thinking we had come across the Chapel Bridge. Distinctly different artwork featured in each bridge.",
          "Its cool as everywhere in Lucern, similar to Capel Bridge. Beautiful in the day and night time....I dont know much about the history but It should be interesting.",
          "great place to visit. has neat art in the rafters. great for photos. wonderful place to visit with kids",
          "This was a very cool bridge. The other one kind of takes the attention because it is bigger and nicer, but this one was also worth a visit. The river is different here and the view was great.",
          "This Bridge is a little overlooked against the more famous Chapel Bridge, but don't dismiss it, as it also has some paintings once again framed triangularly, certainly a lovely way to cross over the River Reuss.",

          "Although fairly close to Chapel Bridge it tends to be overlooked, it is similar to the better known Chapel Bridge but quieter, just locals crossing when we visited. There are paintings on the rafters and close to a mill.",
          "The Spreuer Bridge is surprising for its length and content of paintings. A tour guide is a must in order to understand the history and meanings behind the paintings.",
          "You may overlook this bridge by focusing solely on the more well-known and popular Chapel Bridge, but don't! Worth taking a walk across, admiring the wooden structure, the ceiling paintings, the small 'chapel' along the way, and also the mill and churning waters alongside. Might",
          "Never having seen such an old wooden bridge anywhere else, I found this was a unique experience. The bridge has been well-looked after and restored in places but I felt I was stepping back in time. It has plenty of character and I particularly enjoyed seeing the paintings",
          "Iconic bridge, with nice views. Everyone walks over it in luzern :). Very touristy & happening place.",
          "In the center is a little, verry nice chapel, on the small platforme in face earlier it was fixed a gail, but as a \"merry-go-round\", were passing people get them \"a turn\", including the person in jail... For murders a eaven draster sistem was in use: The jail was cast into the",
          "Spreuer Bridge was another bridge nearer to the old town. There was an old mill and water wheels there controlling the water flow of the river. Apart from the timber bridge, the paintings thereat were also attractive to visitors. Have a look at the paintings there.",
          "This bridge was more interesting than the old chapel bridge, i thought, it has the old mill and water wheels and beautiful drawings along the roof of the bridge.",
          "This is a fantastic wooden bridge with beautiful views of the city and mountains. The bridge is sturdy and has intricate mural detail as you cross. The water flowing below is crystal blue and just adds to everything that makes Switzerland one of the most beautiful places on",

          "This bridge is often overlooked as most tourist tend to focus on the Chapel Bridge, but I found this one more interesting. This bridge, built in the early 1400s, contains a series of 17th century painted panels depicting the plague. This bridge also has a small chapel in the",
          "I was impressed to see the beautiful wall paintings on the bridge and also they were well preserved There was also biblical paintings and that was impressive too. You cant miss the location as it connects the 2 parts of the city and it's a common path for All commuters",
          "I enjoyed walking through this bridge more than the famous Tower Bridge because of the interesting paintings. It was also less crowded so you could spend more time looking and less worrying about running into other people.",
          "Spreuer bridge is darker than chapel bridge and less decorated outside.It is also covered walking bridge with paintings on triangular panels beneath the roof.I was amazed by the condition of hundreds of years bridge and the city council maintaining old charm of the place.You can",

          "Similar vintage as the Chapel Bridge, just downriver about 1/8 mile from the famous one. Similar in structure and paintings in the arches. Located in an even older part of town.",
          "This is a lovely bridge with interesting things to look at as you cross it, although it's not always easy to actually stop and look, due to the number of people traversing it. Another 'must-see' attraction in this lovely city.",
          "The wooden bridges connect you to and from other parts of the city. There are several pictures of events that are displayed, however, I never did have time to find out more about them. Very nice to see and walk through.",
          "We walked the bridge on a very warm evening and found it a great place to view the surrounding city. Although late in the evening it seemed very safe and was a good short cut back to our hotel. Recommended.",

          "We were surprised to see \"another\" covered bridge. The artwork is somewhat cruel and must be understood - wish we had an explanation to look at. Visit at night - fewer people.",

          "Definitely worth the walk to the lesser-known of the two old covered wooden bridges in Lucerne. This also has amazing artwork in the roofline, like the Chapel Bridge, and the same story of being almost burnt down at one stage. The river lock is also nearby and worth a quick",

          "about 5-minute walk from the Chapel bridge, it is of similar architecture and d\u00e9cor in a smaller scale. A convenient route back to town/train station after visiting the Nine Towers",
          "The Spreuer Bridge is, as others have noted, smaller than the Kapellbrucke, but it is just as fascinating. This bridge also features very old paintings but they feature Danse Macabre scenes which are quite fascinating. This bridge is also less crowded and we had plenty of time",
          "We were looking for the rapids of the Reuss River and had no intention of going to this attraction. We thought that It would have been a similar experience for us since we had been to the Chapel Bridge. The other lesser known bridge in Lucerne is shorter and less crowded. The",
          "Originally built in 1408, the Spreuer Bridge was rebuilt around 1566 after being destroyed by a flood. It doesn't take long to walk across, but make sure to take in the ceiling paintings and small chapel on the way.",
          "Though less famous, less iconic and less popular than the Kapellbrucke, this covered bridge is worth a visit. Built as part of the city fortifications and to connect mills to the city it is shorter than the Famous Bridge but it is as picturesque and interesting with the",

          "This is the older of the 2 wooden bridges. In my opinion much more interesting. Inside the 15th century bridge are a large number of scary painted medieval paintings in triangle shapes depicting that death visits all. It shows children, women, priests and monks, soldiers and",
          "Again we walk where we did in our youth....aaah such memories.Now as we leave after spending our first Christmas here I doubt we shall walk this way again.",
          "This is just downstream from the main Capelbrucke. It looks exactly the same with interesting painted panels and a shrine, only much shorter. It gets you accross from the end of the old town on one side to the old town on the other.",
          "No picture can describe the experience to see these paintings, first hand. So many of them they are on both sides of the path. The best part is looking for the Skelton on the pictures. It's a wonderful experience",
          "Visually stunning! Why walk over a plan ordinary bridge when you can walk over an old wooden bridge with visually stunning pictures.",
          "This is the second bridge. Further downstream. Certainly worth walking to see. Skeleton pictures on each roof section. Don't miss them. An interesting change and a very unusual bridge.",
          "The bridge is so beautiful in itself but then the views are breathtaking too. There is art in the ceiling so pay attention--we missed that the first time. So well made and historical. Well worth the trip!",
          "A good walk to admire the paintings on the ceiling panels. No crowds because it is November. So every tourist has a lot of space to take pictures and to just stand and stare at the artwork.",
          "A wonderful combination of both art and history. You should go see it to appreciate the beautiful work -at least once. Nice place for photos too.",
          "Yes, if you love skeletons in art, visit this covered wooden bridge! View the triangle shaped paintings at night. The glow of the lights makes the art come to life. Hauntingly beautiful.",
          "A wooden roofed bridge decorated with beautiful paintings is a must visit. We had a wonderful experience seeing the old town of Luzerne.",
          "crossing the lake and linking both sides of the town this bridge is not just a bridge but a step into history .",
          "This Bridge is original ( where the Chapel Bridge - burned in 1993) Look for the skeletons on each overhead section. The \"Spreu\" means \"chaff\" the sheath surrounding the wheat. Great Photos of the Jesuit Church ( Jesuitenkirche) can be taken from this bridge..",
          "Chapel bridge had flowers displayed on its side while this one doesnt. So I thought it paled in comparison. little is done to illustrate the panels of art but it is still a beautiful walk through it. Nice little Mother Mary showcase half way through.",
          "This structure is well worth the walk to have a look at it, it's darker and smaller than Kapellerbrucke but well worth a visit.The paintings on this bridge have to be seen to be believed....you won't be disappointed.",
          "I share the same view that it is better than Chapel, with it being a little further from the lake, it also offers a better photo opp with Chapel and the mountain views behind. It is not as long and the \"drawings\" are actually more than there is on Chapel. It is probably a",
          "This has to be the most beautiful covered bridge in the world. Its outside is covered in flowers and it makes for beautiful pictures. Inside, there are a few hand painted scenes that were made centuries ago. There is also a small chapel where in the old days, it was the last",
          "This bridge is one of the only two covered footbridges in Lucerne. The paintings of Black Death in the triangular frames overhead makes it eerily beautiful. A walk across it with the view of Reuss river is a must do in Lucerne.",
          "Unlike the chapel bridge, the art of this bridge is what really captured me. The art depicts several frames from the Black Plague. It was eerie, and deeply impactful. The things that were true for the chapel bridge are true here...you step back in time walking across this",
          "Another landmark of Lucerne. Seems to be full of scenic bridges. Loved the walk immensely. The Swiss made structures are really well maintained.",
          "This wooden bridge is amazing on it's own, but it's the pictures of the Black Plague being present in everyone's lives that really sells it. Take a slow walk and view each scene.",
          "It doesn't take long to walk across but is interesting and adds to the character of this part of Lucerne.",
          "I can't imagine there's any other bridge like this in the world--a very long wooden bridge, decorated with thousands of flowering plants outside and medieval paintings inside. Incredibly picturesque and fascinating. The views from the bridge are beautiful too! Definitely worth",
          "This walking wooden bridge is gorgeous. The history is fascinating so be sure to read up on it or have a guide. It is a short walk and not strenuous.",
          "A must see when you are in Lucerne.. this is the smaller older bridge in the town and if you like bridges, this one is lovely. full of historic paintings and loads of charm. This bridge is wonderful for memorable photos.",

          "The Chapel Bridge and associated Water Tower is a treasure trove of history. We took a walking tour with a wonderful guide who brought it all to life for us. Well recommended for a 15 to 30 mintes strolle taking time to view the paintings and charred section from the cigarette",
          "Initially thought this was going to be just a bridge, but the bridge has a history and the paintings were put up to provide a warning to people who were considering leaving the church. The paintings appear terribly grotesque and cruel as beheadings are depicted on all but once",
          "This is part of the cultural and architectural history of Lucerne. It is easily accessible and ant difficult to walk on.",
          "Steeped in history and with the original paintings in the gables this bridge is well worth the visit. The weir is right next to the bridge which is an amazing piece of old world technology that still works today as well as it ever did.",
          "Just as worthy as it's bigger brother this shows the construction well and is easily accessible with a chair lift - as is the other one- a lot less busier than the big one as well. Plan to walk over both and do a circuit.",
          "You will find this bridge just a few hundred yards further along the river from the somewhat bigger Chapel Bridge. It is very similar albeit without the accompanying tower. Also known as the bridge of death dancing explained by the nature of the triangular paintings in the",
          "This is the second covered bridge in Lucerne, a little further down the Reuss River, but worth the walk and probably with in eye shot of the main bridge. Not covered in as many flowers but still quite the site to see with plenty of artwork overhead as you cross the bridge. Worth",
          "Most tourists seem to cross only the Chapel Bridge. I probably found this one more satisfying. It was less crowded and all the artwork was worth admiring. Can be tricky finding how to get to it from the south side of the lake but worth persisting.",
          "A main attraction in Lucerne that is easy to find and easy to negotiate. restaurants close by and morning outdoor market are close.",
          "Lucerne's most recognizable sight. Interesting, lovely and picturesque. On a Saturday during the farmers market it is very busy. Worth the walk.",
          "That is one of the two wooden bridges crossing the Reuss river I have admired the old paintings [Danse Macabre] but I wondered if they do not need some more refurbishment.",
          "The paintings related to death and dying that are above within the beams are truly extraordinary -- this is one of two bridges in Lucerne with these types of art incorporated, both are beautiful and very interesting. Make sure you find both of them!",
          "A very nice walk across the bridge knowing its' history and seeing the paintings displayed. We walked across it several times.",
          "Many people on the bridge talking photos of the view of the river and the mountains I love the colorful flowers around the bridge :) You can still see some burnt areas, but it's really nice to way to cross the river.",
          "Reconstructed after fire, but retaining original character and many of the painted scenes on the rafters. Gorgeous seasonal flowers flank the sides of the bridge than links one side of the lake to the other.",
          "This is also a historic bridge with paintings. It is definitely handy to use to get across the river as well as see beautiful views of the city and mountains.",
          "Spreuer Bridge is a marvel of Swiss engineering and it's frescoes depict a turmoil-ed history. Made of wood, this bridge spans many eras and is a central focal point in Lucerne. This is a must see attraction.",

          "This is not the most popular covered bridge but I liked it best because all the triangular paintings were intact and there was also a chapel in the middle of the bridge. Don't; miss this one.",
          "This bridge is unique with the old paintings and old style we walked across it slow to see it all...",
          "This is another memorable, must-see site in Lucerne. There are wonderful old murals and carvings on this long wooden bridge. It is one of the major tourist attractions in Lucerne.",
          "I loved the covered bridges, especially the Chapel Bridge. Although this bridge is shorter, it is still worth the walk. It is unique, and it was fun to look at all of the details.",

          "This is the 'other bridge' that my guidebook didn't particularly mention and what a shame. Five minutes walk from the famous chapel bridge, just as decorated with paintings, flowers and ornate, even with a shrine in the middle of it. Definitely worth a look and a great",

          "Not something you will see anywhere else. If in Luzern definitely not something to be missed. The bridge is a work of art and more interesting than most museums.",
          "Not far from the Chapel Bridge; but shorter. The views of the bridge and the Reuss River are great. You can see the modern Congress and Concert Hall as you explore the old town.",
          "The Spreuer is the poor relation to the Chapel bridge, due to its being slightly further up river and needing to walk 5 minutes to get to it. Very similar in design and construction but not nearly so crowded. Worth a visit.",
          "Spreuerbr\u00fccke is smaller than the Kapellbr\u00fccke, and therefore not so well known - a shame. It is at least as beautiful as it's twin, and the paintings are quite quirky... A style called Danse Macabre, depicting humankinds struggle, with the suffering of death.",
          "The Chapel Bridge was my favorite,, but the Spreuer Bridge was my second favorite place to explore. This bridge is a highlight of a walking tour of downtown.",

          "Both of Lucerne's old wooden bridges are only accessible for wheelchair users if you have a Eurokey - the tourist info centre by the station will provide a list of where these can by purchased or borrowed.",
          "Everyone wants to see the \"other bridge\" but this one is not to be missed. A lack of tourists means you can stroll across and enjoy the amazing paintings at a steady pace . Another must see in Lucerne",
          "The painting tables along the roof line are intricate and interesting. Everything is in German. Wonderfully preserved.",
          "Well kept and in a lively area, where the mills used to be. The sunset lights give it a nice contrast. Not much else to say.",

          "A bridge nice and small but attractive. Close to the mini power station. Not as attractive and noticed by travellers generally. Important all the same. Close to shops and restaurants. Perfect for an evening walk. Paintings adorn the support structures.",
          "Very picturesque bridge with lots of history. A tour guide to explain was essential to get the whole story. must see in Lucerne",
          "This bridge is also good to cross and look at all the paintings. You should know a bit more of the history to really appreciate the bridge and the paintings. Beautiful views off and from the bridge. Can take nice photos off and from the bridge with the lake and mountain backdrop.",

          "Good that we crossed it first & then went over to the Kappelbrucke. It's not as well maintained or clean & smelt dank & mouldy. Infact I kept thinking if it were to give away & we were to fall in the cold rushing stream below. Note: we visited in autumn 2007",
          "It is a fun historic walk across this bridge from the lake front to the old town of Lake Lucerne. It is well worth the time to cross here and enjoy the experience of the bridge plus the added bonus of a great little historic village.",
          "We learned a lot of information on our walking tour. You would need to have some kind of tour or information in order to really appreciate the bridge however. We enjoyed the bridge from every angle, photographing it, walking across it and just looking at it. It was in the",

          "This is smaller and less popular than the better known Kappellbr\u00fccke, but is still worth a visit when you're in Lucerne. It is in good condition and looks like there have been some renovations within the last few years. Some interesting artwork as you walk across.",
          "Our tour included the Mill Bridge which we were fortunate to catch on a sunny day. It was worth while for the many angles of photos of the bridge, Lake Lucerne, and the mountains. Gorgeous!",
          "Indeed it was quite difficult to understand the stories on the printings, and some printings were quite horrible (talking about the characters, not talking about the skill of drawing)...",
          "My first visit to the bridge was very disappointing due to the fact that it was half closed because of renovations to restore the famous paintings damaged by the great fire. During my second visit I finally understood what everybody was talking about! This bridge is simply",
          "The other bridge spanning the River Reuss in Lucerne, The Chapel Bridge, is the one that is more photographed and popular in tourist media. However, do not pass up the opportunity to see the Mill Bridge (also known as Spreuer Bridge). The Mill Bridge was built sometime after",

          "We came upon this bridge unexpectedly and liked it more than the chapel bridge, probably because it seems more authentic, as the chapel bridge hat to be rebuilt after a fire some years ago. Nice views and lots of chines taking selfies.",

One bastions remains largely intact, and it now houses the Alter Botanischer Garten.\n\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nTroy. The ancient city of Troy was famous for its defensive walls. There is archaeological evidence that Troy VII, generally identified as the stage of the legendary Trojan War of Homer's Iliad, usually dated between 1194 BC \u2013 1184 BC, had walls with a carefully built stone base over four meters thick and some nine meters high in places, which was surmounted by a larger superstructure with towers in mudbrick. The walls in Homer's epic are so mighty that the siege of Troy by Achaeans lasts more than nine years, and only could be finished with the trickery of the Trojan Horse. Sections of the stone base of Trojan walls still survive on the archaeological site in present-day Hisarl\u0131k, in \u00c7anakkale Province.\nIstanbul. The system of walls around (as it was then known) Constantinople built in 412 by the Roman emperor Theodosius II was a complex stone barrier that stretched 6.5 kilometers and is often called the Wall of Theodosius. This barrier stood impregnable for ten centuries and resisted several violent sieges until 1453 when the Ottomans succeeded in breaching the walls. There was a new element in the battlefield: the Ottoman army had powder cannon and the walls offered limited resistance to them.\nDiyarbak\u0131r. Diyarbak\u0131r is surrounded by an almost intact, dramatic set of high walls of black basalt forming a 5.5 km (3.4 mi) circle around the old city. There are four gates into the old city and 82 watch-towers on the walls, which were built in antiquity, restored and extended by the Roman emperor Constantius in 349.\nOsmangazi\nAnkara\n\u00c7anakkale\n\u0130znik\nAntalya\nSinop\nRize\nAmasya\nBodrum\nAlanya\nAni\nKu\u015fadas\u0131\nAssos\nBozcaada\nEdirne\nTrabzon. The most of the city walls are still standing and are among the city's oldest buildings. In fact, their oldest part can be dated back to the 1st century AD during the Roman Empire era. Historical sources provide information about older stages of their construction.

          "We stumbled across this gem as we were wandering around the town and spent probably an hour going up and down the towers and along the walls.",
          "We walk from the lion statue to the Museggmauer. It was not particularly arduous but uphill and the large wall has several towers that you can climb and see the panoramic view of the city from above.",
          "En route to or from The Lion Monument definitely do this walk. We were unable to visit the museum but the towers and wall were of value in and of themselves..",
          "This massive wall has numerous towers that you can climb and see the panoramic view of the city from above.",
          "A free visit to this city wall when you have time. Fairly preserved. Need a bit of effort to climb up the clock tower with a view of the mechanics inside. Also can have a view of modern city of Lucerne. But if you have no time, can skip this place.",
          "The fortifications look like they are high up and tall. Let that not fool you. They are! It is a bit of a trek to get up to the walls, but worth the trip when you get there. The views are spectacular",
          "Now we know why the city guided walks go the other way! We climbed up from the round tower beside the river, quite steep but on metaled paths with places to rest. Once at the next tower we had to climb it all 125 steps to the top. You feel quite exposed on the wooden stairs, but",
          "Although only part of the city walls are accessible and only a few of the nine towers, it was one of the highlights of our Luzern visit. We climbed all the accessible towers, and the last one in particular ( the Mannliturm) gave brilliant views over the Reuss river and city, as",
          "This is a great place to visit in Lucerene if you are able to walk and climb stairs. And it's all free. It is an old fortress and series of towers overlooking Lucerne. There is a interesting display of old clocks in one of the towers. I suggest to walk up the street to start",

          "A great walking experience, offering great views on the town and the landscape. Some of the towers include curiosities like medieval clocks. Also, during summer the place is available till rather late (e.g. 19:30) so you can visit it in the late afternoon even if you do not",

          "It's a ways up to the wall and towers, but worth the walk. Some parts are very narrow, and if you're like me and not fond of heights, you'll hug the wall. Very neat!",
          "A great walk along the old city wall provides excellent views over the city. The towers were good, but it is really the walk which is the highlight",
          "Given how expensive everything is in Luzern (well especially for anyone from the UK in summer 2019 with the plunging value of the pound) it was great to have something for free. The walk up to the walls from the lower tower by the river is very steep (either a path or steps)",

          "The wall itself was somewhat impressive. However, the climb up the narrow stairs was rewarded with an amazing view of Florence from above.",
          "It has a bit of history but we were not overly impressed. It was just an OK visit. It was about a 10-15 hike from City center (uphill) but it was not worth it for us. It is OK if you have some time to kill.",
          "Easily accessible from Chapel bridge, with about 15 minutes walk from Chapel bridge. From there it will another approximately 15 minutes walk to Lion monument. We started our walking tour in Lucerne old town by first visiting the Rosengart to appreciate the paintings of various",

          "Sadly the towers were closed but great walk and lovely views over the lake and mountains definitely worth it",
          "A beautiful and different view of Luzern; it is on the hill, so despite a bit of light exercise, the panorama over the town is a generous reward. The Zytturm is closed over the winter months (we went in February) so keep that in mind if it's on your list, but the walls",
          "We had a nice (panting) walk up to the wall but the views and the history was well worth it. There is a nice trail (though careful in February - it was warm out, but in the shadow, it was still a little icy. The towers and gardens around the wall was gorgeous - and the",
          "It's a bit of a hike up the hill to the wall and towers but well worth it for the beautiful views and history. Directional signs are few and far between, but head in their general direction and the paths leading to them will be visible as you get closer. Be forewarned that even",

          "Of the towers, 4 are open to the public and you are able to climb wooden staircases to the tops of some to get a great view of Lucerne.",
          "This is a nice walk, something free to do, great views of the city. Take your time. Wander up one way and wander down another.",
          "We only went for a walk because it's near our hotel. I actually didn't know that it's also a famous attraction in Luzern. It's a nice walk.",
          "These celebrated city walls with their nine towers form part of the historic fortifications built around Lucerne from the 13th century and are very well preserved. It was quite steep to get up to the top but well worthwhile as the views from up here were amazing across the city",
          "We walked/climbed Museggmauer on our last day in Lucerne. We thought the views were second only to our Mt. Pilatus experience -- fantastic! There is a climb up to the wall itself which connects four of the towers. If you want to climb the towers, that's an additional climb.",
          "The hike was tough too much stairs but worth it . The view is great. The wall is very impressive especially the watch tower .",
          "If you are like me, you like to climb towers across Europe. Well, here are three more to climb. There are no restrictions on admission, and no cost. Climb the towers, walk the walls, or sit on a bench and relax. It is all there. Yes, the final tower has great views.",
          "Walking up to and along this wall was a fun and scenic thing to do, but beware; it does take some exertion, especially if you are out of shape like me. The towers have a lot of very steep stairs, so caution is advised. But the views from the top are both scenic and historic, so",
          "We stumbled upon the towers/wall after wandering the Old Towne. It was fun walking across the medieval walls. Not many people were up there even on a clear summer day. The views and experience were a nice break from the tour groups in the city.",
          "While access to this old wall is free, tourists hardly try to miss this out as it offers a scenic view of the entire Lucerne. Although a bit tricky to find, walking around the seemingly empty streets, a little farther away from the crowded alleyways of the old town, I felt a",
          "I went there with my friend. Had he not brought me there, I don't think I would have ever known such a place as lovely as it is. I had a beer. I would not want to eat there but having a break is nice to be under the shades when its hot.",
          "We were running short of time to do justice to this and would like to have walked the entire wall but just the climb to the top of the second tower from the river was so rewarding and interesting. Great place for photos of the city too. It's a steep climb on the approach path",
          "It takes some effort to climb the steep hill to the entrance to the ramparts, but you will be rewarded with great views over the city. One of the towers has a clock and there is a miniature version on display at visitor level.",
          "The old wall structure with high towers is the remains of the city wall. It looks well preserved and surrounding apartments blend well with it.",
          "Excellent view of the city from the old city walls and towers. A bit of an up hill walk to get there with extreme stairs in the towers to reach the walls.",
          "I had a little time to kill with my tour group before our organized tour so we decided to visit the wall. It felt good to walk and breath in the fresh air after a morning of travel. The views from the top were really nice, but not exceptional. There were no signs explaining what",
          "We originally wanted to go to mt pilatus but due to the threat of rain and not so nice weather we scrapped this and visited the walls instead. This was a cool secondary experience - I wouldn't go out of your way to do this but if you're looking for something to do and have some",
          "Large tourist groups are not found here, at least not when I went today. While everybody was in town shopping, my wife and I walked here. The wall and towers were fantastic. Not crowded at all. I only climbed one tower and got some great views. There were some other Americans at",
          "With so much to see in Luzern, the one must-do sight is this climb along the medieval walls and clocktowers of the old town, which offer the most sweeping views of the town and the soaring Alpine peaks surrounding it. We entered by the path closest to the Reuss river and I'd say",
          "Museggmauer area was my favorite part of Lucerne. Not only do you get to climb the historical fortress and see the city from above, there's also a charming farm right next to it with pastoral views. Serene and beautiful.",
          "Had a walk & chanced upon this spot... went up on a hot afternoon & it's quite a long flight of stairs to go up to the top. However, the stairs were well-made with rails for you to hold on. Once you reach the top, you could see a panoramic view of Lucerne! This is a good spot",
          "A nice walk from the main plaza, Museggmauer wows you with its pretty architecture in a leafy & quiet area!",
          "Great place to visit if you are in the area. Good views from top of the wall. A bit of a hike but well worth it.",
          "We found the town wall and remaining towers very imposing , with a great view over Lucerne. Not to mention it was free!",
          "This is the museum proper of the nine towers and wall. Very interesting. For such a peace loving people the Swiss sure had a lot of fighting in their history.",
          "This is a must do while in Lucerne. It's a great stroll along the city wall and interesting to see how the old an new cities have blended together.",
          "The trailhead is a little hard to find, but then you walk around the outside of the walls and through a door... and there's a wonderful view of the city and surrounding mountains.",
          "We wandered around old city Lucern for a couple of days and came upon this lookout in the city walls. It was a good place to escape the rain shower for a few minutes, and the climb to the top was rewarded with some great views.",
          "This place is nice to take a walk and enjoy the views of the city high up. Lots of history and lots of climbing stairs",
          "This beautiful tower was visible from our hotel room and gave us immense pleasure just viewing it ,every time we looked out of the window",
          "It's old tower .. Gud view from the top but too much stairs to climb up . Old steep wooden steps . Not recommended for aged people or with people in leg pain .",
          "It was a sunny and hot afternoon when we visited this attraction in Lucerne. From the old city, there is an uphill climb to the former wall which served as a fortification to this city. Climbing one of the towers, all the way to the top entails going up a lot of stairs. The",
          "You can see parts of the wall and towers, but really there isn't much to do or see. Much nicer things to see in Lucerne.",
          "This fortified city wall has a few towers that you can climb. There is a section of the ramparts that you can wander. You can also see the inner workings of a large clock. Finding the way in can be difficult, unless you come from the end by the river. Very neat views",
          "If you walk up into the towers, you will enjoy outstanding views of the city. It's fun to imagine what Lucerne must have looked like when the walls were built to protect the city.",
          "It probably tool us longer to find a parking spot tha actually walk on the wall but it was nice. I looked it up on the website and searched for one of the 4 towers that were supposed to be open. Actuallu there were more towers open. The most interesting is the zeitturm, which is",
          "The tower with the clock is fantastic, well worth the walk. There are lots of narrow wooden stairs, so do not bother if you cannot climb steps easily. Each tower was different, so don't skip.",
          "Hike up to the city wall and visit the clock works. If you're up to the many steps you can climb behind the clock.",
          "Beautiful views can be seen from Museggmaurer which has nine towers and is part of the city fortifications. The view is worth the climb.",
          "The old city walls are a good to check out and free to visit. The towers are worth climbing as you are rewarded with fabulous panoramic city views!",
          "We had fun exploring the innards of the towers and the mechanisms of the still functioning, centuries old clocks within them. Good exercise for both the legs and cardiovascular system too.",
          "Loved the hike up to this old tower and wall, nothing super spectacular on the insides of the towers, but fun to peruse.",
          "The wall and towers of the old city of Lucerne are certainly worth visiting if you are capable of climbing a fair number of steps. To reach the top of any of the towers requires effort. The view repays the effort!",
          "The Musegg Wall with its nine towers forms part of Lucerne's historic medieval fortifications. It runs for about 2,800ft. from the north bank of the Reuss River almost to the north shore of the Lake Lucerne. The towers were built in the second half of the 14th century. The",
          "Old city wall offers great views from its towers. Free views of Luzern. So if you are planning budget holidays in Switzerland (if there is anything like budget Swiss holidays \ud83d\ude02) worth the visit.",
          "For sure this one should be top of the list if you are visiting Lucerne as a tourist and especially if the weather is nice - you should do the full round, starting from the Noelli tower side (be prepared for a short but steep hike up) and then going up onto the city wall for the",
          "A short hike from the river and you are behind the old wall and among animals, beautiful views and the chance to hike up the old tower! So worth it for the views of the lake. The clock tower was closed but this was luckily open!",
          "Don't miss the opportunity to walk up to and around this iconic piece of Lucerne history - you won't regret it.",
          "I wish the towers were open in winter! None the less, please walk up here, above the city for stunning views of Lucerne, Lake Lucerne and the intimidating mountains beyond. You won't regret it. And it's not really a vigorous hike to get there. . . well, a few stairs to get up",
          "The rampart walls, built in 1386, surround old Lucerne. We walked part of it, including the four towers that remain open One has a huge clock that chimes hourly. Good views from the top. Great exploring.",
          "My boyfriend and I had one day to wander the city. We started our day by exploring these towers. They were beautiful and the views were incredible. It is a lot of steps, you will be sweaty and tired by the end but it is worth it.",
          "Getting up to the walls requires some climbing of steps and the towers are quite an effort to climb, but worth it for the views. Some of the flooring is uneven and the staircases are steep and narrow. There are cattle and alpacas in an adjoining field. Because of the height",
          "Close to the main part of the city, so easy to get to and worth it. It is free, which is a bonus. Beautiful views from the wall and towers. Narrow stairways up the two towers, so be prepared to climb a bit, but the views are worth it.",
          "The wall extends for quite a length, overlooking the old town. There are a couple of towers you can climb up, and a portion of the wall that you can walk along. The visit is free, but as could be expected, it is a bit of a hike, and is certainly NOT handicapped accessible.",
          "From these towers the city could be observed, its access routes checked. Protection they meant. I went to school on Musegg and the towers served us well in our lunch breaks for picnics and explorations.",
          "Given the limited time I had available for my visit to Lucerne (as part of a day trip combining Mt Pilatus from Zurich) i was only able to see the Museggmauer in the distance. It's one of my regrets that I didn't allocate more time to this trip so as to allow some proper",
          "You can capture a great city view from the fortification walls of the city. You will like walking through old city and ending up in Museggmauer.",
          "We walked along here in winter when unfortunately the tower is closed. But we headed inside the gate where a football field and track were. There was a small urban farm with chickens, alpaca, baby goats and cows. It was a pleasant surprise. And even in the rain the views were",
          "The view from the upper (southern) side of the Musegg Wall overlooking Altstadt is spectacular. I was mentally transported to an earlier time when attacking soldiers carried only a sword and shield. How overwhelming the wall and the 9 towers of the Museggmauer must have been.",
          "We found out about this place during our stay, and found out that it was a short walk from our hotel. The short walk turned out to be very steep, but it was well worth the effort. A portion of the mediaeval wall has been preserved, complete with three watch towers which can be",
          "Don't miss seeing the 9 towers and fortified wall of Lucerne. A fairly easy walk (it does involve walking up some hills) from the old city. Some of the towers are open to go inside (check for open dates and times as it is a bit seasonal). We were able to walk on a portion of",
          "The Musegg Wall and its nine towers are a must see when visiting Lucerne. The wall and towers really brought you back to the middle ages and what it was like to live in Lucerne. I especially liked the clock tower and the clock displays in it. You can see the inner workings of",
          "We walked up to the wall primarily to get a view over the town. We didn't realise the wall was so long. We climbed one of the towers and en walked along the wall, observing the defences of the old town.",
          "The old city wall and 9 towers still standing from the medieval times just underwent extensive renovations and are still offering a fantastic view over the roofs of Lucern. The 4 of the 9 towers which can be claimed to the top offering similar views, hence we choose the Clock",
          "We had looked into some places to go upon arriving in Switzerland, and this was on our list. It was well worth it, we made the climb up the tower and walked the entire leg th. amazing view and interesting history as well. Definitely worth it. Only took us about 30 min to",
          "This is part of the wall that once protected the city. You can walk atop the wall in places and climb the stairs in some of the towers to take in the views.",
          "It's difficult to imagine old Luzern without The Musegg Wall. They are the part of old fortifications and well-preserved untill modern days. There are nine towers and you can climb four of them. The walk on the walls are pleasant, not difficult and you'll see great views of the",
          "This is a very nice attraction just a short walk up from the city center of Luzern. There is no charge to enter, but check on the hours. From the wall, you will get stunning views of the lake, mountains and city of Luzern. Make sure to bring a camera!",
          "It's a fabulous place to spent time. It is free but do check opening times since it's closed during the winter months. The view over the city and the lake is magnificent. Some of the old towers can be climbed but be aware they are steep.",
          "We visited Lucerne in December and read that this is closed at that time. We decided to walk up to the wall and see what we could see...surprise...we walked 100' above the wall and there is a delightful street with the same views, as well as lovely neighborhoods to stroll. We",
          "We really enjoyed walking the walls and climbing the ramparts! Very cool. The views were spectacular! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Lucerne.",
          "Most visitors to Lucerne miss these ramparts and the towers incorporated into the wall, and this is definitely a loss. These walls, built around 1386, were a formidable defense line for the city in the middle ages and a good part of the wall as well as 4 of the towers are still",
          "Good views of the city from one of several towers forming the Mussgg historic fortified wall. For me, the best was taking photos between the towers as the towers themselves have gratings, mesh or covered windows. The favourite was the clock tower, Zyt Tower or Zeitturm which had",
          "It was MADE into an attraction. You would know if you went there because some sections of the wall are just paper-thin (hyperbole here), as in not walkable. Some sections are walkable, and the towers are definitely climbable. Good views of Lucerne from here. Start from the bus",
          "Beautiful place with a nice overview to the city of Lucerne. Quite difficult though to get up stars if there is a lot of tourists.",
          "Despite the very steep and narrow staircases, this is well worth the climb! Views of the city are really marvelous, especially if the weather is nice. Just watch out for any other tourists who barrel up or down the stairs. Start at the east and walk west passing all 4 towers",
          "This is the old wall of the city of Lucerne. It provides wonderful views of the city, the lake, the river and mountains in the distance",
          "I absolutely enjoyed the walk, you can get the best panoramic view of Lucerne from this place. The clock towers are beautifully designed and they are all unique. There is no fee to enter but stairs are steep. You must be fit physically to climb up there. What's neat is you get",
          "The old city walls with the intermediate towers is a must see in a trip to Lucerne. Climb up one of the towers to have a spectacular view of the city, and the lake from the top. The central clock tower is also a spectacle. Charming place for an evening walk.",
          "I think the restoration has been slightly overdone as you lose the sense of history of it. Very difficult to find how to get in as it is not signposted very well. There are some great views to be had the the old clocks in the towers are interesting. Still one of the 'must-sees'",
          "We finally found Museggmauer after walking through Old Town. It is not very well signposted at all. It is like an old fortress with watchtowers etc and one has a large bell. We enjoyed the walk and the views. We came out the other side of it and were lucky enough to see",

        "wiki": "Lucerne ( loo-SURN, French: [lys\u025b\u0281n]; German: Luzern [lu\u02c8ts\u025brn] (listen); Lucerne German: Loz\u00e4rn; Italian: Lucerna [lu\u02c8t\u0283\u025brna]; Romansh: Lucerna [lu\u02c8ts\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name. With a population of approximately 82,000 people, Lucerne is the most populous town in Central Switzerland, and a nexus of economics, transportation, culture, and media in the region. The city's urban area consists of 19 municipalities and towns with an overall population of about 220,000 people.Owing to its location on the shores of Lake Lucerne (German: Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee) and its outflow, the river Reuss, within sight of the mounts Pilatus and Rigi in the Swiss Alps, Lucerne has long been a destination for tourists. One of the city's famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge (German: Kapellbr\u00fccke), a wooden bridge first erected in the 14th century.\nThe official language of Lucerne is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and founding (750\u20131386) ===\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire beginning in the 6th century, Germanic Alemannic peoples increased their influence on this area of present-day Switzerland.\nAround 750 the Benedictine Monastery of St. Leodegar was founded, which was later acquired by Murbach Abbey in Alsace in the middle of the 9th century, and by this time the area had become known as Luciaria.The origin of the name is uncertain, it is possibly derived from the Latin name of the pike, lucius, thus designating a pike fishing spot in the river Reuss. Derivation from the theonym Lugus has been suggested but is phonetically implausible. In any case, the name was associated by popular etymology with Latin lucerna \"lantern\" from an early time.In 1178 Lucerne acquired its independence from the jurisdiction of Murbach Abbey, and the founding of the city proper probably occurred that same year. The city gained importance as a strategically located gateway for the growing commerce from the Gotthard trade route.\nBy 1290, Lucerne had become a self-sufficient city of reasonable size with about 3000 inhabitants. About this time King Rudolph I von Habsburg gained authority over the Monastery of St. Leodegar and its lands, including Lucerne. The populace was not content with the increasing Habsburg influence, and Lucerne allied with neighboring towns to seek independence from their rule. Along with Lucerne, the three other forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed the \"eternal\" Swiss Confederacy, known as the Eidgenossenschaft, on November 7, 1332.\nLater the cities of Z\u00fcrich, Zug and Bern joined the alliance. With the help of these additions, the rule of Austria over the area came to an end. The issue was settled by Lucerne's victory over the Habsburgs in the Battle of Sempach in 1386. For Lucerne this victory ignited an era of expansion. The city shortly granted many rights to itself, rights which had been withheld by the Habsburgs until then. By this time the borders of Lucerne were approximately those of today.\n\n\n=== From city to city-state (1386\u20131520) ===\nIn 1415 Lucerne gained Reichsfreiheit from Emperor Sigismund and became a strong member of the Swiss confederacy. The city developed its infrastructure, raised taxes, and appointed its own local officials. The city's population of 3000 dropped about 40% due to the Black Plague and several wars around 1350.\nIn 1419 town records show the first witch trial against a male person.\n\n\n=== Swiss-Catholic town (1520\u20131798) ===\n\nAmong the growing towns of the confederacy, Lucerne was especially popular in attracting new residents. Remaining predominantly Catholic, Lucerne hosted its own annual passion play from 1453 to 1616, a two-day-long play of 12 hours performance per day. As the confederacy broke up during the Reformation, after 1520, most nearby cities became Protestant, but Lucerne remained Catholic. After the victory of the Catholics over the Protestants in the Battle at Kappel in 1531, the Catholic towns dominated the confederacy. It was during this period that Jesuits first came to Lucerne in 1567, with their arrival given considerable backing by Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. The region, though, was destined to be dominated by Protestant cities such as Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Basel, which defeated the Catholic forces in the 1712 Toggenburg War. The former prominent position of Lucerne in the confederacy was lost forever. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wars and epidemics became steadily less frequent and as a result the population of the country increased strongly.\nLucerne was besieged by a peasant army and quickly signed a peace treaty with the rebels in the Swiss peasant war of 1653.\n\n\n=== Century of revolutions (1798\u20131914) ===\n\nIn 1798, nine years after the beginning of the French Revolution, the French army marched into Switzerland. The old confederacy collapsed and the government became democratic. The industrial revolution hit Lucerne rather late, and by 1860 only 1.7% of the population worked in industry, which was about a quarter of the national average at that time. Agriculture, which employed about 40% of the workers, was the main form of economic output in the canton. Nevertheless, industry was attracted to the city from areas around Lucerne. From 1850 to 1913, the population quadrupled and the flow of settlers increased. In 1856 trains first linked the city to Olten and Basel, then Zug and Z\u00fcrich in 1864 and finally to the south in 1897.\nThe 1804 play William Tell by Friedrich Schiller did much to establish the reputation of Lucerne and its environs. Schiller himself had not been to Lucerne, but was inspired to write the play by his wife Lotte and his friend Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had both personally visited the city and its surrounding canton. Goethe had lodged in the Hirschenplatz on his route to Italy in 1779.It was during the latter part of the 19th century that Lucerne became a popular destination for artists, royalty and others to escape to. The German composer Richard Wagner established a residence at Tribschen in 1866 from which he lived and worked. The city was then boosted by a visit by Queen Victoria to the city in 1868, during which she went sightseeing at the Kapellbr\u00fccke and Lion Monument and relished speaking with local people in her native German. The American writer Mark Twain further popularised the city and its environs in his travel writings after visiting twice, in 1878 and 1897. In 1892 Swiss poet and future Nobel Prize laureate Carl Spitteler also established himself in Lucerne, living there until his death in 1924.Lucerne's status as a fashionable destination led to it becoming one of the first centres of modern-style tourism. Some of the city's most recognisable buildings are hotels from this period, such as the Schweizerhof Hotel (1845), Grand Hotel National (1870), and Ch\u00e2teau G\u00fctsch (1879). It was at the National that Swiss hotelier C\u00e9sar Ritz would establish himself as manager between 1878 and 1888.\n\n\n=== 20th and 21st century ===\n\nIn August 1993, the Kapellbr\u00fccke in the centre of the city suffered from a great fire which destroyed two thirds of its interior paintings. The bridge was subsequently reconstructed and reopened to the public in April 1994, after a total of CHF 3.4 million was spent on its repair.On June 17, 2007, voters of the city of Lucerne and the adjacent town of Littau agreed to a merger in a simultaneous referendum. This took effect on January 1, 2010. The new city, still called Lucerne, has a population of around 80,000 people, making it the seventh-largest city in Switzerland. The results of this referendum are expected to pave the way for negotiations with other nearby cities and towns in an effort to create a unified city-region, based on the results of a study.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLucerne is located at the outfall of Lake Lucerne into the river Reuss, which flows from south-east to north-west. The city occupies both banks of the river and the lowest reach of the lake, with the city centre straddling the river immediately downstream of the outfall. The city's suburbs climb the hills to the north-east and south-west, and stretch out along the river and lake banks, whilst the recently added area of Littau is to the north-west.Besides this contiguous city area, the municipality also includes an exclave on the south shore of Lake Lucerne some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) away, comprising the northern slopes of the B\u00fcrgenstock. This section of the municipality is entirely surrounded by the lake and by land of the canton of Nidwalden. It does not contain any significant settlements, but the summit of the B\u00fcrgenstock is the highest point of the municipality.The municipality has an area of 29.1 square kilometers (11.2 sq mi). Of this area and as of 2009, 28.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 47.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (2.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBetween 1961 and 1990 Lucerne had an average of 138.1 days of rain per year and on average received 1,171 mm (46.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month was June during which time Lucerne received an average of 153 mm (6.0 in) of rainfall. During this month there was rainfall for an average of 14.2 days. The driest month of the year was February with an average of 61 mm (2.4 in) of precipitation over 10.2 days. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the city of Lucerne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (German: Stadtrat/-r\u00e4tin), each presiding over a directorate (Direktion) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (Stadtpr\u00e4sident). In the mandate period (Legislatur) September 2016 \u2013 August 2020 the City Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Beat Z\u00fcsli. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Grand City Council are carried by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Lucerne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate.As of September 2016, Luzern's City Council is made up of one representative of the SP (Social Democratic Party, who is also the mayor), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GPS (Green Party), FDP (FDP.The Liberals), and glp (Green Liberal Party). The last regular election was held on 1 May/5 June 2016.\n\nToni G\u00f6pfert (FDP) is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiber) since 1990.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Grand City Council (Grosser Stadtrat) holds legislative power. It is made up of 48 members, with elections held every four years. The Grand City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the Grand City Council are public. Unlike members of the City Council, members of the Grand City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Luzern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Grand City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Rathaus (Town Hall) am Kornmarkt.The last regular election of the Grand City Council was held on 1 May 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur) from September 2016 to August 2020. Currently the Grand City Council consist of 13 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS) and one of its junior section, the JUSO, 9 The Liberals (FDP/PLR), 7 Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 7 Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), 6 Green Party (GPS/PES) and one of its junior section, the jg of Luzern, and 4 Green Liberal Party (GLP/PVL).\n\n\n=== National elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 25.0% (-0.7) of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the Green Party (20.8%, +7.4), the SVP (15.0%, -4.6), the CVP (14.1%, 0), FDP (13.0%, -2.5), the glp (10.5%, +1.8).

Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 1.2%. Most of the population (as of 2010) speak German (87%), with Italian, as well as Serbo-Croatian and English with 5% being second most common languages, followed by French and Albanian with 3%, and Portuguese and Spanish with 2% each.The age distribution in Lucerne is (as of 2013); 12,916 people or 15.7% of the population is 0\u201319 years old. 26,381 people or 33.8% are 20\u201339 years old, and 25,863 people or 32.1% are 40\u201364 years old. The senior population distribution is 10,530 people or 13.1% are 65\u201379 years old, 4,208 or 5.2% are 80\u201389 years old and 900 people or 1.1% of the population are 90+ years old.In Lucerne about 73.6% of the population (between age 25\u201364) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).\nAs of 2000 there are 30,586 households, of which 15,452 households (or about 50.5%) contain only a single individual. 853 or about 2.8% are large households, with at least five members.

There were only 74 single story buildings and 1,721 four or more story buildings.\n\n\n=== Historic population ===\nThe historical population of Lucerne is given in the following table:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe city grew up around Sankt Leodegar Abbey, founded in AD 840, and remained strongly Roman Catholic into the 21st century. By 1850, 96.9% of the population was Catholic, in 1900 it was 81.9% and in 1950 it was still 72.3%. In the 2000 census the religious membership of Lucerne was: 35,682 (60%) Roman Catholic, 9,227 (15.5%) Protestant, with an additional 1,979 (3.33%) who were of some other Christian denominations; 1,824 individuals (3.07% of the population) Muslim; 196 individuals (0.33% of the population) Jewish.

At the same time, women made up 47.9% of the workforce.Lucerne is home to a number of major Swiss companies, including Schindler Group, Chronoswiss, Emmi, EF Education First and the Luzerner Kantonalbank. Suva, one of Switzerland's oldest accident insurance companies, is also based in Lucerne, as is the University of Lucerne, the youngest of Switzerland's traditional universities.\nThanks to its continuous tax-cutting policies, Lucerne has become Switzerland's most business-friendly canton. As of 2012 Lucerne offers Switzerland's lowest corporate tax rate at cantonal level.Furthermore, Lucerne also offers very moderate personal income tax rates. In a recent published study of BAK Basel Economics taxation index 2012, Lucerne made it to the 4th place with an only marginally 2% higher tax rate compared to the top canton in this comparison.\n\n\n== Sights ==\nSince the city straddles the Reuss where it drains the lake, it has a number of bridges. The most famous is the Chapel Bridge (Kapellbr\u00fccke), a 204 m (669 ft) long wooden covered bridge originally built in 1333, the oldest covered bridge in Europe, although much of it had to be replaced after a fire on 18 August 1993, allegedly caused by a discarded cigarette. Partway across, the bridge runs by the octagonal Water Tower (Wasserturm), a fortification from the 13th century. Inside the bridge are a series of paintings from the 17th century depicting events from Lucerne's history. The Bridge with its Tower is the city's most famous landmark.\n\nDownriver, between the Kasernenplatz and the M\u00fchlenplatz, the Spreuer Bridge (Spreuerbr\u00fccke or M\u00fchlenbr\u00fccke, Mill Bridge) zigzags across the Reuss. Constructed in 1408, it features a series of medieval-style 17th century plague paintings by Kaspar Meglinger (de) titled Dance of Death (Totentanzzyklus). The bridge has a small chapel in the middle that was added in 1568.\nOld Town Lucerne is mainly located just north of the Reuss, and still has several fine half-timber structures with painted fronts. Remnants of the old town walls exist on the hill above Lucerne, complete with eight tall watch towers. An additional gated tower sits at the base of the hill on the banks of the Reuss.\nThe twin needle towers of the Church of St. Leodegar, which was named after the city's patron saint, sit on a small hill just above the lake front. Originally built in 735, the present structure was erected in 1633 in the late Renaissance style. However, the towers are surviving remnants of an earlier structure. The interior is richly decorated. The church is popularly called the Hofkirche (in German) and is known locally as the Hofchile (in Swiss-German).\nBertel Thorvaldsen's famous carving of a dying lion (the Lion Monument, or L\u00f6wendenkmal) is found in a small park just off the L\u00f6wenplatz. The carving commemorates the hundreds of Swiss Guards of who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when an armed mob stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris.\nThe Swiss Museum of Transport is a large and comprehensive museum exhibiting all forms of transport, including locomotives, automobiles, ships, and aircraft. It is to be found beside the lake in the northern-eastern section of the city.\nThe Culture and Convention Center (KKL) beside the lake in the center of the city was designed by Jean Nouvel. The center has one of the world's leading concert halls, with acoustics by Russell Johnson.\nThe Richard Wagner Museum is found on the lake at Tribschen and is dedicated to the composer Richard Wagner. Wagner lived in Lucerne from 1866 to 1872 and his former villa now hosts the museum dedicated to him.\n\n\n== Culture and events ==\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nSince plans for the new culture and convention centre arose in the late 1980s, Lucerne has found a balance between the so-called established culture and alternative culture. A consensus was reached that culminated in a culture compromise (Kulturkompromiss). The established culture comprises the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre (KKL), the city theater (Luzerner Theater) and, in a broader sense, smaller establishments such as the Kleintheater, founded by comedian Emil Steinberger, a Lucerne native, or Stadtkeller, a music restaurant in the city's old town. KKL houses a concert hall as well as the Museum of Art Lucerne (Kunstmuseum Luzern).\nAlternative culture took place mostly on the premises of a former tube factory, which became known as Boa. Other localities for alternative culture have since emerged in the same inner city area as Boa. Initially, Boa staged various plays, but concerts became more and more common; this new use of the building clashed with the development of apartment buildings on nearby lots of land. Due to possible noise pollution, Boa was closed and a replacement in a less heavily inhabited area is currently under construction. Critics claimed though that the new establishment would not meet the requirements for an alternative culture.\nS\u00fcdpol is a center for performing arts in Lucerne presenting music-, dance- and theatre-events. The house at the foot of Pilatus opened in November 2008.\nLucerne is home to the Luzerner Sinfonieorchester, a category A symphonic orchestra, and to the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra, and they both hold most of their performances in the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre.\nLucerne is also home to Keramikkonzerte, a series of classical chamber music concerts held throughout each year, as well as Zaubersee, a festival dedicated to Russian classical music.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nEvery year, towards the end of winter, Fasnacht (Carnival) breaks out in the streets, alleyways and squares of the old town. This is a glittering outdoor party, where chaos and merriness reign and nothing is as it normally is. Strange characters in fantastic masks and costumes make their way through the alleyways, while Guggenmusiken (carnival bands) blow their instruments in joyful cacophony and thousands of bizarrely clad people sing and dance away the winter. The Lucerner Fasnacht, based on religious, Catholic backgrounds, starts every year on the Thursday before Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday) with a big bang at 5am called Morgenwacht (Morning Watch). There are big parades in the afternoon on Schmotzige Donnerstag (literally: Lardy Thursday) and the following Monday, called G\u00fcdismontag (literally: Paunch Monday), which attract tens of thousands of people. Lucerne's Carnival ends with a crowning finish on G\u00fcdisdienstag (literally: Paunch Tuesday) evening with the Monstercorso, a tremendous parade of Guggenmusiken, lights and lanterns with even a larger audience. Rather recently a fourth Fasnacht day has been introduced on the Saturday between the others Fasnacht days, the R\u00fc\u00fcdige Samstag while mainly several indoor balls take place. From dusk till dawn on the evenings of Schmotzige Donnerstag, G\u00fcdismontag, and after the Monstercorso many bands wander through the historical part of the city playing typical Fasnacht tunes. Until midnight, the historical part of the city usually is packed with people participating. A large part of the audience are also dressed up in costumes, even a majority in the evenings.\n\nThe city hosts various renowned festivals throughout the year. The Lucerne Festival for classical music takes place in the summer. Its orchestra, the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, is hand-picked from some of the finest instrumentalists in the world. In June yearly the pop music festival B-Sides takes place in Lucerne. It focuses on international acts in alternative music, indie rock, experimental rock and other cutting edge and left field artistic musical genres. In July, the Blue Balls Festival brings jazz, blues and punk music to the lake promenade and halls of the Culture and Convention Center. The Lucerne Blues Festival is another musical festival which usually takes place in November. Since spring 2004, Lucerne has hosted the Festival Rose d'Or for television entertainment. And in April, the well-established comics festival Fumetto attracts an international audience.\nBeing the cultural center of a rather rural region, Lucerne regularly holds different folklore festivals, such as Lucerne Cheese Festival, held annually. In 2004, Lucerne was the focus of Swiss Wrestling fans when it had hosted the Swiss Wrestling and Alpine festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Schwing- und \u00c4lplerfest), which takes place every three years in a different location. A national music festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssiches Musikfest) attracted marching bands from all parts of Switzerland in 2006. In summer 2008, the yodelling festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Jodlerfest) had a similar impact.\nThe 2021 Winter Universiade will be hosted by Lucerne.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLucerne boasts a developed and well-run transport network, with the main operator, Verkehrsbetriebe Luzern (VBL), running both the trolleybuses in Lucerne and a motor buses network in the city and to neighboring municipalities. Other operators, such as PostAuto Schweiz and Auto AG Rothenburg, provide bus services to other towns and villages.\nLucerne railway station is one of Switzerland's principal stations, and is well-connected to the rest of Switzerland via railway services operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) and the Zentralbahn (zb). There are 40 trains per day between Lucerne and Zurich, with an average travel time of 48 minutes. Zurich Airport can be reached in just over an hour.Two other railway stations are located within the city boundaries, with Lucerne Allmend/Messe railway station close to the Swissporarena in the south of the city, and the Lucerne Verkehrshaus railway station adjacent to the Swiss Museum of Transport in the east.\nLucerne's city transit system is fully integrated into the coherent and integrated fare network system called passepartout encompassing all kind of public transport in the cantons of Lucerne, Obwalden, and Nidwalden.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThere are several football clubs throughout the city. The most successful one is FC Luzern which plays in Switzerland's premier league (Swiss Super League). The club plays its home matches at the new Swissporarena, with a capacity of 16,800.\nThe city's main hockey team is the HC Luzern which plays in the Swiss Second League, the fourth tier of Swiss hockey. They play their home games in the 5,000-seat Swiss Life Arena.\nIn the past, Lucerne also produced national successes in men's handball and women's volleyball and softball.\nHaving a long tradition of equestrian sports, Lucerne has co-hosted CSIO Switzerland, an international equestrian show jumping event, until it left entirely for St. Gallen in 2006. Since then, the Lucerne Equestrian Masters replaced it. There is also an annual horse racing event, usually taking place in August.\nLucerne annually hosts the final leg of the Rowing World Cup on Rotsee Lake. Numerous World Rowing Championships have been held in Lucerne including the inaugural World Championships of 1962 and then the regattas of 1974, 1982 and 2001\nLucerne hosts the annual Spitzen Leichtathletik Luzern Track and field meeting, which attracts world class athletes such as Yohan Blake and Valerie Adams.\nThe city also provides facilities for ice-hockey, figure-skating, golf, swimming, basketball, rugby, skateboarding, climbing and more.\nLucerne hosted FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour event Lucerne Open 2015 and FIVB Beach Volleyball U21 World Championship in 2016.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Lucerne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Lucerne\".

          "We very much enjoyed the Wagner Museum, which is a quiet museum located a short bus ride away from the City Center. The museum is in an old house that Wagner once rented for six years. It has lots of Wagner memorabilia, but does not gloss over what a ridiculously bad excuse",

          "So, I'm just going to assume that you are a Richard Wagner fan, or at least a classical music fan, and get right to the nitty-gritty. This is Tribschen! Wagner's home with Cosima 1866-72. Here is the famous scene of \"Siegfried Idyl.\" The main floor is given over to tonnes of",
          "The grounds and views from the house are stunning. It's a very pleasant walk along with lake, so definitely worth a visit on a nice day. The house, although not very big, is fascinating if you're a Wagner enthusiast. A really interesting insight into his life in Lucerne. There's",
          "Unlike a recent reviewer I rate this very highly but then I am fascinated by Richard Wagner and know most of his music. Here a short bus ride and walk outside the city is the home where he lived some of the most tranquil years of his life. Here is where the Siegfried Idyll was",

          "We took the boat down the lake to visit the house, which is about a 35 minute journey (and a very pleasant one). It stops at the jetty at the bottom of a small hill front of the house and you have to walk up. The first boat left Lucerne at 10.45am so we arrived to find the",
          "Just a few minutes away from the City of Luzern, if you can imagine the perfect place to set a house, this would be it. This grand stone house, with some elements, dated back to the 15th century, but rebuilt in the 1800's, stands at the tip of a small peninsula. There are paths",
          "A great little museum in the villa Wagner spent part of his life. There is a small boat service from the pier outside KKL in Lucerne, and its a fab thing to use that to get to the museum and to afterwards stroll back by the lakeside paths, having first had refreshments in the",
          "But we enjoyed our walk out to the Museum. the location is very pretty, and there are benches for you to sit on, and take in the view. Also there was a stand there to grab a drink or have an ice cream. It seemed like a very Swiss thing to do on a Sunday afternoon.",

          "This splendid villa, located on a rise overlooking parkland and the serenity of Lake Lucerne, is a mecca for all classical music lovers. Wagner really did live here, and you can see not just the original scores of various operas, but also oddities such as one velvet house",
          "A wonderful way to spend an hour of your time. Step back in time and live a little like Wagner. You can experience his music, sit at his piano, watch movies or his opera. Sit outside, drink coffee and be transported back in time. Not a Wagner fan, but a Wagner Museum fan!",
          "This lovely house overlooking the lake is in such a beautiful peaceful setting that anyone was be jealous of Wagner having been able to live here. Nowadays it is a small but very interesting museum about the composer's life. The upstairs rooms have an exhibition with information",
          "Late July... and during my hour at this property, there cannot have been more than eight visitors, possibly less. When I spoke to the girl on Reception, she told me that this was usual. Incredible. You do NOT need to know anything about Wagner to appreciate this visitor",

          "The Nadelwehr or the Needle dam was constructed in 1800s for controlling water level of Lucerne city. We had a quick stop here where our guide explained us how this functions, but didn't have the luck or more so the time to witness its functioning. Would be pretty amazing",
          "I had heard about this site and watched a video showing how it works before we set out on our trip to Lucerne, so I was pleased when our guided walking tour took us to this area. This \"needle\" dam has been regulating the water level of Lake Lucerne since the 1800's. The floods",
          "I\u2019d read about this before coming to Lucerne and expected it to be a more prominent feature on the river but it was actually fully over shadowed as it was very small and the bridges around it were much prettier and more interesting",
          "The Nadelwehr or Needle Dam in the Reuss River in Lucerne is constructed of wooden needles (posts) to control the flow of water in the Reuss River from Lake Lucerne. It was constructed in the 1800's and is still functioning today. What makes this so distinctive is its",
          "I guess when you visit in June after the thaw, there is no need for the Nadelwehr. It was not deployed because the river level was so high. The current was also so strong that there was no need to create flow, the river had it by nature. We did get to see the northside where",
          "A place where you will read about ingeniously ideas back in the days. What is this? Water mill!!! Or at least this is what it was before. Now it's still a power plant, but with newer technology.",
          "Perfect example of Swiss ingenuity. These converging waterways are controlled by a simple manual dam during the flooding season. Our Swiss guide told us the Swiss believe if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it!",
          "The water flow in the river is controlled so as to provide the force to power a small hydro electric facility that was formally a mill. Possible to see the old mill machinery and also the clever modern engineering.",
          "All right, I will admit, this one was more of a \"Guy\" thing. My husband enjoyed this one more than myself! We both enjoyed strolling around the River Reuss which is convenient while you are visiting the beautiful city of Lucerne. It reminded me of the locks we have seen in",
          "This cool spot is where the water from Lake Lucerne is controlled, and they regulate the flow into the Rhine River headwaters. Although modernized, the Nadelwehr still retains some of the original concepts. Planks of wood are added or removed to regulate how much water gets",
          "This dam controls the water height in the city of Lucerne. It's an old system and very ingenious. There's a bubble tube on shore so everyone can see the depth of the water and whether the dam needs to be adjusted. Not sure children will find this interesting but I did.",
          "If you like engineering type attractions, check out this \"needle dam\" which controls the water flow out of Lake Lucerne via the Rheuss river (I think I spelled that right, not sure). Been in use for well over 100 years.",
          "If you are on the Spreuer bridge, then take a moment and read the information panel on the dam and power plant. No need to go out of your way, but worth a few minutes as you stroll the city",
          "The Needle Dam operates by adding or removing thin wooden poles which in turn regulate the height of the lake. While such technology is old, it still works well!",
          "I strolled past this spot on a group tour. Our guide did not stop to give us much information about it other than to say that it controlled water levels. It was easy to walk by and keep going. However there is an informational sign that explains how it works for those interested",
          "As you are walking along the river or on the Spreuer Bridge take the time to stop and check out this quite smart way of managing the water level first installed in 1859. It is still the way they manage water levels today. If you have kids point it out to them and ask them if",
          "This is a great place to visit, especially for those who are technically interested. See how the water level is regulated, and visit the Bridge just beyond whilst you are here.",
          "It gets the job done and has for almost a millennium. I hope it does not get lost to progress. I thought it was neat.",
          "Nadelwehr was a dam near the Spreuer Bridge constructed in the past to control water level to prevent flooding in the nearby area. We were quite surprised to find that it is still functioning today. We took a few photos on the wheels and the nearby gears. Really wonderful.",
          "We got to the dam from the Nine towers, and it's a place that you can't miss. It's really amazing to see something that was built so many years ago and is maintained until today. There is information around the dam itself and is really a nice spot to go to, especially that it's",
          "Heading towards the Spreuer Bridge from the Chapel Bridge, this dam is quite a feature, especially during a snow fall",
          "Loved eating by the river. Food was yummy people were so friendly and atmosphere was wonderful. Very good service by staff",
          "It is amazing to see the force and speed of the river once you get away from the boat docks, but I wouldn't call it an attraction. Walking past it is all the time you would need to spend here.",
          "The needle dam was installed in 1859-1860 after an ingenuous design developed by Poiree. It's purpose was to replace the Reuss Dam, which previously supplied water for Lucerne's mills. The water level of Lake Lucerne is still regulated by the removal or insertion of its timber",
          "Here you can see the old town water driven power from 17th century times next to the new modern 21st century water driven power plant and learn about the history of the old mills and the water flows.",
          "It is interesting to see, but spending a few minutes and taking pictures is all the time you need for this site.",
          "I really enjoyed seeing how they kept the lake levels right. It's a picturesque spot in the old town of Lucerne. Worth a visit!",
          "This Nadelwehr keeps the level of the lake of lucerne at a steady hight. It consists of many planks of wood which can be removed or put back depending on the amount of water which need to flow out of the lake. It is great to see that such an old invention still serve its",
          "This is a neat old invention to control the lake level and water flow in the river. hundreds of wooden boards are carefully pushed together to hold back and restrict the flow of the lake. Surprising that it is still used today but perhaps part of what makes Switzerland so",
          "We had some old pictures from when my father-in-law had visited Lucerne in 1946 and wanted to see this weir. It looked much the same as it did in the past....very interesting to see how it has served the community so well over all these years.",
          "With a wet spring, the water levels were unusually high while we were in Lucerne in early June. They were daily taking out more and more of the needles of the Nadelwehr being removed to let the water out faster as the week went on. The locals were rather concerned about the",
          "We have a different system to control rivers in the country. Here in Lucerne, the water is controlled by drawing back a permeable barrier - not a fixed gate. easily accessible from either the old or new town on foot",
          "It is just fascinating to see this piece of medieval architecture and technology and watch the water flowing through the narrow gap. Lake on one side, river on the other. Pity there is no or not much of explanation around.",
          "Without this weir the city of Lucerne and its bridges could get into trouble when the water in the Reuss runs high due to melting snow in the mountains. The weir helps to direct the flow.",
          "This is an interesting example of technology from the middle ages being used to regulate the level of the lake. There's not that much to see as such, but the river and the buildings and mountains make for some great pics if you can get the timing right.",

          "Overview The private collection of Lucerne art dealer Angela Rosengart is open to the public since spring 2002. Over 200 important paintings and drawings by more than twenty world famous 19th and 20th century masters (Cezanne, Monet, Matisse, Picasso,...more Suggested Duration:1-2 hours Address:\nPilatusstrasse 10, Lucerne 6003 SwitzerlandMap ",
          "Do yourself a favour and view this Art Collection. It is housed in an amazing Neo-classical building, a former Swiss bank, built in 1923-4. It exhibits the largest number of Picasso paintings I have ever seen in one place, displayed in large rooms where you can really get back",
          "With some free time and a gloomy, cold day, we decided to visit. The collection more than exceeded our expectations. It\u2019s a powerhouse! More Picassos than most major art museums plus the rest of the collection is stacked with heavy hitters. The museum is compact and well laid",
          "Great collection of Picasso works, along with a substantial displays of other artists (Klee, Max Liebermann, and other Impressionist and Classic Modernist artists). Good location near railroad station, in a wonderful building. $18 CHF.",
          "This has a collection of works by Picasso, major Impressionists and Paul Klee.They were donated by Ms Rosengart and represent her family's role in art dealing. She was a friend and muse of Picasso and there are a few wonderful portraits of her. There is an interesting display of",
          "this is an outstanding collection of Picasso, Braque, and many of their friends. Mdm. Rosengarten had a very good relation to Picasso. She is still in charge, and if you'r lucky , she will do the guided tour with you herself.",
          "Beautiful collection, especially the Picasso drawings and historical photographs. The rooms give the art presence. Helpful staff.",
          "Many Picasso pieces here as the Rosengarts were friends of Picasso. Paul Klee is in the lower level, Chagall, Renoir and more fill in the spaces. If you are a art lover on any level check this out. Stay an afternoon or an hour. We were told Angela Rosengart visits the museum",
          "Previously a bank which has been exquisitely transformed into the Rosengart houses the family\u2019s private collection of Picassos, ( with whom they were friends) Klees and others. Unlike other museums, you can give each work of art the time that it deserves.",
          "The buillding was very nice but the art left me cold,not a fan of Picasso or modern art but appreciated the renovation of the national bank.",
          "Paul Klee and Picasso are the major focus. Three floors with elevator. No photos allowed and storage required for purses and backpacks.",
          "good collection looked the Klee. the third floor picasso photo and pictures were great. use the small folded guide was best for Klee",
          "Small gallery with wide variety of art works, extensive Picasso selection. Recommended while in Lucerne.",
          "A central part of the gallery is the Picasso Museum. My wife was keen to see the Picasso Museum but I have never been all that interested in Picasso\u2019s works. However, visiting the Sommlung Rosengart Gallery provide me with a much greater understanding, insight and appreciation",
          "This is a very special private collection from a patron of the arts who actually knew Picasso and other artists of the time period. While Picasso is not a particular favorite of mine, I do recognize his genius and it was rare to see so many of his paintings in an uncrowded",
          "Large number of Picasso works, also Klee, Cezanne,Matisse, Monet and more. Nicely laid out, spacious with some seating. Elevator is available as well as restrooms and lockers for storage of your personal belongings.",
          "I cannot rate this collection highly enough, if the reviews went up to 10 I would give it 11... A real find and a hidden gem of a collection. Spread over 3 floors including a basement that used to be a bank vault. I have never sen so many Picasso and Klee paintings in one venue,",
          "We visited on a rainy day, but I would come here rain or shine. If you love Picasso, than this is the place to lose yourself for a few hours. The amount of artwork by Picasso in this personal collection is astounding. The first floor has some good large format paintings, but I",
          "Not real an art person. We had some extreme in Lucerne. so we decided to visit this art gallery. The Picasso collection was fantastic. Additionally, I learned more about Picasso the person through a shared personal relationship with the Rosengart family.",
          "Having visited world class art galleries in Rome, Paris, Vienna, Washington DC, etc., perhaps I was expecting too much. Like classical paintings and this style of art is no appealing to me. Would think that it would have more for 18 Francs.",
          "I was amazed by how many Picasso's works I found here. From the portraits of Rosengart( owner of this musuem) , I could see something had happened between Picasso and Rosengart. Maybe purely admire or a romantic love affair. There are something viewers can easily sense",
          "This is well worth your time. Fascinating collection and we practically had the entire museum to ourselves. Don't miss the video in the conference room. Gave a great background of the museum! Shouldn't miss this!",
          "Did not know much about Picasso going into this little museum, but found the abundance of his works displayed here quite interesting. We were able to see Picasso's style develop over time as he experimented with new ideas. Also are a number of works by other famous artists",
          "The most amazing museum to view Picasso's; sprinkled in with French Impressionists. No crowds , incredible access and an interesting story of art dealership. The security guard was an actually an amazing tour guide.",
          "This former bank is a wonderful museum if you like Picasso. The Rosengart family was friends with the artist, and bought as many pieces as they could. Rooms and floors are devoted to him, and feature his early work, as well as later periods. Pick up a guide, in English, German,",
          "Such an outstanding museum. Being a fan of Picasso, I focussed only on his work but there were other very worthwhile artist there. But I thought the Picasso pieces were not to be missed. They were some of his finest, I thought. But art is so subject to opinion. Go see this, so",
          "The relatively small city of Lucerne is blessed with an art collection that will thrill any fan of Picasso, Klee and/or other late 19th/early 20th Century European artists, a gift to the City from Angela Rosengart who, with her father, amassed an amazing collection of pictures",
          "This is a stunning collection, by any measure. Mind-blowing, but never wearying in the way of some much larger collections, like the Met or the Louvre or the Vatican Museum (I'm talking about single visits here.) Start at the top, and work your way down. On the top floor, begin",
          "This is one of the most touchable Art Museums we have ever visited. All those Picassos, 125 Klees...And still, an atmosphere which is far from arrogant feeling.",
          "If you like Picasso, Klee, Miro etc then this is a must see. The collection is well set out in a lovely building. There are also some fantastic photos taken by Duncan of Picasso at work as well as some with Ms Rosengart who set up the gallery. It's worth spending 20 minutes in",
          "What a generous gift of a collection housed in a fabulous space. Loved the Picasso\u2019s- great diversity of his work. Loved the Chagal and Monet too. Well worth a visit",
          "The Rosengart Collection is a private museum located in the center of Luzern, a city in Switzerland. Here you can see a lot of artworks of some painters of different periods. Really, it is an excellent collection, if you like modern paints, especially if you like Picasso. In",
          "This museum houses some of the best art in the world. The lady at the counter was lovely and informative. The pieces were all displayed and easy to navigate. The lady at the counter gave us information in English to read as they are yet to have English audio. There are stairs,",
          "The Rosengart museum was not touted as an important venue in Lucerne. It happened to be very near our hotel so my wife and I decided to check it out. It contains one of the most dazzling collections of Picasso we have seen anywhere, as well as some of his equally famous",
          "The unconspicuous entrance hides an ever so nice museum with many late Picasso masterpieces, including several paintings of Ms. Rosengart, the museum founder. There was also an impressive collection of the French impressionist masters. No photography allowed anywhere, so buy the",
          "A lot of art from Picasso and Klee, but many other artists as well. I would recommend going to the top floor first and viewing the filmed presentation before visiting the art. It is great to see and enjoy the art and knowing how it was accumulated and arranged for the public to",
          "Visited the Rosengart Collection on the recommendation of our hotel and we love Picasso. This was a totally different view of Picasso with lots of photos of Picasso and his family in real life in addition to his painting. Very interesting juxtaposition and worth the visit to",
          "A wonderful collection of Picasso set out chronologically. Make sure you get the English translation of the curator's notes at the desk when you buy your ticket. Upstairs are more impressionists along with some rarely seen photos of Picasso at home and at work including some",
          "The Rosengarts knew and collected (and were dealers for) many of the great artists of the early and mid-20th Century. This collection centers around Picasso, and it\u2019s spectacular. There\u2019s also a chronological display of Paul Klee\u2019s work, showing his growth and increasing",
          "I found the provided printed guide confused. It's not really organized with works identified by number. They identify the rooms that hold the works, but there didn't seem to be a good way to find a starting point or to follow from wok to work. For someone like me who doesn't",
          "Great time! Three floors of excellent art and period photography of Picasso. Helpful staff and readable handouts make it more meaningful. Lockers inside for bags and coats. Free with Swiss Travel Pass.",
          "Convenient location of the Rosengart Collection makes it \"must to see\" place in Lucerne.. Unforgettable experience of rare Picasso, Monet, Chagall, Renoir and other works!",
          "The location is great. just few minutes walk from the train station in Lucerne and few minutes walk from Chapel bridge. We passby some bakeries and cafe along the way before reaching Rosengart. The fee is about \u20ac18 per pax. We get to hang our jacket and store our stuff in the",
          "Best collection of Picasso's out side of Paris. Great collection of paintings plus lots of \ud83d\udcf7 of him in his studio. Also nice collection of Klee's and a handful of other impressionist and modern artist...did somebody see a Soutine! A Signac! A Miro! A Kandinsky...yes we did!!",
          "The collection is very personal and unique. There is a short film shown as well. I would suggest to watch it first and then proceed to the collection.",
          "Oh, what a collection. Picasso, Matisse & other fabulous paintings are there, hanging as if they were at your grandma's house. If you have the Swiss Travel Pass, the entrance will be free. They also have free lockers but not else more in terms of services. Anyways, go and be",
          "My breath was taken away at times as I gasped in splender at the vast array of works on display. The front reception was friendly and the art collection was well displayed, worthy of my favourite artist",
          "I was completed surprised by the breath of Picasso's work here, from early to late. The gallery is well curated and staff exceptionally friendly. If you are in Lucerne and you don't go here, you have missed an inspiring experience. Also there is the most amazing pastel by",
          "After vising a few Swiss Kunsthouses, this one was quite a surprise! A complete, extraordinary surprise! To start with: watch the film about the collection, building and the owner. Very interesting! And then Picasso\u2019s photoes, paintings, a lot of them - 80! You just walk around",
          "I have paid a visit of roughly an hour to this museum, which is one of the must visits in Lucerne. Entry Ticket is CHF 18. No photo is allowed. I have seen a visitor living upset as he was told by the ticket office that he could not pay with credit card, unless he spent more",
          "The Rosengart Collection is my favorite collection of Picasso's work. The Picasso Museum in Barcelona is quite good and perhaps more extensive, but I much prefer the quality of the works in Luzern. Both, I believe, far surpass what is on display at the Pompidou, Paris Picasso,",
          "This museum contained an incredible number of expert masterpieces (Picasso, Matisse, Cezanne, Renoir, Pissaro etc etc). We loved it. It was a manageable size gallery and we loved it.",
          "A small but very interesting exhibition. A lot of work by Picasso, not my favourite artist but it was still good to see more of his work. Some really lovely impressionist artworks by Renoir, Pissarro and others - these really made the exhibition for me. Worth a visit",
          "Perhaps I'm spoiled, being raised in New York City, and having seen 1st rate Picasso paintings at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), the Metropolitan Museum, and a number of other world-class museums in Madrid, Paris, Moscow, etc. While there was a sizeable collection of Picasso",
          "This museum has some great art (Picasso, Klee) but it is completely not visitor friendly. Labels identifying artist & title of work in tiny font placed nowhere near the painting; the \"interpretive\" handout was written in paragraphs with no numbers relating to the painting; no",
          "Amazing gallery with Picasso later works ! Works like Portrait Of Jacqueline and Angela ! There are a few Zecezanne's,Monet and Renoir.",
          "A well worth visit for anyone who appreciates art, especially those who want to see 2 of the world's most famous creative cubist artists, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. A wonderful collection, bought by the Rosengart foundation, of 300 modernist and impressionist works of",
          "We've been to Lucerne a few times but never stopped at the museum before. My daughter is currently going to an arts high school to study visual arts so we thought it would be a good stop for all of us. Impressive Picasso collection among other artists. I'm not into",
          "This small museum is the private collection of Angela Rosengart. She is the subject of a number of paintings by Picasso. So this small collection has a very personal touch. If you love Picasso, Klee, and their contemporaries, then you\u2019ll really enjoy this. We had to rush through",
          "This collection was unexpectedly excellent. They have a 35 minute video which is worth watching to learn how the family put together their collection, describing their friendship with many famous artists like Picasso. A gem for art lovers.",
          "There are some good collections of art here, all collected by one lady who knew a number of artists and purchased their work for her own home. The short video is very well worth watching as it provides the history behind the collection. A good couple of hours needed to",
          "My wife and I recently spend some time in Lucerne for vacation and stayed in the Astoria Hotel. The Rosengart Collection is housed in an old Bank almost directly across the street from the Hotel. As lovers of art, we couldn't pass the opportunity to visit this magnificent",
          "This museum has an excellent collection of early to mid 20th century works, with 2 of the 3 floors dedicated to Picasso and Klee. There are about 200 works, enough to see in detail without feeling overwhelmed, along with an excellent 35 minute video featuring Ms. Rosengart",
          "So interesting to view the art work of Picasso. To see pictures of the artist with the Rosenthal family. No pictures allowed inside. I asked.",
          "nearly without peer in the world, these ex-bank building holds the Picasson collection and supporting materials with grace and dignity. Its nearly empty often, and so you get the paintings, prints, etchings, and sketches to yourself. Some modest Barbizon and Impressionist",
          "We had previously visited Picasso museums in Paris and Barcelona. We were suprised to view the wealth of paintings and photos at the Rosengart; most of which we have never seen before. This is because many are never lent to other museums. The Rosengart collection is important",
          "We enjoyed great weather in our 10 night trip to Switzerland, so we focused our visit on outdoor activities. Not being fanatic art lovers, we have enjoyed the Louvre, the Musee de Orsay, the Prado, and the Picasso museum. We can now add the Rosengart as an art museum we",
          "The Rosengart is a very good museum for Picasso lovers. Centrally located and covered by the Swiss Travel Pass.",
          "Having the chance to enjoy Picasso, Klee, and others this close-up and with so few people was a real treat. The collection is beautifully and thoughtfully displayed, and the video in the board room on the second floor is very interesting. My only regret was the absence of an",
          "Not only does the contemporary art represent a comprehensive statement of those known to the Rosengart family, but worth the time is watching the video narrated by Ms. Rosengart as she describes her father (an art dealer) and her amassing this beautiful collection. The building",
          "Another museum that has free admission with the Swiss Travel Pass. Representative works of Picasso, Klee, Monet and others laid out in an easy to follow pattern. Well worth a visit even if you are not a lover of art.",
          "The Rosengart in Luzern has a fantastic collection of Picasso's work. Many drawings, and oil paintings that really do show the amazing range of the artist. Make sure you have enough time, an hour is barely enough, especially if you want to also see the Paul Klee collection and",
          "Great museum of Picasso. The owner of museums fa5er was his dealer. Also has a few Renoir and Other impressionist artists.",
          "This small but fantastic museum holds a stunning collection of modern art. Picasso\u2019s works are presented in chronological order and his differing phases are well noted. Paul Klee is also featured on the lower level and the arrangement of his works also give way to his life",
          "Easily accessible from many local hotels near the Chapel Bridge, this small museum is a gem. Interesting collections of Picasso's and Paul Klee's work along with a few paintings by other famous painters. Many of the Picasso's were works I had not seen anywhere else.",
          "Located right near the train station the Rosengart is a small but beautiful museum. There are known for their Picasso collection but I was mostly interested in the post impressionist. Very pleased to see a Vuillard as is one of my favorites. This is included for free in Swiss",
          "The Rosengart's and Pablo Picasso were pals. When you visit the gallery you get a wonderful insight into what those inside relationships might have been. If you go, DO NOT MISS THE VIDEO. Ms. Rosengart is quite the lady and gives a volume of information within which you can read",
          "There were some interesting pieces, but on the whole, it was a bit of a disappointment to me (I'm not a big art connoisseur). also, smallish",
          "Our concierge suggested this only as an afterthought, giving us the impression that this museum wasn't worth visiting. Boy was he wrong! This is a fantastic collection assembled by the Rosengart's, who certainly knew their art! The museum is really a lesson in art,",
          "We were thrilled to discover this fascinating collection we had never heard of before. The works of art are all astoundingly beautiful and varied, mainly by Pablo Picasso (we loved his four portraits of Angela Rosengart) and Paul Klee. We found the charming film about the",
          "With only a few hours in Lucerne, we spent them in this amazing museum. Yes, there is much here, but it's worthwhile if you love modern art. Watching the documentary about the story of the Rosengart's collection was most helpful and informative. The museum is included in the",
          "Could of spend hours and hours in there. They should sell a two day pass for the price of one as it is just overwhelming with Piscasos and impressionist art.",
          "A number of Picasso's paintings and sketches. Rosengart family had personal connection with the artist. Plan to allow enough time to view the numeous collection of other artists.",
          "After arriving in our hotel, I had left three hours for some activities by myself, as the best of all wives needed shopping. First I thought about the traffic museum, as a railway enthusiast I should go there, but afraid not having enough time, I decided for the Rosengart",
          "These are Picasso's later works - when he was using a wide brush and a minimalist style. The close connection between the artist and the Rosengarts is a story told in a video that is shown on a continuous loop on the second floor. The Klee collection was a surprise - all small",
          "Though I gave the Rosengart a very good my wife would have rated it an excellent. In the middle of town so very easy to get to. I would say it is a good but not excellent collection to view. Manly featured Picasso and Klee with a few from many of the other artists of the",
          "This wonderful collection of works by Picasso, Miro, Klee, Chagal, and others has been lovingly and expertly presented by the Rosengart family. There is a wonderful video of how the collection came about, and how Angela Rosengart was introduced to art at an early age by he",
          "There was a lot of Picasso and several other works at this museum. So if you are a Picasso lover, it may appeal to you. We found museum to be interesting but a little limited in the range of exhibits. In addition, the cost was quite high (18 francs) and I am not sure it",
          "Wonderful museum! Excellent exhibits for Picasso (very extensive!) Klee, Chagall and others. Very interesting video of the patron\u2019s relationship with the artists.",
          "Visiting the Rosengart Collection in Luzern, Switzerland was probably one of the highlights of our trip. From Picasso to Paul Klee and others you have the opportunity to be amongst some of the most intriguing pieces of modern art. Knowing that this was a private collection",
          "I didn't know much about this art museum and it was a wonderful surprise. The gallery is a very intimate setting and the Curator's notes provide great insight into the evolution of Picasso's work and an enhanced understanding of how changes in his art reflected the",
          "I found the Rosengart Collection, a small private art museum, interesting, but not necessarily a must see. The collection is made up mainly of works by Picasso and Klee. Many of the Picasso's were later works and not what I would call his best. Other artists are also",
          "If you like Picasso and found yourself in Lucerne instead of the south if France, go here. They have an absolutely stunning Picasso collection. Apparently, some rich Swiss dude and his daughter were friends with Picasso, Chagall, Matisse, and maybe others. This museum is",
          "The owners of the museum had a personal friendship with Picasso. So many pictures with the personal history explained.Clearly a love between a father and daughter who made their entire lives collecting Picasso's works. No photography is allowed though. It was better than the",
          "Picassos, Monets, Van Gogh, other impressionist/post impressionists, and a whole floor of Klee. Great value for the price; and if you have a Swiss Travel/Rail pass, it's free!",
          "- great location - impressive building - Amazing private collection - Great paintings by Picasso, Klee and other artists - Relaxing atmosphere - not crowded - Highly recommended, not to miss if you are in Lucerne",
          "Last week, while strolling through the lovely town of Lucerne, Switzerland, my husband and I by chance visited the Rosengart collection in Lucerne. We saw a beautiful neoclassical building and found out that it is a private museum owned by Mrs. Rosengart. It includes a",
          "Peaceful and convenient place with absolutely wonderful collection, located in city centre, very short walk from Central station. Enjoyed it a lot!",
          "This collection is worth the time to visit. I can't imagine a larger or more diverse collection of Picasso art in one place. The building in which the exhibit is housed is interesting also. The Paul Klee exhibit was a bonus.",
          "We enjoyed this museum of mainly Picasso paintings, lots of Klee and some Impressionist. It was quite well laid out and spacious. What a great place to view Picasso's with no crowds!!!",
          "A very impressive private collection and definitely worth a visit ! We've been to the Picasso museum in Paris and comparatively the Rosengart`s collection is more impressive! A pretty good collection of works by other famous artists as well.. (Matisse, Pissaro, Vuillard, Klee..",
          "Nice collection - well displayed. That;s all I have to say I resent a minimum amount of words Someone within your organization needs to review your format",
          "Start with the video on the top floor. We loved Angela Rosengart\u2019s stories and gave us a deep appreciation of the emotional side of art collecting and dealing. The Picasso and Klee collection is terrific. And make sure to take time to immerse yourself in all of the simplicity,",
          "Highly recommend taking the time to see this museum. The paints are on three floors. The paintings were very impressive. It was worth the walk to see it. There is an elevator for those who can't do the stairs.",
          "The setting was impressive as were the works inside. Perhaps a bit Picasso heavy but the collection was the right size at least for this tourist!",
          "This was a very nice museum. If you are not a fan of Picasso you may not enjoy it as much of the works are his. We spent about 1.5 hours there. Entrance fee was 16 CHF.",
          "I love art and usually make it a point to visit any museum that houses impressionistic art. This was well worth a visit. I especially enjoyed the photos of Picasso. Would highly recommend!",
          "The Rosengart Collection sits in a beautiful museum that holds impressive art while not being too overwhelming. The arrangement is thoughtful and the rooms are light and spacious. Wonderful Picasso art and as others have mentioned some great intimate photographs. Entry is not",
          "This collection of art work is enhanced by showing a number of works by Picasso. Picasso had known the family who owned the building and this relationship is explored. There are a number of photographs showing the artist at work and play.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. I am not a big Picasso fan, but I appreciated the breadth and depth of his work shown here and I especially loved all of the intimate photographs of him with his friends, working, vacationing, etc. These photos truly bring an additional",
          "We visited the Rosengart exhibition with the impression of being blown away by Picasso's artwork, and whilst it was stunning the thing that really took us was the great set of photographs on display of Picasso taken by David Douglas Duncan which showed the great man off at work",
          "This museum has a fascinating private Picasso collection and the story of the family\u2019s connection to the painter is just amazing. Watch the movie and then go again and look at some items emphasized during the video! It is one of our favorite spots in Lucerne.",
          "Not major pieces but incidental work, not really intended for publication or showing. Photos of Picasso at work perhaps the most interesting part.",
          "This is a private foundation established by Angela Rosengrat, an art dealer to house her private collection. It is primarily Picasso and Klee. There is a student and senior discount",
          "Right in the centre of Lucerne, the Rosengart is a wonderful museum, not too big but sheer quality. The people there are even better: forgot an item there and it was sent to me to the UK. Many thanks!",
          "We visited the Rosengart as part of our city museum pass. I'm no art expert, but this place was pretty impressive with all the Picassos and other names from that era. It was very quiet while we were there (Sunday afternoon).",
          "Very personal but, I cannot put artists like Klee in the same category or class like the masters or impressionists. I find modern art including later Picasso to be odd, juvenile and self indulgent. That being said... if those artists rock your world\u2014 go visit.",
          "My husband and I engaged a private guide who recommended a visit to this local gem; we're so glad that she did. The principle benefactress' father had a massive collection of impressionists, Picasso's et al. and she, now in her nineties, has further enhanced the holdings with",
          "Rosengarten collection is an unexpected gem of modern art in Lucerne - Picasso and Impressionists ! Not to be missed!",
          "That there is this sheer volume of Picasso's in one collection is mind-boggling. To see his work as I have never seen it before has made me realize even more just how much of a master he truly was at his craft. If you want to truly study the works then obviously go earlier in",
          "Extensive collection of Picasso. Boobs galore but if you like the great mans work, this is the place.",
          "If you love art then a trip to this museum is a must. Angela Rosengart donated her extensive collection of Picasso and Klee (plus other renowned artists) to the people of Luzern. The gallery arranged well to facilitate appreciation of the masterpieces on display. So glad",
          "The Sammlung Rosengart gallery is a small gallery with an emphasis on the life and works of Pablo Picasso. There are also some works by Renoir, Monet and other famous artists, but it is Picasso that is the focus.",
          "The Rosengart Collection is an interesting museum which has several works by Pablo Picasso and Poul Klee. The collection is housed in a building that was previously used by the Swiss National Bank. A video about the founder Angela Rosengart is shown in the meeting room on the",
          "The Rosengart museum, which is a private collection, is a must in particular if you like Picasso or Klee. In my opinion it's one of the best (modern) art museums in Switzerland. Different from other museums there aren't temporary exhibitions, however, so far I've seen the",
          "One of best Picasso collection museum. Different periods. Paul Klee and few other well known masterpieces. Our children too small to appreciate them. Still a good experience. In a former Swiss National Bank building.",
          "If you can visit only one museum in Lucerne, this should be it. The collection of Picassos alone is worth more than the price of admission but there is so much more. And if you are lucky, you may get to meet the charming Angela rosengart, the owner of the collection and the",
          "The building is great and the collection of art is fabulous. I was neutral about Picasso before seeing so many of his pieces. They are so thought provoking and I could stare at one for 5 minutes and keep seeing something new. Loved it. I love Impressionist paintings and",
          "We spent a very happy 2.5 hours here. A fantastic collection in and of itself, but also a welcome amount of detail in the information sheets supplied (available in a range of languages) to help you trace the narrative through the rooms and understand the techniques and artistic",
          "If you like Picasso you will love this Museum. Amazing collection in beautiful building, a must see!",
          "Amazing place in terms of art but the woman who works at the tickets counter was one of the most rudest people I have ever encountered. My nieces were so upset by her behavior and the whole experience left us a bad taste. Did not even assist when we asked to charge our phones",
          "Stunning Klee and Picasso, which form the centre of the gallery's exhibits, but still lots to like about Kandinsky, Modigliani, Braque and many others. If you like this period then the Rosengart collection is superb. Expensive to get in, like all overpriced Swiss galleries..",
          "Enjoyed the works of Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee and Classical Modernism that included Monet, Bonnard and Chagall amongst others. It takes not more than an hour and cost $18 SF which is very pricey - there are 3 floors It is great for Picasso fans but suggest get the Museum",
          "This museum is housed in a former bank building. It containts the collections amassed by the Rosengarts. It is a must-see if you enjoy the works of Picasso and Klee. The rooms still display the elegance of the former bank building. There is a video playing in the",
          "Gallary shows art work by great artist Picasso and few other artists. Very adorable collection. Have to pay some entry fees.",
          "we loved this! the only thing that could be improved would be to move the movie to a bigger screen and area that would be easier to watch. the way the room is set up it was tough to see and hear the movie which was very interesting and i wish i could have gathered more",
          "A very extensive Picasso and Klee collection , as well as art from other 19th-20th century masters. some of the Picassos are very different than those I have seen elsewhere- including in Paris and New York",
          "Some 300 Picasso under one roof, in one collection, permanent, you won't to see elsewhere (the owner doesn't gives them out), plus throw in a couple of other cubist and existentialists to mix it up a little......mind blowing!",
          "This is mainly a collection of works by Picasso and Klee. The mention of Monet and Renoir is probably there just to attract people, because beyond a couple of paintings, that's it for impressionism.",
          "Marvelous collection of Picasso with an emphasis on his later works, a better collection of Klee than Bern's Klee museum and a limited collection of some of the best art by mostly French artists from Corot to Matisse. Buy the catalog! All the works are reproduced and you'll be",
          "Where can you see 133 Picasso's? Where can you see other famous artists up close - only here - the owner/curator is 85 years old and takes pride in her collection. it's a MUST see - even if you don't like art museums.",
          "This is one of the finest small museums I have ever been to. Collection starts with a few Impressionist works and has a wonderful collection of Picasso and Klee. Please don't miss this if you love art.",
          "This museum was highly recommended so I felt it was a must, especially since I love art. Let me say, you need to like post post-impressionism and classic modern art. You need to really enjoy Picasso. There is a shockingly large collection of his work and photos of him with the",
          "Wonderful collection of Pablo Picasso s paintings and sculptures. Especially interesting are the pictures of him as he worked and the documentary on him and the Rosrngart family. Easy to locate with the city map and close to the train statiom",
          "Room after room of Picasso, who was a friend of Rosengart. Many works by Paul Klee, who was a Swiss artist and a favorite of my husband's. We also really enjoyed seeing works of many outstanding artists, including Monet, Chagall, Renoir, Kandinski, Braque, Cezanne, and Calder.",
          "Wonderful original works by Picasso and Paul Klee! Small museum but the art work and artists represented in the museum are not to be missed! There is even a phography exhibit which givess you an inside look at Picasso's personal life. Fascinating! Even my 16 year old daughter",
          "This is again a must see attraction in Switzerland and collection of Picasso is very good. Plan for atleast 2-3 hours",
          "We are not huge art museum types. However even we understood this was a special and important collection. For me someone with a basic knowledge of impressionism, the 2 Monets were standouts highlighting his genius. Also the Seurat (contrast in colours and brushstrokes),",
          "I came for the impressionism but this museum is all about Picasso and Paul Klee. However, it has fantastic works by these artists and is very well organised. I'd definitely recommend if you're into art history, but just be warned you won't be seeing a variety of artists. They",
          "Free entry with Swiss railpass. The building itself a work of art the paintings and drawings wonderful.",
          "A surprise delight to see so many Picasso's works. Comparing with the best I have seen at Picasso Museum in Barcelona, this museum has more collections from later period of Picasso\u2019s work. It was very interesting to see many Picasso\u2019s photographs, a window of opportunity to know",
          "Picasso at his best. Great collection all owned by one family. Well laid out and interesting. Wife compared it to some of best she had seen. Close to the lake and worth a visit. Takes about 2 hours.",

          "What an unexpected pleasure. I had no idea how wonderful this place would be. Room after room after room of artwork from many different masters. The focus is on Picasso although you will also find other artists. The place is serene and peaceful. I could stare at those",
          "I enjoyed my brief visit to this museum on my recent trip to Luzern. So many wonderful paintings by famous artists. There were numerous works by Picasso as well as many other masters. Had my schedule allowed, I would have liked to have spent more time here.",
          "This is a wonderful collection of primarily Picasso's works. There are other artists here too such as Monet, Renoir, Matisse, Kandinsky, Klee, etc. But most of the works are those of Picasso. Very interesting, there are many photographs of Picasso working. These photographs are",
          "This wonderful building and beautiful gem of a collection will delight you, especially if you are a Picasso fan. It will also allow a personal experience with other Masters such as Renoir, Matisse, Seurat, Kandinsky, Calder, Monet, Cezanne, Chagall and Modigliani.",
          "I had NO idea what awaited me! I was so delighted with the depth of Picasso pieces at this museum, as well as the other treasures such as Calder, Chagall, Kandinsky, Monet, Miro, Seurat, Signac, Renoir, and my favorite Modigliani. This collection reminds me of the Courtauld",
          "This museum was a total surprise to us - the collection of Picassos and Klees and, to a lesser extent, Braques, are simply astounding.",
          "Up close Picasso. Look at the brush strokes. My wife hated it because of the nudity but it's art! You're not allowed to take pictures..... A few other artists upstairs that are really good too but the downstairs is a waste of time; I didn't get it or like it. Just the",
          "We bought the two day 10 museum Lucerne pass. Worth it. Didn't plan on going to this museum but did because we bought the pass. So glad because the museum was one of the highlights of Lucerne. The Picasso's were so great. Never seen so many. The Klee's were OK but that is what",
          "I have never found Picasso' s work to be particularly inspired, but the Sammlung Rosengart changed my mind. Get really up close to some Picassos and submerge yourself in perhaps one of the largest collections of his works under one roof. The museum tour starts with you locking",
          "We enjoyed a leisurely tour of The Rosengart on Easter Sunday in Lucerne. I learned so much about Pablo Picasso through the displays of his artwork and sculptures, but a bonus was an entire room with photographs of Picasso and a sheet with English translations describing the",
          "Rosengart was one of the first Swiss museums I visited 12 years ago, and I keep returning. A baffling \"Who's Who\", it seemed on my first visit - so many of the famous European artists are represented. Personally I experienced the Picasso paintings as the most stunning. Also a",
          "The Picasso exhibit is amazing. The admission counter lent me a set of explanation sheets in English. There are some sequences of painting that really help you see what Picasso was trying to do. The exhibit is supplemented with some other paintings be well known impressionists.",

          "Three delights for three floors of excellent Art. One floor is devoted to Klee, one to Picasso, and one to Chagall and his (approximate) contemporaries. I recommend doing the museum fast to get the overview from this fine collection. Take a breather (go out for a coffee) then",
          "First time to see Picasso. They had a very comprehensive English paper guide that helped me a lot to understand what I saw. Also the pictures of Picasso and Mr and Mrs Rosengart added an extra touch. Take at least 90 minutes when visiting.",
          "Ventured into the museum to see an impressive collection of Picasso paintings and drawings. A selection by Klee was also I residence. Interesting collection of photographs seeing the artist at work. Well worth a visit for art lovers.",

          "we stopped by the Rosengart and enjoyed the visit. The basement was pretty much all Klee. The first floor was almost all Picasso with some pretty good stuff there. On second floor there was a variety of Manet, Matisse, Cezanne and a few others My favorite part was on the 3rd",
          "Great simple art show with a lot of simple, small Picasso's drawings. Being non spectacular this is maybe a place for specialists and connaisseurs (french!)",

          "This museum was founded by the daughter of a well known art dealer who was a friend of Picasso. His daughter was featured in a number of Picasso's works and there is an interesting video where she discusses her meetings with Picasso. Ther are also works of Klee and other artists",

          "Very convenient to downtown center. Curator had done a nice job of organizing the Picasso paintings and some by Monet",

          "Some wonderful paintings by Picasso, Chagall and Klee, if he is your cup of tea all donated by Angela Rosengart. I love this place. The only negative is the grumpy ladies on reception. I hope they are volunteers and not being paid for their surliness. Don't let them spoil your",

          "Even though the weather was beautiful this morning after a rainy weekend, I was looking forward to going to this museum. I enjoyed the art work and the personal connections to the museum owners. This museum reminds me of the Menil Collection in my hometown, Houston, so I'm glad",

          "Wonderful to see the variety of Picasso works and lovely to have the photographs of his life. The photographs were moved from the previous small museum to this one. Unfortunately, many of the photos that we had seen in the old museum must now be stored. We would have loved to",
          "Interesting collection of Mark Shagal paintings. Pablo Picasso painting presented. Very interesting photographs of Picasso",
          "Great Picasso collection plus a much smaller collection of Paul Glee and other Impressionist / Early Modern artists. 3 compact floors. Located right in \"New Town\" a few blocks from train station. We had Swiss Passes so it was \"free\" (included) and well worth a quick visit.",
          "This is a fabulous collection (one of the best in Switzerland I believe) if you like post-impressionist or modern art. It houses art from basically every major artist during those periods, although the emphasis is on Picasso and Klee. Upstairs there was an exhibit on photos of",
          "Great collection of Picasso and other greats, the owner's father had a personal relationship with the artists so witnessing that living history and detailed video story is worth it in itself. The art is great, well presented, awesome space!",
          "So happy to have the chance to view the collection of Picasso and other artists. Highly recommend visit to the museum if touring in Lucerne.",
          "Just loved the Klee works downstairs and although there were collections of possibly more promoted artists, I thought the Klee drawings etc the best. You do need time to study them though.",
          "Just a marvellous little place and oder you are lucky you will Madame Rosengart - an experience as if you would meet Picasso himselfe - forget about the ticket price - an afternoon in heaven is priceless and if you do not think so, you are lost",
          "This museum presents mostly later works of Picasso as well as other artists of the era. The works are well displayed and the information sheets, available at the ticket desk, are excellent.",
          "One level dedicate to Pablo Picasso's paintings which are wonderful to see in the flesh and another floor with photos of Picasso and his life and print making and sketches.",
          "Impressionistic art; many Pablo Picasso's, free with swiss pass. Many personal photographs of donor and Picasso.",
          "If you love Picasso and some similar painters, it is amazing what you can find in this relatively small but great collection.",
          "This small private museum is a gem containing an amazing collection of Picasso from various periods as well as a wonderful Paul Klee collection and an exquisite blendof other world famous painters such as Braques, Bonnard, Cezanne, Kandinsky, Miro, Modigliani .... A must when",
          "Great collection of Picassos! And really great pieces by him at that! And a small but lovely collection of impressionist paintings. The Rosengart is a stately building, and the galleries are nicely laid out. What Is uniquely great about this museum is that it's not overrun",
          "This gallery delivers on their claim as a premier location for these artists. A sprinkling of impressionists made it all more interesting for me.",
          "Started off \"on the wrong foot\" with this visit. It's expensive to visit with tickets being 18CHF or 16CHF( if you have a guest card), however you can't pay with a credit card unless you pay 20 euros. So to use your credit card, you are forced to buy postcards etc.. to get it",
          "Really a gem. Well worth visiting, and even though I have been there in the past, I will go again when I return to Lucerne.",
          "The Picasso exhibit is outstanding. In retrospect I feel I gained a great deal of knowledge about his progression as an artist, his relationships, and his approach to his craft. That's quite an accomplishment for an exhibit, don't you think? Personally I was mesmerized by the",
          "We have been to many museums over the years and were not impressed by the collection of Picasso works. He was prolific and the Rosengarts had a special relationship with him, but we have seen a wider collection of his works at many other museums. Also there was minimal seating",
          "I am by no means an art connoisseur or very educated in terms of art, but I thoroughly enjoyed this relatively small and private collection museum. The Rosengarts (father and daughter) had a personal relationship with Picasso and that shows through in the exhibits,",
          "not too overwhelming[in a good way] like very big museums. Showcased mainly Picasso and Klee both modernists. Had some good paintings of Chagall and Cezanne. Has a video of the Rosengart family. Entry free with holders of Swiss pass.",
          "For me, this was an OK attraction. I think Picasso is one of the most overrated artists of all time, but for a Picasso fan this is collection is probably pure gold. Still, I had a Swiss Pass which made it free, and it was starting to rain, and it was close to the hotel, so it",
          "I went with my son this Saturday after he had finished is art course The museum is housed in the old Swiss National Bank Building. I do not know if the Gold was kept here but it was a very interesting building to see in itself There is a large collection of Picaso paintings",
          "This museum has accumulated a small but very sophisticated collection. Worth two hours of your time...",
          "A wonderful museum for those who love early 20th century art. Not big but nearly each painting is a masterpiece.",
          "This was ,by far, the best laid out art showing I have been to. It seemed very personal and inviting. It was also wheelchair accessible which was important for us. A must see in the town.",
          "earlier known Piccasso Museum yes its a mecca for us our ART LOVERS OF PICASSO sir. very well put up show. it closes down at 6 pm so need to rush in thieving. keep some good time to browse through all in the morning itself to satisfy your ART PALETTE :)) we were lucky to have it",
          "Fantastic museum wonderful collections of internationally famous and one local homegrown artist. The collection includes, Picasso, Monet, Seurat, and many more famous artists.",
          "I like private collections because they're often a wide brush stroke of the times. Here, however, the collectors focused on collecting all of the Picasso, and Klees they could find. I'm a fan but not a groupie so felt a little saturated.",
          "Great collection. Many works of Picasso and Klee among others. It is a pity that no photography is allowed. Anyway it is worth your visit.",
          "This understated art gallery has a wonderful collection of Picassos and other works and is well worth a visit",
          "centrally located, well laid out, but really not the greatest collection of paintings, and heavily biased to Picasso. Lucerne does not seem to be into visual art, and I guess surrounded by such visuak beauty hard to compete. I found sitting at lake edge watching the",
          "OK, so it's not the worst thing in the world to go to this museum. Frankly, without it Lucerne, a pretty small city, would have little in the way of culture. Apparently, this museum comprises a collection of the Rosengart family and also the Picasso Museum collection, both of",
          "Can't believe that I had never heard of this place before. If you love Picasso then you will really enjoy this collection. There are also some works by Klee, Monet, Kadinsky, Miro and others. Nice collection, quite near train station, worth an hour visit.",
          "The art work is apealing if you like impressionist style, interesting audio guide, very deep!! lots of religious symbolism. Would not return.",
          "It started to rain during our time in Lucerne, so it was the perfect opportunity to get indoors and enjoy Picasso. Ask for the student discount, If I remember correctly we paid half admission using that when we showed our student ID. There is so much Picasso in here, it's",
          "This private collection is a must see for art lovers.The Picasso collection includes paintings of Mrs Rosengart. The Chagall collection is small but very interesting. A large Klee collection worth a visit. With Swiss travel pass their was no entrance fee",
          "We enjoyed our visit. Collection is outstanding, pity that no photography is allowed. Must go if you are at Lucerne.",
          "I was very surprised with the amount of artwork from Picasso available at the museum. It is a must see. Pablo Picasso had an interesting view and his paintings hide many interesting things I challenge you to find.",
          "One of the finest private art collections we have visited. Picasso and Klee are featured. Don't miss watching the video done by the museums founder detailing the family's relationship with Picasso. Architecturally interesting building. Three floors. Wheelchair accessible.",
          "This is an amazing collection and Mrs. Rosengart is an incredible woman! Take your time with no one in your way to truly admire and study a remarkable collection. I even met Mrs. Rosengart in person right near the beautiful portraits that Picasso did of her. I was in awe. Watch",
          "What started as a private collection (and developed into a very substantial private collection) was turned into this \"museum\". If you're a fan of modernist art, you will probably enjoy visiting. The attractive building gives nice space, and there are rarely any crowds at all. In",
          "The Rosengart museum is a fabulous private collection of works by well known masters, presented in an acessible and approachable manner. At the counter they will give you a guide in english which is very helpful. The collection is extensive and very impressive, and the price is",
          "Many Picasso,s and many other valuable arts.When in Lucerne it is a MUST.Excellent collection. reasonable prices (16 sfr) ,highly recommended!",
          "If you are interested in modern art, especially Picasso, this is a must see. The collection is in the family of one of the worlds great art dealers, and he was a big promoter of Picasso and other modern artists. It is currently owned by Mr. Rosengart's daughter, and it is",
          "I didn't know about this gallery until I arrived in the city. How lucky to find this amazing collection of Picassos and Klees. Hundreds of works on paper, a must see if you are interested in either of these artists. No crowds, easy to get close to each work to examine techniques",
          "Fairly expensive, but so are most things in Switzerland. :) No bags are allowed in, but there are fee lockers just after the ticket booth. You can also borrow a guide in English, which has information about the collection\u00b4s original owners, their relationship with Picasso and",
          "An amazing collection from what was once a private gallery to what is now a former bank building. Finally a good use of former \"bank\" buildings.",
          "This generous lady has donated her impressive art collection for the public to see and it is housed in a beautiful old building which used to be a branch of the Swiss National Bank close to the centre of Luzern. Her story can be seen on a DVD playing on an upper floor of the",

          "I well remember my job-duties some 50+ years ago, walking as a young banking apprentice from my small nearby bank to the hallowed halls of the Swiss National Bank, carrying immense amounts of cash in the pockets of my jacket. Now this serene banking structure has morphed into a",
          "This is one of the most lovable small museums I've seen in my life: Mrs Rosengart has donated a wonderful collection of paintings and drawings of Klee and of Picasso and some impressionists to this foundation in the classical building of the former Swiss National Bank, Lucerne",
          "quiet gallery with huge number of Picasso and Paul Klee paintings and sketches. DO watch the subtitled film and how the foundation Rosengart came into being and why the family Rosengart had such a huge number of paintings. Photographs by Duncan of Picasso at work and at play are",
          "This gem of a collection is littered with hundreds of pieces from Picasso. This place is worth the effort and money to visit if you are in Lucerne. Don't miss this jewel.",
          "The Rosengart is surprisingly quiet and uncrowded in spite of being a rather large collection of Picasso. Don't miss the drawings in the basement!",
          "This was a highlight of our visit to Lucerne - it should be a reason to go to Lucerne in and of itself - stunning collection of Picasso's and Klee's, beautifully hung in a wonderful building - do not miss this collection!",
          "What an excellent exhibition of Picasso's works, and some other great artists, this place is a gem. Thanks to the Rosengarts we can all enjoy",

          "Incredible private collection focusing on Picasso and Klee, also some good works of other great artists. I've found it accidentally, it's not even mentioned on the Lucerne Wiki page. Highly recommended!",
          "The Rosengart Collection is a privately owned museum with a fantastic collection of Picassos (the Rosengart's were friends with the artist and there are a lot of drawings) and Klee. But there are some other fabulous pieces to see. The museum is close to the train station and",
          "What a life the Rosengart's have had. With close friends like Picasso and Klee, what can one say about seeing so many of their works on display in one space. This has to be one of the finest private collections that is open to the public. A must see.",
          "This private museum was just a block from our hotel. It is housed in an old bank building and contains an incredible amount od original Picassos and Klees. There are many other famous artists represented as well.",
          "The story of the collecting of the museums contents done by a daughter and her father was as special as the collection of Picassos and Klees",
          "We spent about 2 hours here admiring the collection of artworks collected by Angela Rosengart & her late father. The rooms of Picassos are a must see if you are a fan. There is a collection of 125 artworks of Klee as well as rooms featuring paintings by artists like",

          "Absolutely terrific. In any other city,the masses would be running a muck and overtop each other. Not in Lucerne, probably not 20 people there and all the room and time to ponder,observe and appreciate Picasso, Klee,Monet,Renoir. It's an absolute gem...A must see.",
          "This collection of classical impressionists, housed in the beautiful Rosengart Collection building is simply wonderful. The collection of Picasso paintings, so sympathetically curated is enhanced by the family's relationship with that artist and the candid photographs of the",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit to the Rosengart Collection, conveniently located near the Lucerne train station. Recommend starting with the informative, well-produced video on the 3rd floor (25-30 minutes), which describes the Rosengarts' love of modern painting and",
          "As an fan of the impressionists and especially Picasso, I loved this museum. Interesting mostly later works by Picasso, not the stuff you usually see. Also a great Paul Klee collection. The best part are the pieces that relate directly to the Rosengarts, they were friends with",
          "Especially for Picasso and Klee fans, this is quite simply one of the great museums. Close to Luzern train station, the Rosengart collection is exhibited on three floors of a 1920s building revamped by the well-known Swiss architects, Diener and Diener. Start on the top floor",
          "For those of us fortunate enough to find ourselves in this beautiful Swiss city I strongly recommend a visit to this beautiful Museum, not the largest in the world but the works of art are truly worth the visit. What I found were paintings by artists, that I had not seen",

          "The Rosengart collection is fantastic, particularly as we had no idea that it existed and literally stumbled across it while exploring Lucerne. There are quite a lot of beautiful works by Picasso on display - he was a friend of the family so it includes a series of portraits of",
          "Suchg a shame that so few tourists visit this wonderful Gallery. What was once a bank is now a treasure trove of art works. The collection of the Rosengart Family in Luzern reflects the work of two generations of art dealing, and the personal contacts with the artists. This is",

          "Paintings were arranged in a very interesting way to allow vistors to see how artists like Picasso, Paul K etc had evolved in their painting techniques. English handout can be obtained at the front desk, will propose visiting the 1st floor, then the video on lvl 2, followed",
          "So glad we stopped here on our trip. This is a wonderful collection of early 20th Century art (Picasso, Klee, Chagall, and others). What makes it amazing is that it was all collected by one lady (and her father) who knew all the artists personally. One entire floor is dedicated",
          "On the last day of my visit in Lucern I had the chance to see the Rosengart Museum, a place where Art meets Class ... Mrs Rosengart, the soul of the Museum and Picasso's model, donated all the paintings she owns from the artist to this amazing museum.",
          "This museum has a wonderful collection of art and is definitely worth spending a morning or afternoon if you enjoy modern art. It is the perfect size that you can take an hour or two and walk through without getting tired. They also provide guides in many languages.",

          "I had no idea that in small Lucerne I can find so great pieces of art. This is place where you can easily observe artistic journey of great artists. Even if you are not art historian, their art story will be clearly visible for you. I thought I know picasso, but some of the",
          "A lovely, focused collection. If you go make sure to watch the video of the donor/founder of this collection. It makes the experience incredibly personal. I am not an avid Picasso admirer, but it was worth the visit. I learned a great deal about him, his art, and the",

          "We were in Luzern on 1st November, which turns out to be All Saints' Day and all the shops were shut. We like modern art and decided to go to this gallery. We had seen exhibitions of Picasso and Klee at the Tate in Liverpool and London, and were keen to see more. What an amazing",
          "Interesting Picasso and Klee collections, as well as a few stunning impressionist pieces. It is not huge and therefore not cheap at 18 CHF a head, but it was actually worth every penny, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.",
          "Lots of paintings by Picasso, and actual photos of Picasso. Great museum. Apparently, Ms. Rosengart knew Picasso, so she had lots of his works, as well as the photographs. Very interesting.",
          "This is more my wifes interest and she was blown away and great to see her so happy almost emotional! That said I am not the biggest lover of art yet found it interesting and loved the level of information given. The video about the Rosengart family was very interesting too.",
          "Loved looking at so many picassos under one roof. The thought that one man had collected all that art made the museum so much more appealing. Not to be missed",
          "Entry to the Rosengart was included with our Swiss Pass. It isn't the sort of thing we would normally pay entry to, however we were glad we went. The collection of Picasso's, including photos from his life, were very interesting. There are also many works from other well known",

          "It is close to the end of the lake where the Kappellbr\u00fccke is located. The admission is modest and three floors of art await you. Lots of Picasso, but also Klee, Miro, Cezanne and others. Definitely worth an hour or two! Nice cafes nearby for coffee or something more substantial.",
          "A lovely museum filled with Angela Rosengart's collection, primarily Picasso and Klee with representation of Braque, Money, Renoir, Modigliano, and others. The museum is beautifully laid out, elegant and quiet, with plenty of room to browse and gaze at three floors of",

          "One of the best Picasso collections I have seen. Visitors are given a written explanation of the works and history but it doesn't always match up to the order of the paintings. Would much prefer to see the explanations by the paintings. Also a Klee exhibition though I am not",
          "The museum was free with the Swiss Pass but would be worth the 18CHF. 1 1/2 floors devoted to Picasso, about 50 pieces, all in chronological order. A great fee guide talks about him and almost all of the pieces. Another floor devoted completely to Klee, a great Swiss artist.",
          "Picasso is the main draw here, and you'll certainly see plenty of him! Some of the other names on their list really only have 1 or 2 paintings (Monet/Seurat) but still a fantastic gallery that that you don't really expect in a city the size of Lucerne.",

          "My daughter and I love art museums and took our non-museum loving family to the Rosengart Musuem during our short stay in Lucerne. We all loved this little gem of a museum. The very kind receptionist provided us with notes in english to help us better understand the artwork.",

          "Had the whole place to ourselves and Picasso did not disappoint!! I did not get their names, but the two employees who work the front desk and roam the museum, were fantastic!! When my children were doing artwork (copying a PIcasso for homeschooling) they brought them chairs to",

          "This museum is well worth your time to visit if you like modern (post impressionist) art. It has a large collection of works of Picasso and Klee. I did not care much for the Picasso-s (the collection of the Picasso Museum in Paris or the Picasso Museums in Barcelona or Malaga",
          "What an incredible gift to have accidentally run into this place as I was strolling the streets of Lucerne! You'll understand Picasso as a man better than you've ever have before. I've only related to Picasso as an artist until I came here. This place changed my life and will be",

          "The cost was 34.50 swiss francs, which I think is about $40 USD for 2 people. We thought it was expensive for what was there. If you like Picasso, then it might be worth it. They do have a few other artists' works, like Cezanne, Matisse and Chagall, but not many.",
          "This small museum is just the right size to visit in a couple of hours, and we enjoyed the opportunity to glimpse some of the unpublished photos from Picasso's life. It gave us a new appreciation of the man behind the art. We also enjoyed the many other works by different",

          "The presentation and style of the Rosengart is much superior to the main art museum in Lucerne - which had a boxy and impersonal feel. If you like Picasso and Klee you will want to visit the Rosengart no matter what; but even for me - a fan of the Hudson River school - I found",
          "Must qualify by saying I do not love Picasso's work. After visiting this once personal collection, I have seen some pieces of his work that I can now say I truly appreciate and enjoyed. A little pricey, 18 swiss Francs about 20 USD to get in but we showed up at an hour before",
          "The collection is just fabulous. I just love the spectrum of art that is in this private collection and when you hear about the connection the family Rosengart had to the painters it's takes you back in time and kind of makes you part of that history. I especially love the Paul",

          "Worth the visit, the number of Picasso's and Klee's at display is impressive, and the paintings are just amazing. There are many other painters at display (Cezanne, Braque, and many more), with equally beautiful pieces of art. This museum is not to be missed.",
          "A terrific collection, especially strong on Picasso and Klee. Allow at least an hour for your visit. In the Klee gallery, make sure that you pick up a copy of the leaflet that provides a title for every picture, otherwise you won't always know what you're looking at!",
          "We enjoyed this small museum centered around Picasso and Paul Klee. It was close to the train station and free with our Swiss Pass. Had some unusual Chagall works as well. Ms Rosengart visits \" her children\" most days and was there when we were there. The video upstairs",

          "Wonderful collection in exceptional surroundings. Suggest the odd seat though so you could spend a little more time enjoying the work. I really needed a sit down after lots of walking, and would have liked to spend more time.",

        "wiki": "The canton of Lucerne (German: Kanton Luzern) is a canton of Switzerland. It is located in the centre of Switzerland. The population of the canton (as of 31 December 2018) is 409,557.  As of 2007, the population included 57,268 foreigners, or about 15.8% of the total population. The cantonal capital is Lucerne.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe canton of Lucerne comprises territories acquired by its capital Lucerne, either by treaty, armed occupation or purchase.  The first town acquired was Weggis (in 1380), Rothenburg, Kriens, Horw, Sempach and Hochdorf (all in 1394), Wolhusen and Entlebuch (1405), the so-called \"Habsburger region\" to the northeast of the town of Lucerne (1406), Willisau (1407), Sursee and Berom\u00fcnster (1415), Malters (1477) and Littau (1481), while in 1803, in exchange for Hitzkirch, Merenschwand (held since 1397) was given up.\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nThe oldest traces of humans in the Lucerne area are stone artifacts and cave bear bones found in the Steigelfadbalm cave on Mt. Rigi from the Middle Paleolithic or about 30,000 BC.  Other animal bones including mammoth, reindeer and giant deer from the local glacial maximum have also been found in the canton.  Around 17,000 BC the glaciers disappeared from the Swiss plateau and recolonization is likely at that time.\nThe first Paleolithic and Mesolithic settlement discovered in the canton is in the Wauwilermoos, which is now a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  A number of other settlements have since been found, mainly on sandy, dry elevations in the immediate vicinity of water.  The settlements of Egolzwil 3 in Wauwilermoos in Egolzwil, Seematte at Hitzkirch and Halbinsel in Sursee are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The Wauwilermoos houses had wooden or bark floors and hearths of clay.  The villages had ceramic vessels and wood, bone, antler, stone and flint tools as well as textiles.  Copper ax blades and knives provide the first evidence of metal use in Switzerland.  Imported mollusks show that there were trade connections to the Mediterranean.  The bones at Egolzwil 3 are over two thirds from domestic animals with the remainder from wild animals.  The main domesticated animals were sheep, goats and pigs with only a few domestic cattle.  The animals hunted included deer, roe deer, wild boar and elk.During the Bronze Age the canton was quite settled.  There were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Sempach and Lake Baldegg along with hilltop settlements, graves and scattered items throughout the area.  At Hochdorf-Baldegg a fenced village from the early Bronze Age (2200\u20131500 BC) was uncovered.  The single-story houses all had clay or stone hearths.  During the Middle Bronze Age (1550\u20131350 BC) most of the villages were not located directly on the lake shores.  The Late Bronze Age settlement at Sursee-Zellmoos on Lake Sempach featured houses arranged in rows with mortared stone.  The walls were timber lined with clay.  Another Late Bronze Age settlement near the village of Sch\u00f6tz was densely populated between 1350 and 800 BC.\nWhile numerous individual Iron Age items have been found, almost no settlements have been discovered.  From the Hallstatt period (800\u2013480 BC) mainly graves have been discovered.  Very little is known about the La T\u00e8ne period (480\u201330 BC) in Lucerne.  Some iron tools, gold coins, ceramic vessels and a glass bangle as well as a burial ground with at least four graves have been found.\nDuring the Roman era, the canton was once again thickly settled.  A number of farms were built in the north-south running valleys (Wigger, Suhre, Wyna and See valleys).  During the 1st century AD, the farms provided food for the Legion camp in Vindonissa and for the larger settlements located in the Swiss plateau.\nTowards the end of the 1st century there was a vicus at Sursee.  The remains of houses show that there were a number of small shops and manufacturing buildings in the town.  The west bank of the Suhre was fortified with a stone slip and may have served as a ship or raft berth.  Imports from various regions of the Roman Empire (southern Spain, southern Italy, Lipari, southern and eastern Gaul and the Germanic areas) provide evidence of extensive trade relations.  Sursee was likely a freight hub for trade with the entire Alpine region.\n\n\n=== Early middle ages ===\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Roman Empire, the canton of Lucerne was settled by the Alamanni, who generally settled away from the Roman settlements.  Some exceptions include a Roman manor at B\u00fcron and the Roman town of Sursee.  An Alamannic grave field was found at Aesch with 61 graves with wooden coffins from before the 7th century before.  In the women's graves there were necklaces with glass and amber beads, while swords were found in the men's graves.  Belt buckles and small iron knives were found in the graves of both sexes.  A few items from the southern Alpine region, southern Germany and Burgundy indicate that trade continued.\nTwo early medieval stone grave vaults, both of which were used for multiple burials, were found in the church of Altishofen.  In the treasury of Berom\u00fcnster Abbey there is a 7th-century ornate reliquary of gilded copper plates, which probably came from northern Italy.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Lucerne city ===\nLucerne grew up around a Benedictine monastery, founded about 750 on the right bank of the Reuss by Murbach Abbey in Alsace, of which it long remained a \"cell\". It is first mentioned in a charter of 840 under the name of Luciaria, which is probably derived from the patron saint of the monastery, St Leodegar.  The name Lucerrun is first mentioned in 1252. At some point, a small village grew up around the monastery. The first signs of a municipal constitution appear in 1252.\nWith the growing power of the Habsburgs in the area the ties that bound Lucerne to Murbach weakened. In 1291 the Habsburgs finally purchased Lucerne from Murbach.  The purchase of Lucerne by the Habsburgs drove the three forest cantons (Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden) to form an Eternal Alliance, an act that is considered to be the foundation of Switzerland.  In 1332 Lucerne became the fourth member of the Eidgenossen or Swiss Confederation, and the first town to join the rural forest cantons.\n\nThe Battle of Sempach (1386) near Sempach (which while allied wouldn't become part of the canton for 8 more years) drove the Habsburgs out of the region and strengthened the Confederation. That victory led also to the gradual acquisition of territory ruled by and from the town.\nAmstalden, a wealthy innkeeper Sch\u00fcpfheim in the Entlebuch valley of the canton of Lucerne, was the leader of a planned rebellion of the valley against the city of Lucerne. In a plot to limit the power of the city, officials from the neighbouring canton of Obwalden had promised their support. The conspiracy was detected before they could stage the planned coup. On 24 August 1478, Amstalden was arrested, tortured and interrogated, and finally beheaded in November 1478.\nThe incident furthered the distrust amongst rural and urban cantons in the Old Swiss Confederacy and was one of the reasons for the conclusion of the Stanser Verkommnis (Treaty of Stans) in 1481, an important coalition treaty of the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy\nDuring the Reformation Lucerne remained attached to Roman Catholicism, of which ever since it has been the great stronghold in Switzerland. The papal nuncio resided here from 1601 to 1873. In the 16th century, during the early modern age, the town government fell into the hands of an aristocratic oligarchy, whose power, though shaken by the Swiss peasant war of 1653 in the Entlebuch, lasted until 1798. Under the French-supported Helvetic republic (1798\u20131803) Lucerne was the seat of the central government. When the republic collapsed, under the Act of Mediation (1803) it was one of the six \"Directorial\" cantons and during the Restoration (from 1815 to 1848) it was one of the three ruling cantons.\nThe patrician government was swept away by the cantonal constitution of 1831. But in 1841 the Conservatives regained power.  They quickly recalled the Jesuits, who had been expelled by earlier radical governments, to head the cantonal school system.  The riots that followed brought about the Sonderbund War (1847) in which the Conservatives were defeated, the decisive battle taking place at Gisikon, not far from Lucerne.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe canton of Lucerne is part of Central Switzerland. The lands of the canton lie on the northern foothills of the Swiss Alps (Urner Alps).

        "wiki": "Zug (German: Zug, [tsu\u02d0\u0261] (listen); French: Zoug; Italian: Zugo; Romansh: Zug; New Latin: Tugium) is the largest town and capital of the Swiss canton of Zug in Switzerland. Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the Middle Ages it referred to the right to pull up fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\nThe municipality had a total population of 30,542 in 31 December 2018. The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as pile dwellings, on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the Neolithic period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village  'Sumpf'  (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n\n=== Kyburg foundation ===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King Ludwig the German giving the farm Chama (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of Kyburg. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"oppidum\" in 1242 and a \"castrum\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by Rudolph of Habsburg from Anna, the heiress of Kyburg and wife of Eberhard, head of the cadet line of Habsburg.  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg bailiff. The Aeusser Amt or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own Landsgemeinden but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the Habsburg district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n\n=== Joining the Swiss Confederation ===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the Aeusser Amt entered the Swiss Confederation, the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of Schwyz, and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their landammann was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king Sigismund.The alliance of the four forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Lucerne with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of Z\u00fcrich. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks (Walchwil, Cham, Gangolfswil [Risch] H\u00fcnenberg and Steinhausen, and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, \u00c4geri, Menzingen (with Neuheim) and Baar. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n\n=== Growth of the town ===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against Leopold III of Austria and shared in the victory of Sempach, as well as in the various Argovian (1415) and Thurgovian (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 (Walchwil) and 1477 (Cham), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.In 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n\n=== The Reformation and Early Modern Era ===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the Christliche Vereinigung of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.The period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n\n=== Industrialization and internationalization ===\n\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with Nestl\u00e9. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company Landis+Gyr, founded in 1896, and now owned by Toshiba. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nZug is a low tax region, and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is Kirsch.\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, Friedrich Leibacher, shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the Zug Massacre.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of 21.63 km2 (8.35 sq mi).  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, 26.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and 2.5% is unproductive land. In the 2004 survey a total of 353 ha (870 acres) or about 16.3% of the total area was covered with buildings, an increase of 60 ha (150 acres) over the 1982 amount. Over the same time period, the amount of recreational space in the municipality increased by 8 ha (20 acres) and is now about 2.53% of the total area.  Of the agricultural land, 54 ha (130 acres) is used for orchards and vineyards, 651 ha (1,610 acres) is fields and grasslands and 39 ha (96 acres) consists of alpine grazing areas.  Since 1982 the amount of agricultural land has decreased by 74 ha (180 acres).  Over the same time period the amount of forested land has increased by 2 ha (4.9 acres).  Rivers and lakes cover 20 ha (49 acres) in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSee also climate of Lucerne and Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\n=== Weather ===\nZug has an average of 136.1 days of rain per year and on average receives 1,224 mm (48.2 in) of precipitation. It has an average of 5.5 days per year with visibility reduced to less than 1 km, the international definition of fog. The wettest month is August during which time Zug receives an average of 158 mm (6.2 in) of precipitation. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.7 days. The month with the most days of precipitation is June, with an average of 13.7, but with only 156 mm (6.1 in) of precipitation. The driest month of the year is January with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 12.7 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the Town of Zug and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Stadtrat/-r\u00e4tin), each presiding over a department (Departement) comprising several bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (Stadtpr\u00e4sident). In the mandate period 2015\u20132018 (Legislatur) the City Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Karl Kobelt. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Grand Municipal Council are carried by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The current mandate period (Legislatur) is from 2019 to 2022. Any resident of Zug allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz (since 2014). The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Stadthaus (Town Hall) on Kolinplatz.As of October 2018, Zug's City Council is made up of two of FDP (FDP.The Liberals, of whom one is also the mayor), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), CSP (Christian Social Party), and SVP (Swiss People's Party). The last regular election was held on 7 October 2018.\n\nMartin W\u00fcrmli is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiber) since 2014 and presides the Town Office (Stadtkanzlei). He has been elected by the collegiate.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\n\n=== Federal elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2015 federal election the most popular party was the SVP with 25.4% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the CVP (22.5%), the FDP (19.5%) and the SP (17.2%). In the federal election, a total of 9,438 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 55.4%. The 2015 election saw a large change in the voting when compared to 2011. The percentage of the vote received by the SP increased sharply from 6.4% in 2011 to 17.2% in 2015, while the percentage that the GPS received dropped from 21.3% to 9.5%.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nAfter World War II, Zug helped the town of F\u00fcrstenfeld, Styria in Austria. In 1986 they decided to become sister cities.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nZug has a population (as of 31 December 2018) of 30,542. As of 2014, 31.7% of which are foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 11.4%. Most of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (81.8%), with Italian being second most common (3.8%) and Serbo-Croatian being third (3.2%).In Zug about 76% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).Zug has an unemployment rate of 2.28%. As of 2005, there were 172 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 51 businesses involved in this sector. 5,821 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 269 businesses in this sector. 21,445 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 3,205 businesses in this sector.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nZug is a hockey town with the town's main team being EV Zug, which plays in the National League (NL).

In order to advance Zug as a region that is innovating with future technologies, the city council added bitcoin as a means of paying small amounts, up to CHF 200. In order to reduce risk, Zug immediately converts any bitcoin received into the Swiss currency.Zug is a popular location for incorporation of companies, such as Siemens Building Technologies, and Nord Stream AG. Zug has also been referred to as the Crypto Valley by Ethereum co-founder Mihai Alisie, due to the large number of companies engaged in cryptocurrency in the city. By 2018, a Crypto Valley Association had been formed with Oliver Bussmann, as its president.  At the end of 2019, the following were identified as the largest cryptocurrency companies in Zug: Ethereum ($14.4 billion), Dfinity ($2bn), Polkadot ($1.2bn), Bitmain ($1bn), Libra ($1bn), Tezos ($924m),\u202fCardano ($869m) and Cosmos ($818m).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Situation ===\nThe lake shore has been embanked and forms a promenade, from which views of the Rigi and Pilatus, as well as of the snowy peaks of the Bernese Oberland, are gained. Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to St Oswald, king of Northumbria (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a Capuchin convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\nThe Museum of Prehistory Zug houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late Bronze Age (urnfield culture) settlement of Zug-Sumpf. Many of Catharine II of Russia's relatives descended from Zug and became known as the Volga Germans.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug Burgbachkeller, along with the Chollerhalle cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the Zytturm (clock tower), the Huwiler Tower, the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.The IG Culture Zug society currently has some 200 members.\n\n\n=== Heritage sites ===\nThere are a number of Swiss heritage sites of national significance in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the parish church of St. Michael. One archeological site, the Sumpf a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the Burg (Castle museum), Kunsthaus (Art museum) and Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug (Citizen's archive of Zug), Staatsarchiv Zug (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG (Landis & Gyr AG company archives). The rest of the sites are the Catholic Church of St. Oswald with Charnel house, the Seminary of St. Michael, the town walls and several buildings in the old town of Zug.The prehistoric settlements at Oterswil/Insel Eielen, Riedmatt and Sumpf are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Zug education system is based on equal abilities and includes compulsory primary and secondary school, with optional secondary education and vocational training. Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen.

        "wiki": "The Kapellbr\u00fccke (literally, Chapel Bridge) is a covered wooden footbridge spanning the river Reuss diagonally in the city of Lucerne in central Switzerland. Named after the nearby St. Peter's Chapel, the bridge is unique in containing a number of interior paintings dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with a larger part of the centuries-old bridge in a 1993 fire. Subsequently restored, the Kapellbr\u00fccke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge. It serves as the city's symbol and as one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPart of the bridge complex is the octagonal 34.5 m (113 ft) tall (from ground) Wasserturm, which translates to \"water tower,\" in the sense of 'tower standing in the water.' The tower pre-dated the bridge by about 30 years. Over the centuries, the tower has been used as a prison, torture chamber, and later a municipal archive as well as a local treasury. Today, the tower is closed to the public, although it houses a local artillery association and a tourist gift shop.The bridge itself was originally built c.1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications. It linked the old town on the right bank of the Reuss to the new town on the left bank, securing the town from attack from the south (i.e. from the lake). The bridge was initially over 270 metres (890 ft) long, although numerous shortenings over the years and river bank replenishments mean the bridge now totals only 204.7 metres (672 ft) long. It is the oldest surviving truss bridge in the world, consisting of strutted and triangulated trusses of moderate span, supported on piled trestles; as such, it is probably an evolution of the strutted bridge.The Kapellbr\u00fccke almost burned down on 18 August 1993, destroying two thirds of its interior paintings. Shortly thereafter, the Kapellbr\u00fccke was reconstructed and again opened to the public on 14 April 1994 for a total of CHF 3.4 million.\n\n\n== Paintings ==\nLucerne is unique in that its three wooden pedestrian bridges, the 14th-century Hofbr\u00fccke (now destroyed) and Kapellbr\u00fccke and the 16th-century Spreuerbr\u00fccke, all featured painted interior triangular frames. None of Europe's other wooden footbridges have this feature. The paintings, dating back to the 17th century and executed by local Catholic painter Hans Heinrich W\u00e4gmann, depict events from Lucerne's history. Of the original 158 paintings, 147 existed before the 1993 fire. After the fire, the remains of 47 paintings were collected, but ultimately only 30 were fully restored.The wooden boards that held the paintings varied from 150 centimetres (59 in) to 181 centimetres (71 in) wide and 85 centimetres (33 in) to 95 centimetres (37 in) wide. Most of the panels were made from spruce wood boards, and only a few were made from linden wood and maple. The paintings were created during the Counter-Reformation, featuring scenes promoting the Catholic Church. The paintings were sponsored by the city's council members, who, upon sponsoring a panel, were allowed to attribute their personal coat of arms on it. An explanation of each painting was printed below each scene. The paintings ran all along the bridge, dating from the life and death of Lucerne's patron saint St.Leger to the legends of the city's other patron saint St. Maurice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour 360\u00b0 of Chapel Bridge.\nBridges of Lucerne, Official Website, City of Lucerne",

          "KKL Luzern is a new building located close to the river in Luzern, a city in Switzerland. The building is wonderful, especially if you like Contemporary Architecture. In fact, from the upper floors you have very beautiful views of the river, the lake and the old town. We came",
          "What an outstanding experience for visual and oral event. We treated ourselves for the first time at this great and modern venue. There is a large variety of events all year around. Conveniently located only 5 mins. walk from Luzern's main train station and right on the lake.",
          "This is a masterpiece of engineering. The huge span of the roof is interesting and worth a look. Overall the space looks industrial, very clean and stainless steel everywhere.",
          "I absolutely love this concert Hall, KKL. The venue is so nice, clean and chic and they offer a bunch of different events to watch. Personally I have been to an movie orchestra, a general orchestra and a ballet performance and I was never disappointed. Moreover, the sound is",

          "This is one of the most superb pieces of modern architecture I have seen - it is such a credit to the people who run the city. The roof soars high above and extends out a seemingly impossible distance from its supports. It's a thing of beauty you should see close up.",
          "This building stands out on the Lucerne skyline and if you take any of the boats out on the lake you will definitely notice it or walk right by it as you exit the boats. They had some cool fountains out front and was home to a festival going on while I was in town.",

          "If you ever get the chance for a concert, musical etc at the KKL - just do it! The acoustic is fantastic. Moreover the building is extraordinary, modern and well located lakeside, right next to the main station, just 5 minutes walk to the old town. At night the lights give this",

          "Very nice place to sit around and watch out the lake view and mountains surroundings. You could pick some snacks at the restaurants all around.",
          "Although we had the cheapest/less expensive seats there was a good view of the orchestra and the acoustics were sensational. What was very useful was being able to chose and book seats on the internet beforehand.",
          "Although it\u2019s a very modern glass-steel building \u2013 I learned that its architect grabbed an international prize for doing it and I guess that he deserves it \u2013 placed nearby the old town, it\u2019s quite a nice appearance on the lake shore. Very modern, with up-to-date facilities",
          "I honestly saw the KKL in a flight magazine a year or so ago and its architecture captured me so when I had the chance I paid the 2euros and took some coffee and desert that i picked up earlier and went up to the terrace to see the sunset. I didn't have time to visit the",

          "Lots of people, food and beer. We had a great time walking around the building trying local festival dishes and beers.",

          "We loved the Glenn Miller Orchestra show in this very spacious concert auditorium. Our balcony seats provided a good view of the entire stage; acoustics wonderful. The concert was preceded by cocktails in the buzzy bar area. My Singapore sling was the biggest and best ever.",
          "This center houses a superb concert hall, several restaurants and bars, and an number of exhibition spaces. It is situated on the lake next to the train station and the ferry docks. It is terrific place to just hang out, people watch or take in a concert. Designed by Jean",

          "We live here and highly recommend when visiting to take in one of the symphonies. You would do well do book in advance to get the not so expensive seats since Luzerners are crazy about classical music. There is also the option of having dinner with a music. Right now they are",
          "It was good to learn about Swiss culture and about lucerne culture since the city is small place are at walkable distance. Lucerne culture and convention centre was good and about 2 floor. It gave us history knowledge of Lucerne and mountains.",

          "If you want to listen to a great concert, this is the place to go! The acoustic in the building is unique and I even would compare it with operas like in Sidney. Great architecture and right at the lake side.",
          "I attended a conference here and really liked the KKL. It can accomodate large crowds without feeling overwhelming.",
          "The meeting rooms are perfect for all size of gatherings. The auditorium is especially pleasant for large presentations. The conference center location on Lake Lucerne means you can get outside for fresh air on breaks",
          "Not only the interior design, which is engineered for perfect sound quality on every seat, but also the views to the outside are spectacular. At times there are guided tours to demonstrate the high-tech of the concert hall. For example they can open doors to adjust the echo from",
          "Hall is otherwise known as KKL. I saw Diana Krall ( jazz, piano, vocal ) here in November 2012 and the sound quality is clear and amazing. This is a relatively new hall and it has been built and equipped to the highest standards. Good cafe downstairs too.",
          "I thought this buiding was a montrosity. I know they must like a modern cubic architecture but I thought it did not fit in this wonderful town. To me it did not reflect the hsitory or heritage of Switzerland. An eyesore!",

          "We had great comfortable seats for the Vienna Orchestra. The first note made the hair on the back of my neck stand because the sound was so amazingly clear. The acoustics are something that I'll probably never experience again. Ticket price was high at $300 a seat and it was",
          "This is a great venue by a good architect. I think every seat has a good view and the sound is out f this world. There are all sorts of concerts, ranging from classical to ethno.",

          "Nothing to see .Total waste of time and don't even provide toilet facilities",
          "Very modern, minimalist, functional, Swiss facility. We had crappy seats for Diana Krall but still could hear her breathe. Connection to train station brilliant. If artists I liked were playing there again I'd consider the facility a plus.",
          "I like KKL centre so much,a long roof without pillar-its so strange !",
          "Played concert with small baroque orchestra there - acoustic was lovely, warm with good resonance. Also has good restaurant and Seebar overlooking the lake.",
          "Although it's just over 10 years since it was built, the KKL in Lucern is still stunningly outstanding both as a modern building, a perfect concert hall seating almost 2000 people and yielding excellent acoustics to every single one. Spacious and confortable seating is included.",
          "For travelers who visit Switzerland, Lucerne is a definite stop. While the drive from Zurich is an easy one, traveling by train is effortless and allows you to enjoy the natural beauty of the country. The Bahnhof starts and ends at the beautiful, crystal clear lake and the city"

          "We did a boat ride from Fluelen to Brunnen in late October and we were totally impressed by the charm of this part of lake Lucerne. The journey took around 50 minutes and we enjoyed every second of it. It was somewhat similar to experiencing Norwegian fjords.As we had Swiss",

          "This lake is so clean you can see the bottom for some distance as you travel along the surface. Lots of waterfowl from coots to ducks to swans always can be found along the water's edge. Beautiful scenery on all sides.",
          "Ok, this lake is beautiful and all, but honestly the main attraction is that old bridge and that\u2019s it. I walked on the old bridge and experienced the heritage stuff, but it was quite underwhelming. I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t like it, but it was just ok. Nonetheless, the lake is",

          "The lake is huge. We went only on one side of the lake. The water was quite fascinating as it was crystal clear and the lake was very clean. There is boating available for tourists but we did not do the same as we felt it was a little too expensive. You could still enjoy it\u2019s",
          "Beautiful, clean, peaceful; that's Lake Lucerne in three words. The Chapel Bridge is a lovely addition to both the lake (though I suppose the bridge more spans the River Reuss than it does the lake) and the old town, and there are lots of shops and nice eateries around as well.",

          "This was a nice little excursion to spend an hour seeing some of the sites. No frills, and I don't remember any kind of narration of sites, but it was a novel way to get from one side of the lake to the other. We combined this with our trip to Mt.Pilatus.",

          "We took a boat ride from the foot of Rigi mountain back to Lucerne. It was a relaxing and the water was very calm, important for me because I get motion sick (it wasn\u2019t a problem).

        "wiki": "Martin Schmid, also known as Esmid (September 26, 1694 \u2013 March 10, 1772) was a Swiss Jesuit, missionary, musician and architect, who worked mainly in the Chiquitos Province of what is now Bolivia.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nMartin Schmid was born in Baar, Switzerland. He was educated at the Jesuit College in Lucerne from 1710 to 1716. In 1717 he entered the Society of Jesus. His novitiate training was in Landsberg an der Lech, with subsequent theological studies in Hall in Tirol and in Ingolstadt in 1722. After he was ordained in 1726 Eichst\u00e4tt to the priesthood, he obtained permission to travel as a missionary to Latin America. The trip was delayed by the Anglo-Spanish War forcing him to remain in Seville. While he was there, he improved his Spanish. At the same time, he helped to translate the history of the tribe of the Chiquitos of Juan Patricio Fern\u00e1ndez into the German language - Erbauliche und angenehme Geschichte der Chiquitos, und andrer... neu-bekehrten V\u00f6lcker, Vienna 1729, which translates as An Edifying and Enjoyable History of the Chiquitos, and of Other...Newly-converted People.\nAt the end of 1728 his journey to South America commenced. The crossing from Tenerife to Buenos Aires took more than three months. The missionaries needed eight more months to go inland and reach Potos\u00ed, Bolivia. Here Schmid was selected, along with three other Jesuits, to evangelize the Chiquitos.I In August 1730, he finally reached the mission area of the Chiquitos.\n\n\n=== At the Chiquitos ===\nSchmid spent his first ten years between 1730 and 1740 in San Javier, Bolivia, part of the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos. These missions featured houses for the natives spaced along three sides of a rectangle; the fourth side contained the church, workshops and schools. The churches were based upon European architecture adapted to local conditions. Besides his work as a priest, he began to build a music school. He taught the indigenous people to recreate European musical instruments. He also helped to establish a variety of workshops, and introduced several crafts which laid the foundations of later construction activities. In 1744, he sent his first letter home from the Jesuit Reductions settlement of San Rafael de Velasco. Here Schmid established the first of his jungle churches. In 1749 he returned to San Javier, to try to establish a similar church. In 1752 he undertook the construction of the church in Concepci\u00f3n, Bolivia. In other mission villages in the Chiquitan\u00eda region additional structures were built under his leadership. Wood-carved baroque altars were created in San Miguel de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco. How much involvement Schmid or his staff had in the preparation and decoration of the other churches in the ten villages of Jesuit Missions of the Chiquitos, is uncertain.\n\n\n=== Missionary methods ===\nWhen Martin Schmid set out to the mission fields, his primary intention was to evangelize  the indigenous peoples. However his congregation had other tasks for him. His main job was to strengthen the faith of the already Christianized, indigenous individuals and to make their settlements sustainable. The roots of Christian belief were deepened by means of religious education and church celebrations. The Jesuit missionaries felt that this connection succeeded better if more emphasis was placed on the enhancement of liturgical celebrations, as a means of inspiration. For this reason, the music that was loved by the Indians was promoted, and the decoration of the church premises was done in an imposing manner.During the early years building churches and giving music lessons were Schmid's main fields of activity. Within his field of engagement he was also responsible for spreading the making of handicrafts. For the church construction he trained indigenous artisans. As part of his music lessons he taught the indigenous locals to construct European musical instruments.Later, Schmid moved to San Juan Bautista (Santa Cruz) and had the opportunity to engage in direct proselytizing. In a letter to his brother, he described how this was practiced. In the village of San Juan there were already about three hundred Christianized, Indios. They were sent into the jungle to seek nomadic Indians and to persuade them to come to the Jesuit mission. Schmid writes that the villagers who were sent out actually returned after two months with more than a hundred \"unbaptized souls.\" These were then accompanied to the church with music and singing. Schmid first provided them all with simple clothing to hide their nakedness. After that, they were offered food and supplied with small gifts such as: glass beads, rosaries, knives, scissors, etc. The next day the children were baptized. The priests waited to babtise the adults as they first needed to be taught the Christian doctrine.\nThe superiors have ordered me to introduce the music in these missions. All villages now have their organ, many violins and double bass made of cedar, clavicordio, spinets, harps, trumpets, shawm. These Indian boys are foregone musicians; with their singing and playing in the Holy Mass they pay every day the own Thanks and Praise to the Lord. I must say that they could appear with their music in every town and church to your great surprise. (From a letter by Martin Schmid in 1744.)\n\n\n=== Return ===\nSchmid spent his last years in San Miguel de Velasco and in San Ignacio de Velasco, where he was, along with his fellow brother Johann Mesner (1703\u201368), entrusted with manufacturing and gilding the altars. In 1767, the Jesuits of San Ignacio received an order of expulsion by King Charles III of Spain. The 73-year-old Schmid was hoping he would not be affected by the eviction because of his age. Nonetheless, in 1768 he had to start the arduous journey home. With other deportees he crossed the Andes up to Arica, Chile by mule. From there he traveled by boat, via Lima, to Panama. He then proceeded via Cartagena, (Colombia) to Havana, and finally reached Cadiz, Spain in 1769. After a 15-month detention in El Puerto de Santa Maria he was allowed to leave Spain. In mid-November 1770 he arrived in Augsburg. In the spring of 1771, Schmid returned to his home in Switzerland. He spent more than one year at the Jesuit College of Lucerne. He died there aged 77, and was buried at the Jesuit Church of Lucerne.\n\n\n== Effect ==\nBesides his work as a missionary, Martin Schmid made a significant contribution to the enculturation of the Chiquitos Indians. With the introduction of European music, and the manufacturing of musical instruments, he has a significant, long-term influence on their musical culture. He may have helped significantly to impart knowledge of craftsmanship and agriculture. With the creation of a dictionary, he contributed to the writing system and the conservation of the Chiquitano language. However, his most enduring achievements were his churches and their interior decoration.\nThese churches, and the churches of his students, in: San Javier, Concepci\u00f3n, Santa Ana de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco, and San Jos\u00e9 were listed by the UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1990.With his letters Schmid left us a valuable cultural history heritage.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Modern books ===\n Rainald Fischer: Schmid, Martin in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.\nRainald Fischer: Father Martin Schmid SJ, 1694\u20131772.

          "I love history, and generally enjoy history museums, but this one was not well done. It was cluttered and filled with random stuff that was not organized into any discernible pattern. I expect a museum exhibit to tell a story, to make a point of some kind, and preferably to",
          "I like history muesems aa a matter of course. But this seemed to be very crowded. The guide was necessary to get anything but was cumbersome to use",
          "Went in on a rainy day. The museum is packed with different items fruits m different times and themes but they have a lovely game for kids (11, 7) with a prize! Great hour and a half:)",
          "This Museum is cluttered and you are given a scanner to read bar codes that explain the items such as weapons, clothing, pottery, etc but I found it tedious and the 3 floors were very crowded and tricky to figure out which bar code went to each item. It costs $10 CHF on It's own",
          "We spent 90 minutes in the museum. What made it interesting is each person gets a bar code reader and as you looked at all kinds of items on shelves and in drawers with bar codes on each, you can read a short explanation of the item you are interested in. Each person in our",
          "Well first off it's not a history museum. It's actually a warehouse with three floors of strangely curated objects behind glass. There's precious little logic in what goes where - antique shields next to showroom dummies?? - and therefore it's almost impossible to learn anything",
          "We wanted to have a peep into the local history and expected it to be a short trip. But it was unexpectedly exciting and we wish we could have spent more time. The audio scanner guides helped understand a lot about the exhibits. The best part was kids qna guide based on a theme",
          "I benefited from reading the reviews that shared that the museum is not about the history of Luzern. Rather it is a collect of things and that you are given a bar code reader. It felt like wandering thru a museum's storage area and stopping at items of interest except it was",

          "I went to this museum hoping to see exhibits consistent with the name--a museum that would lay out the history of Lucerne. There are bits and pieces of that in this hodgepodge collection, but even with the English audio guide that you trigger off bar codes on objects throughout",
          "This is more a collection of stuff than a museum. If you haven't seen any of it before, it sort of interesting. Otherwise, though, I was not impressed. That said, while the descriptions are in German, the handheld guide has a number of other languages.",

          "It was refreshing to scan the barcodes in front of the exhibits instead of being bombarded by long text. To gain a better insight to certain areas of interest such as the history of Lucerne or the Lion Monument, scan the barcodes for the games at the yellow wall full of barcodes",
          "This museum is PACKED (in a organized way!) with history of Lucerne from like 900 on. Seriously the amount of stuff which is so well organized is a bit overwhelming. You get this little scanner that you scan as many bar codes as you want (corresponds to item) and you can read in"

        "wiki": "The canton of Lucerne (German: Kanton Luzern) is a canton of Switzerland. It is located in the centre of Switzerland. The population of the canton (as of 31 December 2018) is 409,557.  As of 2007, the population included 57,268 foreigners, or about 15.8% of the total population. The cantonal capital is Lucerne.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe canton of Lucerne comprises territories acquired by its capital Lucerne, either by treaty, armed occupation or purchase.  The first town acquired was Weggis (in 1380), Rothenburg, Kriens, Horw, Sempach and Hochdorf (all in 1394), Wolhusen and Entlebuch (1405), the so-called \"Habsburger region\" to the northeast of the town of Lucerne (1406), Willisau (1407), Sursee and Berom\u00fcnster (1415), Malters (1477) and Littau (1481), while in 1803, in exchange for Hitzkirch, Merenschwand (held since 1397) was given up.\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nThe oldest traces of humans in the Lucerne area are stone artifacts and cave bear bones found in the Steigelfadbalm cave on Mt. Rigi from the Middle Paleolithic or about 30,000 BC.  Other animal bones including mammoth, reindeer and giant deer from the local glacial maximum have also been found in the canton.  Around 17,000 BC the glaciers disappeared from the Swiss plateau and recolonization is likely at that time.\nThe first Paleolithic and Mesolithic settlement discovered in the canton is in the Wauwilermoos, which is now a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  A number of other settlements have since been found, mainly on sandy, dry elevations in the immediate vicinity of water.  The settlements of Egolzwil 3 in Wauwilermoos in Egolzwil, Seematte at Hitzkirch and Halbinsel in Sursee are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The Wauwilermoos houses had wooden or bark floors and hearths of clay.  The villages had ceramic vessels and wood, bone, antler, stone and flint tools as well as textiles.  Copper ax blades and knives provide the first evidence of metal use in Switzerland.  Imported mollusks show that there were trade connections to the Mediterranean.  The bones at Egolzwil 3 are over two thirds from domestic animals with the remainder from wild animals.  The main domesticated animals were sheep, goats and pigs with only a few domestic cattle.  The animals hunted included deer, roe deer, wild boar and elk.During the Bronze Age the canton was quite settled.  There were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Sempach and Lake Baldegg along with hilltop settlements, graves and scattered items throughout the area.  At Hochdorf-Baldegg a fenced village from the early Bronze Age (2200\u20131500 BC) was uncovered.  The single-story houses all had clay or stone hearths.  During the Middle Bronze Age (1550\u20131350 BC) most of the villages were not located directly on the lake shores.  The Late Bronze Age settlement at Sursee-Zellmoos on Lake Sempach featured houses arranged in rows with mortared stone.  The walls were timber lined with clay.  Another Late Bronze Age settlement near the village of Sch\u00f6tz was densely populated between 1350 and 800 BC.\nWhile numerous individual Iron Age items have been found, almost no settlements have been discovered.  From the Hallstatt period (800\u2013480 BC) mainly graves have been discovered.  Very little is known about the La T\u00e8ne period (480\u201330 BC) in Lucerne.  Some iron tools, gold coins, ceramic vessels and a glass bangle as well as a burial ground with at least four graves have been found.\nDuring the Roman era, the canton was once again thickly settled.  A number of farms were built in the north-south running valleys (Wigger, Suhre, Wyna and See valleys).  During the 1st century AD, the farms provided food for the Legion camp in Vindonissa and for the larger settlements located in the Swiss plateau.\nTowards the end of the 1st century there was a vicus at Sursee.  The remains of houses show that there were a number of small shops and manufacturing buildings in the town.  The west bank of the Suhre was fortified with a stone slip and may have served as a ship or raft berth.  Imports from various regions of the Roman Empire (southern Spain, southern Italy, Lipari, southern and eastern Gaul and the Germanic areas) provide evidence of extensive trade relations.  Sursee was likely a freight hub for trade with the entire Alpine region.\n\n\n=== Early middle ages ===\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Roman Empire, the canton of Lucerne was settled by the Alamanni, who generally settled away from the Roman settlements.  Some exceptions include a Roman manor at B\u00fcron and the Roman town of Sursee.  An Alamannic grave field was found at Aesch with 61 graves with wooden coffins from before the 7th century before.  In the women's graves there were necklaces with glass and amber beads, while swords were found in the men's graves.  Belt buckles and small iron knives were found in the graves of both sexes.  A few items from the southern Alpine region, southern Germany and Burgundy indicate that trade continued.\nTwo early medieval stone grave vaults, both of which were used for multiple burials, were found in the church of Altishofen.  In the treasury of Berom\u00fcnster Abbey there is a 7th-century ornate reliquary of gilded copper plates, which probably came from northern Italy.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Lucerne city ===\nLucerne grew up around a Benedictine monastery, founded about 750 on the right bank of the Reuss by Murbach Abbey in Alsace, of which it long remained a \"cell\". It is first mentioned in a charter of 840 under the name of Luciaria, which is probably derived from the patron saint of the monastery, St Leodegar.  The name Lucerrun is first mentioned in 1252. At some point, a small village grew up around the monastery. The first signs of a municipal constitution appear in 1252.\nWith the growing power of the Habsburgs in the area the ties that bound Lucerne to Murbach weakened. In 1291 the Habsburgs finally purchased Lucerne from Murbach.  The purchase of Lucerne by the Habsburgs drove the three forest cantons (Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden) to form an Eternal Alliance, an act that is considered to be the foundation of Switzerland.  In 1332 Lucerne became the fourth member of the Eidgenossen or Swiss Confederation, and the first town to join the rural forest cantons.\n\nThe Battle of Sempach (1386) near Sempach (which while allied wouldn't become part of the canton for 8 more years) drove the Habsburgs out of the region and strengthened the Confederation. That victory led also to the gradual acquisition of territory ruled by and from the town.\nAmstalden, a wealthy innkeeper Sch\u00fcpfheim in the Entlebuch valley of the canton of Lucerne, was the leader of a planned rebellion of the valley against the city of Lucerne. In a plot to limit the power of the city, officials from the neighbouring canton of Obwalden had promised their support. The conspiracy was detected before they could stage the planned coup. On 24 August 1478, Amstalden was arrested, tortured and interrogated, and finally beheaded in November 1478.\nThe incident furthered the distrust amongst rural and urban cantons in the Old Swiss Confederacy and was one of the reasons for the conclusion of the Stanser Verkommnis (Treaty of Stans) in 1481, an important coalition treaty of the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy\nDuring the Reformation Lucerne remained attached to Roman Catholicism, of which ever since it has been the great stronghold in Switzerland. The papal nuncio resided here from 1601 to 1873. In the 16th century, during the early modern age, the town government fell into the hands of an aristocratic oligarchy, whose power, though shaken by the Swiss peasant war of 1653 in the Entlebuch, lasted until 1798. Under the French-supported Helvetic republic (1798\u20131803) Lucerne was the seat of the central government. When the republic collapsed, under the Act of Mediation (1803) it was one of the six \"Directorial\" cantons and during the Restoration (from 1815 to 1848) it was one of the three ruling cantons.\nThe patrician government was swept away by the cantonal constitution of 1831. But in 1841 the Conservatives regained power.  They quickly recalled the Jesuits, who had been expelled by earlier radical governments, to head the cantonal school system.  The riots that followed brought about the Sonderbund War (1847) in which the Conservatives were defeated, the decisive battle taking place at Gisikon, not far from Lucerne.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe canton of Lucerne is part of Central Switzerland. The lands of the canton lie on the northern foothills of the Swiss Alps (Urner Alps).

        "brit": "Lake Lucerne, also called Lake of Lucerne, or Lake of the Four Cantons, German Vierwaldst\u00e4tter See, French Lac Lucerne, or Lac des Quatre Cantons,  principal lake of central Switzerland, surrounded by the cantons of Lucerne, Nidwalden, Uri, and Schwyz. The lake is named after the city of Lucerne, which lies at its western end. The lake is most beautifully situated between steep limestone mountains, the best-known being the Rigi (north) and Pilatus (west), at an elevation of 1,424 feet (434 m). The lake\u2019s area is 44 square miles (114 square km); it is about 24 miles (39 km) long, with a maximum width of 2 miles (3 km) and a maximum depth of 702 feet (214 m). Great promontories such as Horw (west), B\u00fcrgenstock (south), Meggenhorn (north), and Seelisberg (south) project into its waters, giving it an irregular shape. The Reuss River enters the lake near Fl\u00fcelen (southeast) and leaves it at Lucerne, and the lake receives the rivers Muota (northeast) and the Engelberger Aa and the Sarner Aa (south).Lucerne, LakeLake Uri (Urner See), one of the four basins that form Lake Lucerne, central Switzerland.\u00a9 Ronald Sumners/Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nUnknown Waters\nHow short is the world\u2019s shortest river?\n\n\n\nLake Lucerne is composed of four main basins (with two side basins), which represent four glaciated valleys, topographically distinct and connected only by narrow and tortuous channels. The most easterly basin, Lake Uri (Urner See), extends north from Fl\u00fcelen to Brunnen, where it meets Lake Gersau (or Buochs), formed by the extension into the lake of the Muota Delta. Another narrow passage between the two \u201cnoses\u201d (nasen) of the B\u00fcrgenstock and the Rigi leads west to the basin of Weggis. This expanse forms the eastern arm of the \u201cCross of Lucerne.\u201d The western arm is Lake Lucerne, the northern arm is Lake K\u00fcssnacht, and the southern arm is that of Hergiswil, which is prolonged southwestward by Lake Alpnach, to which it is joined by a narrow channel.Situated at the heart of the first four cantons of the Swiss Confederation, the lake has numerous historical associations. Lake Uri\u2019s eastern shore is the site of the legendary Swiss patriot William Tell\u2019s leap from the boat in which the bailiff Gessler was taking him to prison (marked by the Chapel of Tell). The legendary meeting place of the founders of the Confederation, the meadow of R\u00fctli, is on the west bank. The Everlasting League of 1315 was formed at Brunnen, and the Hollow Way (Hohle Gasse), the scene of the legendary murder of Gessler by William Tell, runs south along Lake K\u00fcssnacht. Lucerne is the principal lakeside town in a region noted for its summer resorts. ",

        "wiki": "The canton of Lucerne (German: Kanton Luzern) is a canton of Switzerland. It is located in the centre of Switzerland. The population of the canton (as of 31 December 2018) is 409,557.  As of 2007, the population included 57,268 foreigners, or about 15.8% of the total population. The cantonal capital is Lucerne.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe canton of Lucerne comprises territories acquired by its capital Lucerne, either by treaty, armed occupation or purchase.  The first town acquired was Weggis (in 1380), Rothenburg, Kriens, Horw, Sempach and Hochdorf (all in 1394), Wolhusen and Entlebuch (1405), the so-called \"Habsburger region\" to the northeast of the town of Lucerne (1406), Willisau (1407), Sursee and Berom\u00fcnster (1415), Malters (1477) and Littau (1481), while in 1803, in exchange for Hitzkirch, Merenschwand (held since 1397) was given up.\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nThe oldest traces of humans in the Lucerne area are stone artifacts and cave bear bones found in the Steigelfadbalm cave on Mt. Rigi from the Middle Paleolithic or about 30,000 BC.  Other animal bones including mammoth, reindeer and giant deer from the local glacial maximum have also been found in the canton.  Around 17,000 BC the glaciers disappeared from the Swiss plateau and recolonization is likely at that time.\nThe first Paleolithic and Mesolithic settlement discovered in the canton is in the Wauwilermoos, which is now a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  A number of other settlements have since been found, mainly on sandy, dry elevations in the immediate vicinity of water.  The settlements of Egolzwil 3 in Wauwilermoos in Egolzwil, Seematte at Hitzkirch and Halbinsel in Sursee are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The Wauwilermoos houses had wooden or bark floors and hearths of clay.  The villages had ceramic vessels and wood, bone, antler, stone and flint tools as well as textiles.  Copper ax blades and knives provide the first evidence of metal use in Switzerland.  Imported mollusks show that there were trade connections to the Mediterranean.  The bones at Egolzwil 3 are over two thirds from domestic animals with the remainder from wild animals.  The main domesticated animals were sheep, goats and pigs with only a few domestic cattle.  The animals hunted included deer, roe deer, wild boar and elk.During the Bronze Age the canton was quite settled.  There were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Sempach and Lake Baldegg along with hilltop settlements, graves and scattered items throughout the area.  At Hochdorf-Baldegg a fenced village from the early Bronze Age (2200\u20131500 BC) was uncovered.  The single-story houses all had clay or stone hearths.  During the Middle Bronze Age (1550\u20131350 BC) most of the villages were not located directly on the lake shores.  The Late Bronze Age settlement at Sursee-Zellmoos on Lake Sempach featured houses arranged in rows with mortared stone.  The walls were timber lined with clay.  Another Late Bronze Age settlement near the village of Sch\u00f6tz was densely populated between 1350 and 800 BC.\nWhile numerous individual Iron Age items have been found, almost no settlements have been discovered.  From the Hallstatt period (800\u2013480 BC) mainly graves have been discovered.  Very little is known about the La T\u00e8ne period (480\u201330 BC) in Lucerne.  Some iron tools, gold coins, ceramic vessels and a glass bangle as well as a burial ground with at least four graves have been found.\nDuring the Roman era, the canton was once again thickly settled.  A number of farms were built in the north-south running valleys (Wigger, Suhre, Wyna and See valleys).  During the 1st century AD, the farms provided food for the Legion camp in Vindonissa and for the larger settlements located in the Swiss plateau.\nTowards the end of the 1st century there was a vicus at Sursee.  The remains of houses show that there were a number of small shops and manufacturing buildings in the town.  The west bank of the Suhre was fortified with a stone slip and may have served as a ship or raft berth.  Imports from various regions of the Roman Empire (southern Spain, southern Italy, Lipari, southern and eastern Gaul and the Germanic areas) provide evidence of extensive trade relations.  Sursee was likely a freight hub for trade with the entire Alpine region.\n\n\n=== Early middle ages ===\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Roman Empire, the canton of Lucerne was settled by the Alamanni, who generally settled away from the Roman settlements.  Some exceptions include a Roman manor at B\u00fcron and the Roman town of Sursee.  An Alamannic grave field was found at Aesch with 61 graves with wooden coffins from before the 7th century before.  In the women's graves there were necklaces with glass and amber beads, while swords were found in the men's graves.  Belt buckles and small iron knives were found in the graves of both sexes.  A few items from the southern Alpine region, southern Germany and Burgundy indicate that trade continued.\nTwo early medieval stone grave vaults, both of which were used for multiple burials, were found in the church of Altishofen.  In the treasury of Berom\u00fcnster Abbey there is a 7th-century ornate reliquary of gilded copper plates, which probably came from northern Italy.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Lucerne city ===\nLucerne grew up around a Benedictine monastery, founded about 750 on the right bank of the Reuss by Murbach Abbey in Alsace, of which it long remained a \"cell\". It is first mentioned in a charter of 840 under the name of Luciaria, which is probably derived from the patron saint of the monastery, St Leodegar.  The name Lucerrun is first mentioned in 1252. At some point, a small village grew up around the monastery. The first signs of a municipal constitution appear in 1252.\nWith the growing power of the Habsburgs in the area the ties that bound Lucerne to Murbach weakened. In 1291 the Habsburgs finally purchased Lucerne from Murbach.  The purchase of Lucerne by the Habsburgs drove the three forest cantons (Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden) to form an Eternal Alliance, an act that is considered to be the foundation of Switzerland.  In 1332 Lucerne became the fourth member of the Eidgenossen or Swiss Confederation, and the first town to join the rural forest cantons.\n\nThe Battle of Sempach (1386) near Sempach (which while allied wouldn't become part of the canton for 8 more years) drove the Habsburgs out of the region and strengthened the Confederation. That victory led also to the gradual acquisition of territory ruled by and from the town.\nAmstalden, a wealthy innkeeper Sch\u00fcpfheim in the Entlebuch valley of the canton of Lucerne, was the leader of a planned rebellion of the valley against the city of Lucerne. In a plot to limit the power of the city, officials from the neighbouring canton of Obwalden had promised their support. The conspiracy was detected before they could stage the planned coup. On 24 August 1478, Amstalden was arrested, tortured and interrogated, and finally beheaded in November 1478.\nThe incident furthered the distrust amongst rural and urban cantons in the Old Swiss Confederacy and was one of the reasons for the conclusion of the Stanser Verkommnis (Treaty of Stans) in 1481, an important coalition treaty of the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy\nDuring the Reformation Lucerne remained attached to Roman Catholicism, of which ever since it has been the great stronghold in Switzerland. The papal nuncio resided here from 1601 to 1873. In the 16th century, during the early modern age, the town government fell into the hands of an aristocratic oligarchy, whose power, though shaken by the Swiss peasant war of 1653 in the Entlebuch, lasted until 1798. Under the French-supported Helvetic republic (1798\u20131803) Lucerne was the seat of the central government. When the republic collapsed, under the Act of Mediation (1803) it was one of the six \"Directorial\" cantons and during the Restoration (from 1815 to 1848) it was one of the three ruling cantons.\nThe patrician government was swept away by the cantonal constitution of 1831. But in 1841 the Conservatives regained power.  They quickly recalled the Jesuits, who had been expelled by earlier radical governments, to head the cantonal school system.  The riots that followed brought about the Sonderbund War (1847) in which the Conservatives were defeated, the decisive battle taking place at Gisikon, not far from Lucerne.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe canton of Lucerne is part of Central Switzerland. The lands of the canton lie on the northern foothills of the Swiss Alps (Urner Alps). The highest elevation of the canton of Lucerne is at the Brienzer Rothorn at 2,350 m (7,710 ft). \nIt borders the cantons of Obwalden and Nidwalden to the south, Schwyz and Zug to the east, Aargau to the north, and Berne to the west.\nIts territory corresponds to the subject territories acquired by the city of Lucerne during the 14th and 15th centuries, including:\nLucerne proper at the outflow of the Reuss river from Lake Lucerne; \nthe stretch of the Reuss river between Lucerne and Honau, along Rooterberg hill (connecting to Lake Zug with the territory of Meierskappel municipality);\nthe Kleine Emme basin (including its tributaries Entle and R\u00fcmlig);\nthe tributaries of the Aare between Napf and Lindenberg, including  (west to east) Wigger, Suhre (Lake Sempach), Wyna, Aabach (Lake Hallwil, Lake Baldegg);\ntwo territories connected only by water, across Lake Lucerne: the northern slope of B\u00fcrgenstock (part of Lucerne municipality), and the municipalities of Greppen, Weggis and Vitznau on the western and south-western slopes of Mount Rigi.\nThe area of the canton is 1,493 km2 (576 sq mi).  817.7 km2 (315.7 sq mi), about 55% of the total land area, is used for agriculture.  An additional 449.0 km2 (173.4 sq mi) (about 30%) of the canton is wooded.  The remainder of the canton is either developed, 125.3 km2 (48.4 sq mi) (8.4%), or unproductive (lakes, rivers or mountains), 101.5 km2 (39.2 sq mi) (6.8%).\n\n\n== Political subdivisions ==\n\nThe Canton is divided into six districts (Wahlkreise): \nEntlebuch, Hochdorf, Luzern-Land,\nLuzern-Stadt, Sursee, Willisau.\nBefore 2007, the districts were called \u00c4mter. There were five districts until 2013, when Luzern District was divided into Luzern-Land and Luzern-Stadt, the latter corresponding to the city of Lucerne proper (including Littau, incorporated into Lucerne in 2010).\nThere are 83 municipalities in the canton (As of 2016).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Cantonal politics and government ===\nThe Constitution of Lucerne of 2007 entered into force on 1 January 2008, replacing the 1875 constitution.\nWith the new constitution, the legislative body Grosser Rat (Grand Council) was renamed to Kantonsrat (Cantonal Council). It is composed of 120 members elected by proportional representation.\nThe executive body is the Regierungsrat (Government Council), composed of 5 members.\nThe Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP) is traditionally the largest party, having won 38 seats in the Cantonal Council as of the 2015 elections, and having two out of five members in the Government Council as of 2016.\n\n\n=== Federal election results ===\n^a  FDP before 2009, FDP.The Liberals after 2009\n^b  \"*\" indicates that the party was not on the ballot in this canton.\n^c  Part of a coalition with the FGA\n^d  Part of a coalition with the Green Party\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLucerne has a population (as of December 2018) of 409,557.

        "brit": "Lake Lucerne, also called Lake of Lucerne, or Lake of the Four Cantons, German Vierwaldst\u00e4tter See, French Lac Lucerne, or Lac des Quatre Cantons,  principal lake of central Switzerland, surrounded by the cantons of Lucerne, Nidwalden, Uri, and Schwyz. The lake is named after the city of Lucerne, which lies at its western end. The lake is most beautifully situated between steep limestone mountains, the best-known being the Rigi (north) and Pilatus (west), at an elevation of 1,424 feet (434 m). The lake\u2019s area is 44 square miles (114 square km); it is about 24 miles (39 km) long, with a maximum width of 2 miles (3 km) and a maximum depth of 702 feet (214 m). Great promontories such as Horw (west), B\u00fcrgenstock (south), Meggenhorn (north), and Seelisberg (south) project into its waters, giving it an irregular shape. The Reuss River enters the lake near Fl\u00fcelen (southeast) and leaves it at Lucerne, and the lake receives the rivers Muota (northeast) and the Engelberger Aa and the Sarner Aa (south).Lucerne, LakeLake Uri (Urner See), one of the four basins that form Lake Lucerne, central Switzerland.\u00a9 Ronald Sumners/Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nNatural Wonders\nWhat natural wonder of the world is named after aviator Jimmy Angel?\n\n\n\nLake Lucerne is composed of four main basins (with two side basins), which represent four glaciated valleys, topographically distinct and connected only by narrow and tortuous channels. The most easterly basin, Lake Uri (Urner See), extends north from Fl\u00fcelen to Brunnen, where it meets Lake Gersau (or Buochs), formed by the extension into the lake of the Muota Delta. Another narrow passage between the two \u201cnoses\u201d (nasen) of the B\u00fcrgenstock and the Rigi leads west to the basin of Weggis. This expanse forms the eastern arm of the \u201cCross of Lucerne.\u201d The western arm is Lake Lucerne, the northern arm is Lake K\u00fcssnacht, and the southern arm is that of Hergiswil, which is prolonged southwestward by Lake Alpnach, to which it is joined by a narrow channel.Situated at the heart of the first four cantons of the Swiss Confederation, the lake has numerous historical associations. Lake Uri\u2019s eastern shore is the site of the legendary Swiss patriot William Tell\u2019s leap from the boat in which the bailiff Gessler was taking him to prison (marked by the Chapel of Tell). The legendary meeting place of the founders of the Confederation, the meadow of R\u00fctli, is on the west bank. The Everlasting League of 1315 was formed at Brunnen, and the Hollow Way (Hohle Gasse), the scene of the legendary murder of Gessler by William Tell, runs south along Lake K\u00fcssnacht. Lucerne is the principal lakeside town in a region noted for its summer resorts. ",

Exhibits in the museum include stuffed animals, minerals/crystals, and insects. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday and there is a fee for entry.The stated goals of the museum translate as 'presenting natural history information to the public, maintaining and presenting collections and increasing awareness of nature and the environment'.\nThere are three floors and three permanent exhibitions: \"Erdwissenschaften\" (earth sciences), \"Biologie\" (biology) and \"Wunderwelt Insekten\" (the amazing world of insects).Temporary exhibitions have included nature photography and live animals.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere has been a natural history museum in Lucerne since the 18th Century. The original was established by Karl Nicolaus Lange and named Museum Lucernense Langianum. In either 1820 or 1825 the local Gymnasium school established a natural history museum, which was called Naturalien-Kabinett der h\u00f6heren Lehranstalt. In 1848 the contents of another natural history collection from Kloster St. Urban were combined with the Museum Lucernense Langianum, and in 1849 so was the Naturalien-Kabinett der h\u00f6heren Lehranstalt. In 1849 the combined collections were placed in a new museum building on Franziskanerplatz, when their former home was earmarked for demolition, to build a road. 1937 to 1976 the collection became spread across the cellars of the city. The building on Franziskanerplatz became occupied by the kantonalen Finanzverwaltung. The present museum building on Kasernenplatz was built in 1976, and opened in 1978.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "very disappointed with the Natural History Museum. Some very good artifacts, but poor presentation. Some of the presentations should have been binned in my opinion for all of their 'historial' worth. This museum needs a tour guide who can bring the artifacts to life, or you are",

          "What? If you are reliant on just English, this may not be an appropriate attraction to visit. At most, ten per cent of the interpretation is in that language. The temporary CO2 exhibition was of interest, regardless, and the high tech insect display is not reliant on language."

          "The walk along the walls provides beautiful views of the city. If you choose to walk up the towers, the walkway is narrow and the stairs are small and steep. In reality, the views from the walls are about the same as from the top of the tower, so if you are uncomfortable with",

          "We really enjoyed our walk along up the towers and along the rampart walls It's not an easy walk, but it's worth it. The clock mechanism in the clock tower was interesting to watch. The view from the tops of the towers was beautiful. I highly recommend this walk. It's free,",
          "Beautiful views from top of the tower. Has a working clock tower which you can see working from the inside.",

          "Decided to walk part of the walls of Lucerne. After getting up to the entry point a sign informed me that the wall is only open in summer. Disappointed as most of the tourist information and information on Tripadvisor did not indicate it was closed. It was a waste of time. I",
          "Was mistakenly told this would be open, but it wasn't open. Infact it's closed during the winter season. We walked along side the towers, it is a nice walk. Would of been nice to have walked across the top. Next time I guess.",
          "We went to see the Musegg wall and its nine towers which forms part of the historic fortifications. To be honest, it wasn't all that much. It a very nice walking route, but we didn't find almost any explanations on the way, It looked like there are some places along the way you",

          "4 of the 9 towers are open to the public. We climbed 3 of the 4 towers with each tower averaging about 100 steps. And as expected, the upper steps are narrower and harder to negotiate. The views from the top is worth the climb. The central one is the clock tower which shows",

          "We spent about a 1/2 a day making our way along the wall and towers. There are a lot of stairs and at some points they seem steep but they are worth the effort to make it to the top. The views are spectacular of the city and lake.",
          "We were eating at the rooftop of Manora Restaurant when we spied these towers. Curious, we asked the manager, Ms Huber, if we could go up there. She gladly told us the way. Thank God for kind people we meet during our travels! When we got to the towers, we pretty much had the",
          "You can climb the towers and walk the ramparts. One contains a clock, where you can see the workings. There are some signs on the portion closer to the river, but the route is not well marked from the more central portion of town. Great views and a neat hike.",
          "We just happened to come across these towers as we explored the city. It allows a beautiful view of Lucerne. Be sure to climb up to the top of the towers that are open for a special view. The tower with the clock is the most interesting and you can see the workings of the",
          "This is a great site to visit in Lucerne. We climbed only 3 towers, but the one at the bottom has spectacular views and great photo ops. We spent about 2 hours visiting this place, including the time for climbing the towers and soaking in the views from the top of the towers.",
          "Did the towers walk and went up a couple of them. Probably not that wise an idea in 35 degree heat however! I was quite chuffed that I did beat a couple of men quite a bit younger then me to the top of the M\u00e4nnliturm though! That's the one with the little man statue at the top.",
          "We decided to skip any official walking tours, but we grabbed a tourism guide when we arrived in Luzern. I'm glad we did. It had a perfect little train to take that gave us a good sense of the town. Walking along the Musegg wall you really can appreciate this town as a medieval",
          "It is easy to get from tower-to-tower once you go up into the first one. Don't worry. You won't have to go up and down the stairs all day. Enjoy the views!",
          "Our hotel was right by these towers, and we visited all of them. I really enjoyed climbing and exploring the towers and the connecting walkways. Not all of them are accessible to tourists, but those that are are well-preserved and safe. I really liked the one with the old clock,",
          "The walk toward, on, and into the tower was an all out sensory treat. You stroll from Old Town, shops, bars, cafe, through neighborhoods and all of sudden you look up to see these beautiful structures. One of the tower allows you to climb steep steps, around the clock",
          "The towers and wall aren't the first thing I think of with Luzern, but it was enormous fun climbing into some and walking along the wall. So many cities have old towns and are on lakes, but these are unique. Fun for kids and adults, but not for the infirm.",
          "It is highly recommended visiting The Nine Towers. It is just waling distance. You even can walk up to the top of one of towers and view Luzcern. My kids were attracted by the clock tower as it showed all mechanic parts.",
          "Stroll, photograph, think your thoughts along these medieval walls. Great views of mountains, the city and fresh air. Walk part of it on a hot day, lots to see and enjoy.",
          "Beautiful place to visit very quiet in the middle Lucerne. You can walk and enjoy the nature while learning about the most antique watch in Lucerne.",
          "Visiting and climbing the various open towers was a wonderful way to spend an hour or two while in Lucerne. I think that it is very interesting to actually see the medieval methods of protection and communication. There is a section of the towers where visitors can even walk",
          "Be prepared for a little up hill hike to the towers. Once you reach the towers you can go up inside them for a wonderful view of the lake or Lucerne itself. The towers that were open were re-done with new wood supports and nice solid stairs to climb. Take your time and it will",
          "The towers and the old city wall that links them make for a lovely walk just five minutes away from the tourist heavy centre and old town. If you feel that you need a break from the hustle and bustle then this is the best way to spend a couple of hours in peace.",
          "The walk up,the hill to get to the first tower can be a challenge in itself but take your time and enjoy the scenery. Once there there is about 100 steps over 5 levels to reach the top, but again take your time and it is fantastic once you are there. The 360 degree view of",

          "Wear comfortable walking shoes and climb the steps to the top. You go up with a very steep staircase then walk along the old wall to another tower where you climb down again. Nice view of the lake and the city. The old clock in one of the towers is still working and quite",
          "By all odds, Luzern has a lot Towers like this, however, I only could visit this one. The Tower perfectly reflects the history of Luzern city. It is a museum indeed, but the point that liked me the most was that it has a restaurant (medieval decoration) in the upper floor: the",
          "We climbed every one of the towers that are open and were lucky enough to be in the Bell Tower when it chimed! Steep stairs, some almost like ladders, but history to see and feel and then there's the view! You just have to do the walk (and climb) if you are fit and able!",
          "It is most likely a 30 minute walk from your hotel. You also only need to spend 30 minutes there to see the views from up top. Fit in into a time you are shopping in old town anyway.",
          "Can be challenging with the steep slopes and multiple steps up the wall. The towers are well preserved and no entry fees. Stairs within the towers are narrow so only one person can go up or down at any time. Wear comfortable clothings and shoes. The stairs and hand rails are",
          "We visited the clock tower as a portion of the nine towers. The effort made to climb the tower (and the streets around) is well worth it as the views are excellent as are the structures that have been preserved for visitors.",
          "We walked out of the busy city and up onto the walls and made the mistake of not carrying water! It was roasting in the heat and there are a step or two....! Thankfully we did drop in on a funny little cafe towards the end where it drops down to the riverside. High walls, high",
          "We walked to the city wall after seeing the Dying Lion Monument. The wall and towers had a great view of the city. The steps in some of the towers might be challenging and hard to climb for some people. Worth spending the time to see.",

          "The Musegg Wall with its nine towers forms part of Lucerne's historic medieval fortifications. It runs for about 2,800ft. from the north bank of the Reuss River almost to the north shore of the Lake Lucerne. The towers were built in the second half of the 14th century. The clock",
          "We only climbed one, but they are very well maintained and provider great views of the city. The wall seems to separate the old town from modern Lucerne.",
          "We also visited this place where a great view of the town opens for you once you get up. You can walk around and enjoy the quietness.",
          "We hiked and climbed the nine towers. Best views are in the second tower. Be sure to go up in the third to walk the back side of the towers. You end up on the other side of town. There are many steps so be ready.",
          "We found this place by accident, we were just wandering around. It was interesting to see the fort. It was closed for the season so we could not enter any of the ramparts. If you are looking for a good walk, this would be one.",
          "It's a bit of a climb from the town centre on foot, not too tideous though. It's free entry. I believe only two towers are accessible to the public, the others are locked. Walk on the battlements, climb through the two open towers and just take in the beautiful sorroundings.",
          "A nice way to get some exercise while also getting different views of the city. You can go up in several of the towers but not all nine. Be sure to bring water with you if you plan to ascend to the top of the accessible towers.",
          "The towers and old wall are a bit hard to find and best approached from the front! You can walk along the paved pathway then enter one of the towers, climb the stairs and walk along tge wall just as in days gone by. There is a spectacular view from the top of the clock tower,",
          "If you are looking for walk with the town borders visit old Luzern walls. The view from them on town , lake and surrounding mountains is stunning.",
          "Head towards museggstrasse and the wall is easy to find. You can climb up several of the towers and walk along the wall. Everyone seems to go to the clock tower which is beautiful but if you follow the tower along the ground towards the water you'll find the Mannli tower which",
          "We managed the climbing up wooden and stone stairs and we are out of shape. You can only go into three or four of the towers. To think people had to really use these wearing armor and carrying weapons climbing these stairs and I bet they didn't have hand rails like they do",
          "To go up there is so worth it...you have a good view of the mountains, the lake and the whole Luzern really.",
          "It was a lovely walk along the towers away from the crowded old town. The good weather and peaceful setting added to the romance. The tower offers a brilliant view of the lake as well.",
          "The Muesegg Wall, featuring the nine towers, rises high over the city, giving great panoramic views of Lucerne, the Reuss River and the surrounding mountain scenery. We were especially taken by the tower featuring the oldest clock in the city. A stroll through this fascinating",
          "if you want to see the perfect view of the city of Luzern then this is the right spot! be prepared for steep walks but all will be worth it!",
          "Was a great climb up the tower for a spectacular view of lake Lucerne, worth the climb and there are few towers with exhibits. I like the clock tower exhibits and simply enjoy the adventure at the nine towers",
          "The towers are nice to see, and steep to climb. If you can balance your way up, it is worth it in the end.",
          "We found this one totally by accident glad we did. You get great views of the city from the towers you can actually go in. One of them you actually get to see the inner workings of the clock itself. Stairs are steep and narrow up to the clock but highly worth it! The one side",
          "Really interesting wall, it is open every day (even Sundays!) and you get to walk around inside the wall and walk up stairs inside every tower.",
          "So interesting, superb views of lucerne; wear comfortable shoes for the steep steps to climb, not for the faint hearted lol",
          "The towers are easy to find, just outside the city. Nice walk, great views. A must see and do that is FREE. Recommend good walking shoes and water.",
          "An old well preserves tower complex in Lucerne. It's situated on the very top of the town and gives a good view over the whole place.",
          "This is a fantastic place to have a landscape view over the city (on the south side), particularly on a sunny day. You get some great views over Lucerne with the mountains in the backdrop and the sun shining high above. There is a relatively steep climb and set of stairs to",
          "We were able to walk along the top of the walls for one section with some great views back to the centre of town.",
          "A nice way to spend an hour or so. You get some good views over Lucerne and feel like you are miles away from it. Be warned the road up is a little steep and there are a few steps too. It's definitely worth making the effort though, especially as it is so close to the Old Town.",
          "When we were in the altstadt, we took some of the stairs to the north, towards the wall. Found that there is a small section you can walk along on the old city side of the wall. Unfortunately all the towers were closed when we were visiting, but we enjoyed the views overlooking",
          "We accidentally came upon this, it is hidden towards the back of the town, and glad we took the stroll up. There are nice little maps posted along the way to help you guide your way along each tower. Such a beautiful view especially when glistening in the snow!",
          "Lovely walk up to the towers and walls. Great views of Lucerne and Lake Lucerne. Some info available about the history of the walls/towers. All in all very pleasant.",
          "After a morning on a boat trip out on Lake Lucerne, we returned to the old town, had a light lunch, and with slightly improving weather in the afternoon (it had been bitterly cold in the morning...) we decided to try to find a way to walk up through the steep winding streets",
          "Interesting history and bit of architecture but a fairly steep climb from Old Town and withing the towers themselves. Beautiful views of the city, river and lake from the walls if you have no fear of heights. Good photo opps from this site. Railings along the wall are dicey.",
          "A must see while you are in Lucerne. Walk along the walls and climb the towers for fantastic views of the city.",
          "Although we had to walk a slope to the tower, it is really worth to have a look. On the top of the tower, you can enjoy the view of Lucerne. And worth to go up to the tower to see the clock history of Swiss",
          "Thought to be built between the 12th & 13th century it is an interesting bit of architecture and a thoroughly easy and pleasant walk along the base and the top of the wall. You can climb up into 3 of the towers but the best tower to visit is the clock tower (Zyt tower) which is",
          "walking along the top of these towers you have a panoramic view of the city that it a sight to see. Walking through the several hundred years old building is a must its just very intense and interesting to see such building standings .",
          "With great views of Lucerne, but really not much to see. Not a much do and don't try it if you're not in good shape. Steep climb from town. The towers are cool but beyond that not much to do. It would be a good spot for a picnic.",
          "Free little walking tour. just follow the walls and you'll get to climb the clock tower and at the end there is the tallest tower which allows you to catch old town and chapel bridge. Amazing views. Right beside it there is a little farm with cows, pigs, chickens and alpacas.",
          "Lots of steep steps, but worth the climb! Be sure to climb the tower with an open top for great pictures of the city!",
          "This was a spur of the moment choice to hike to for us. We got there, and the views is what sold us was that it was free and the hike. The exercise was a bonus, but I wouldn't go out of the way to go here.",
          "Like many have said, it's difficult to find the entrance - it's not clearly marked. Download Mapsme to your phone and the app can track & display your movement without using any of your data. I would never have found the entrance without a navigation app... and maybe the woman",
          "The views of the city alone make the stairs worth this experience. I am quite certain that if the 9 towers were located closer to the river banks it would be the highest rated to do. This free activity gives you great exercise while stepping you back in time to this old city.",
          "You're allowed to climb to the top of 3 of the towers, but the small windows at the top don't allow for great photo opportunities. It's really interesting to see the architecture inside (especially the middle clocktower), but the best views are from the wall. Behind the wall we",
          "I read about this in Lonely Planet, but trying to find the entrance was difficult and we almost gave up. I am so glad we kept with it because it ended up being my favorite thing to do in Lucerne! It was so cool to walk along the city wall and to climb the towers. You can see",
          "Narrow and steep stairs up the tower; can see how the clock was constructed within the tower. You can capture the views of Lucerne.",
          "Lots of steps to the tops of the towers and you need a head for heights to walk along the top of the wall, but worth the effort as you get some great views of the town below.",
          "It's a walk going upwards, but nice to see the towers from close distance. I couldn't find a couple of them though, but the clock one is beautiful.",
          "Luzern has kept some of its original wall and towers. They are well worth the little effort required to climb those that are accessible. Obviously the views are great and the history inside the Clock Tower is great.",
          "Iconic old city wall featuring 9 towers, some open to the public & offering great views from the top. Good for a walk when the weather is nice. During summer we were able to enter 4 of the 9 towers: Schirmer, Zyt, Wacht and M\u00e4nnli.",
          "Not to be missed! This free walk and tour of several of the tours offers amazing views of Lucerne and a chance to walk through history. The steps are steep and I did it all in sandles(flip flops) but would recommend shoes. the first tower that I entered seemed a bit strange as",
          "reaching this attraction is very easy if you are already in the old town. We have had the assistance of the nice staff from the Victorinox shop, thanks to Rita. once there, you need good legs as there are more than just few steps to take. the staircase is very narrow and very",
          "takes a hike to get there, but the view is interesting and educational. You can walk along the wall and then climb into some of the towers along the wall where you can look over the city and the lake.",
          "The towers provide an excellent view of the city as they are strategically located. You can walk upto the towers.",
          "We have been to Luzern many times, but this is the first time we took the whole family along the old rampart walls. Get inside the clock tower. Easy walk. Good for kids. Beautiful views of the city",
          "We reached the towers late in the day and were not able to see all, but did climb two of them for very nice views of the city.",
          "We spent about an hour walking around the towers and it was a really nice place to view the city. The towers are free :) just bring water because there are a lot of stairs to climb.",
          "Spent some time walking in the old town and along the wall with the towers. The towers that you are allowed to climb up have some amazing views however the stairs are very steep and the floors are uneven so if you have difficulty with this these are no for you. The clock tower",
          "kids had a blast climbing the towers and peak at the city from above. walking atop the wall was a little adventure given the height and narrow path.",
          "The nine towers, properly named the Musegg towers are pretty much all that remains of Lucerne's medieval defensive walls. They are a feature of this lovely city's skyline and some can be visited.",
          "Beautifully preserved and maintained, the Nine Towers present a glimpse into medieval life. There are statues in the tower walls which are fascinating. The internal staircases enabling visitors to climb up into the top of a couple of the towers are steep timber with a hand rail",
          "It was hot and sunny but the walk round the walls and the climb up the clock tower was worthwhile. There were Highland Cows in the field opposite!! the views over the town were good and the walkways well laid and accessible for young and old. Plenty of handrails.",
          "It is not every day one can walk a Medieval Wall that dates back to 1386. Having visited these walls in 1979 and 2016, I always find it a fun activity. If you are conscious of heights or climbing stairs, I would not do this activity. Finding an opening up one of the towers is",
          "We wandered around these towers for ages. We Walked to the top of the clock tower, which would be difficult for the unfit or aged as the steps inside were quite steep. Great view over the old city. Very clean and well preserved. Shady seats along the way to sit and admire the",
          "Found this on our walking tour of Lucerne, couldn't believe access to the top of the tower was free. Not for the un-fit, or fear of steep steps, but definitely worth the burn for the view from the top. Above to see a great perspective of Lucerne.",
          "It's amazing how they managed to preserve a significant portion of the wall and nine towers that once stood guard against enemy forces. 3 or 4 of the towers are still accessible, and gives you a perfect vantage view of Lucern. Walking the wall gives you a sense of nostalgia that",
          "Near the lakefront this piece of medieval history allows you to taste the local heritage. Many steps but inside interesting points of interest- troughs to pour boiling oil, etc.",
          "You should definitely have a look at the Musegg Wall and its towers while in Lucerne. I suggest you start at the Zyt tower to see the clocks, partiularly if you have kids or are a bit unfit. This is truly spectacular and, if you only climb one of the towers, this is the one to",
          "Walking the wall at the top of Lucern gives you an wonderfull view of the town and the montains. It is a tough climb from the town and back up again , but well worth the free trip.",
          "We wanted to go and walk there, but it's very difficult to find. Eventually we found it, but was already closed.",
          "Not for those who cannot do steep stairs up and down. Great views. Old clocks from the city churches.",
          "Magnificent structure dating back to the 1300s. Two towers are accessible and we walked on a walkway between the two. There is a giant clock inside one of the towers., the only drawback is very steep steps - so not appropriate for small children.",
          "So we used the map given to us by our hotel. We ended up starting the walk along the wall on the back side. It was nothing special, or maybe I felt this way because the back side of the wall had the sun beating down on it and I was still jet lagged. Once we got to the front of",
          "We walked up to the towers later in the day and as we were walking the ramparts and enjoying the views of the city of Lucerne and the lake and the Alps---the bells on all of the churches across town started to chime 5pm. It was lovely--like a medieval fairytale.",
          "We walked up to the back section of the wall. Steps lead up a slightly steep path until you reach flat ground and can get a wonderful view of the wall and towers. It is a pleasant walk to reach the clock tower and can go inside to see the workings of the clock. It is also",
          "Very nice spot to see the city and the lake! 2 towers are open to clime up, definitely worth it. Great place!",
          "We enjoyed our time with some good views of the city along with the history of the towers. Clock tower was a new experience where we climbed to the top & could see the minute details on how it worked. The views were an add on. Snippets of historical information were there with",
          "Worth the walk up and climbing the stairs inside the towers to see the views. Check opening times to do this.",
          "The wall is up high, but sidewalk approaches are not steep. Inside, only one tower had a really steep staircase. Photography of the city, lake, and surrounding mountains from this vantage point is outstanding.",
          "It's a lovely hike up the hill. The views are great overlooking Lucern Lake with the backdrop of the surrounding mountain.",
          "We had our 3 year old and 11 month old girls while we traveled Switzerland. The 9 towers were free and fun for the little one to go up and down the stairs (my kids are athletic so make sure that your little one can really walk). I carried the infant.",
          "This is a very nice (and free) introduction to medieval fortifications. It was fascinating to see the towers and walls. A neat highlight is to be in the clock tower when the hour comes.",
          "This is quite an impressive wall and the towers give access to the top, offering great views over Lucerne. Easy to get to with a short (uphill) walk from old town Lucerne. 30-60 minutes will cover it and worth that time.",
          "All of the Nine towers constructed at more or less equal distances between each as a watch tower on the city wall. Not all towers can be climbed and the ones that can be climbed are like a workout. The views from the top of the tower are a consolation for walking the stairs to",
          "I walked over to the towers. As I climbed the towers and then out to walk the towers were closed in many places. I could not see the places I needed to see. It was a wasted trip.",
          "Climbing the towers is a workout, but worth it. The views from the towers and the wall are beautiful. It also houses the oldest city clock from 1535. The best part: it's free!",
          "Visiting the towers in Lucerne is going down memory lane for me. I went to school within their walls and towers and secrets. I visited this time on a rainy day and enjoyed!",
          "If you climb all the towers, it's actually takes quite a bit of work, but totally worth the effort. Best part is they are all free.",
          "It is a must visit place and has very great view from the wall. One cannot realise from the ground that it could be such a good experience.",
          "Not a big fan of heights but the view makes it worth the nervy climb,( quite safe and inside the tower.) At the top there is a great view of the city and lake and in the other direction , a more rural aspect. Walk along the wall between the towers and descend through another",
          "Took me a while to find the entrance so started 1/2 way and had to cling some very steep steps - not my favourite! Then I realise that I suffer from vertigo, so not the best for me.",
          "We walked along the back side (away from the city) of the city walls and I could not resist climbing to the top of the tower with the White Knight on top. There were many steps, but it was well worth it to look way down and wave to my husband, and to get a terrific view of Old",
          "This is located right in the heart of the old town in Lucerne city. A quick accent at the top of one of the towers gives you a breathtaking view of the Lucerne city. Also not to be missed is a set of very old clocks which give you an idea of how complicated the clocks used to be",
          "You can access the wall and towers from a lovely walk behind the wall. I would not recommend going up into the towers for small children as the steps are steep and somewhat open. The views are great of the bridge, river and town. You can also reach this area by a route",
          "This was great fun, yet exhausting, to climb, provides beautiful views. In addition, the walk to it is also very pretty.",
          "It is a walk that is not for everybody. Steep climb up hills to get there but rewarding when you reach it. It contains the oldest clock in Lucerne and the view from the top of the towers is really beautiful.",
          "The walk along the nine towers is picturesque and well worth doing. The walk is not challenging and suitable for all ages.",
          "The climb is long and the stairs are steep. You won't get the view you imagined as the windows of the tower are small and the wire mesh on each window prevents you from taking good photos. You can still get a beautiful view of Lucerne at the base of the tower, though if you",
          "This was a free and enjoyable visit with amazing views of the city below. The only caution I would share is regarding the very steep stairs. If you are unable to do stairs, or are worried about steep, shallow, and narrow stairs, this is not the place for you. However, it is",
          "Visited in autumn 2007. We were so awed by the fort architecture, takes you back so many centuries. The walk over the walls & looking at the few defense systems on display & then walking down into the gardens below. Also loved to see the cattle grazing just near the walls from",
          "The whole concept of a walled city is really cool. We walked up to the towers and had a beautiful view of the city, unfortunately it was hazy out and we didn't get to see the mountains surrounding the city. It still was really cool, and worth the walk up.",
          "So our walking tour didn't take us up onto the wall because he said the views were not the best. He was wrong. The weather was phenomenal and the view spectacular. A good bit of walking and I wore out my companion, but it was well worth it. Make the hike and your effort will be",
          "Today I was in Lucerne with my girlfriend and for the first time I saw a tower on the hill behind the oldtown; we decided to take a short hike and we quickly reached the towers, from which we were able to get a stunning view of the city and the surrounding alps. Although not",
          "Nice wall. If Donald Trump builds one o the US border, I hope he makes it this pretty. After April 1 the towers are open.",
          "When you reach the towers and the wall, you can imagine how great was the city during medieval age. This part of the city walls is very well conserved and it is easily accessed by foot from the old city centre.",
          "It's worth the walk up the town. The views of the wall and towers are grand. It's amazing to see the historical structures still standing after all this time. Reminds me of El Morro in San Juan. It's a good work out to walk up hill, but it's good exercise",
          "The towers are within the walking distance from the town center. Nice views up the tower. Very old and nice clock are still working nowadays in the tower.",
          "Wife and I had a few spare hours, and as these towers are visible from anywhere in Lucerne, you guessed it, wife just had to discover them. After about a 15 minute walk from hotel, we were at the foot of one of the towers. Once at the top which isn't a real hard feat, it is a",
          "Nine towers is definitely a must do/see when in Lucerne. The walk is definitely worth it and is a part of the city walk tour which takes you through Lucerne's many highlights. The view from all of the towers is amazing you get a view of the Swiss alps, the lake, the town and",
          "This is a great activity when in Lucerne. Walk along the medieval ramparts and visit some of the watch towers. The view of the city, Lake Luzern, Mt Pilatus and the other mountains is spectacular.",
          "Walking along the walls and climbing the towers was a lot of fun. The views from the towers were impressive. You could really get see the old bridges and old town. The clock tower was our favorite. We happened to be at the top of the tower when the bell rang. ( It rings just",
          "The clock tower, the wall, the towers are worth the hike up by the historic area. It is a bit of a walk but we felt it was worth seeing Luzern from this vantage point and walking along a wall built so long ago",
          "When we went these towers were pretty quiet. We still ran into other visitors, but it didn't have the enormous crowds other areas of Lucerne has. I don't want to gloss over the point of the towers either, they were very interesting with several old clocks in one and nice views",
          "Part of the second fortifications of Lucerne. Clearly shows how the fortifications were built and the defences of the city. Some of the wall can be walked along and four of the towers are open to the public to ascend and obtain some great views. The tower with the clock in it,",
          "It is a bit of an uphill hike and there are of course many stairs to reach the top of each tower but the views over the city are very nice.",
          "If you're up for a hike, this is one. It' well worth the exercise. It was just nice to be able to reach the top of the tower and see the lovely view of Old Town Lucern, the lake, and Swiss Alps. Go on a clear day and you'll enjoy the trek!",
          "Enjoyed walk along the walls and climb up the clock tower. Lovely views over Lucerne which would have been even better if it had not been a dull cloudy day.",
          "You'll huff and puff getting up to the tower which is entry point to walk the walls and experience some of the best views of the old town and the River Reuss. But the exercise is well worth it. Getting back down to the riverside is also a challenge as the walkway is steep and",
          "Interesting attraction that puts the history of Luzern as a walled town into perspective. We particularly enjoyed climbing up several towers, and the restored clock tower was our favorite. Some of the towers were a bit neglected, but overall its worth a trip, even if just for",
          "While we enjoyed this, it is not for anyone with bad legs. The best part is the view you'll get from the towers, which offer great views across Lucerne. This would be very taxing for those not in shape or light on their feet. The steps up the towers are narrow, steep, and there",
          "Just a great city to visit. Romantic, beautiful, clean, etc. We will come back! The Ameron Hotel was very good! I had written down that the reception staff was not friendly at all but I would like to specify that not all of them were like that. Two people, a girl and the",
          "Good to get there and imagine how soldiers once attacked others on the wall. Climb higher to the tower and get good pictures of the city!",
          "Weird, but I had been in Lucerne several times before I discovered this gem. One day, I just took off up the hill with my camera and suddenly there it was! It's a fascinating bit of Swiss history and a testament to the folks who have worked hard to maintain the wall and the",
          "The old city walls are unbelievably well-preserved, there are great views, and you can walk up a few of the towers. One of the towers has a great selection of huge old clocks.",
          "Get ready to hick some stairs but it is worth it. The view from the last tower or first depending on which way you start is the best. Just loved it.",
          "The walls with tower surround the old town center from the other side than the lake does. The walk along the tops of fortification walls offer nice views and a pleasant walk beyond the crowds in the downtown. And there towers that can be climbed (for free) are a bonus.",
          "history again! It is amazing these medieval towers still stand. It was very hot the day we were there, so I did not linger...",
          "It's right at the top of the old city, easy walk there. I found it a bit lacking. It's probably ok if you have the time, but otherwise I think that it's ok to miss it if you only have one day in Luzern.",
          "Be in the bell tower at high noon for a real treat\ud83d\ude49 The surrounding gardens and yak filled pastures are very lovely.",
          "The old wall is a piece of history and a must visit in Luzern. The towers are a bit of climb but the view from the top justifies the effort. I climbed up all the towers and they all have different views to offer and all of tehm are very beautiful.",
          "The walls and towers are a significant part of the history of Lucerne with, as you would expect, great views of the surrounding landscape. They are a little hard to get to as the climb is steep and they are not as close as the first view from the old town suggests. Plenty of",
          "I'm always looking for a way to get some strenuous exercise in while on vacation and hiking in this area and climbing the towers is a fun way. Plus, you will learn a little history. And...it's free.",
          "You get some of the best panoramic views from the towers. Not very easy with small children or elderly folks due to the number of stairs and if our go up the tower it becomes quite dangerous for them. If you can make it though I recommend you climb to the top of the bell tower",
          "Great sight to see from a historical point of view. Bit of a climb up to it and when inside the stairs up to the ramparts are quite steep",
          "I enjoyed walking up and through and along these towers. It is free to the public and offer great views of the city and lake.",
          "Some climbing and quite narrow passageways, so take note of it if you are scared of heights or confined spaces. Other than that, you will be rewarded with awesome views. Make sure to check out the clock tower as you are able to view the inner workings of it.",
          "We really enjoyed visiting the ramparts and walking over the walls. We saw some incredible views and came across a wonderful little restaurant called Hinter Musegg where they've got cold beer, and a little farm!",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Before we went I printed off a short paragraph about each of the towers (a PDF called 'the towers of lucerne' off luzern.com) which provided some interesting information as there aren't many signs on the towers. You can climb up three of them and walk",
          "This one is at the end of the wall closest to the river. I think a lot of people stop after the first couple. DO THIS ONE!...first It is totally open at the top and the views of the city and lake are spectacular!!!",
          "Others have said the wall was hard to find but I didn't think so - it's a wall!!!! It's also very obvious the way it nonchalantly winds across alleys and behind houses. Climbing the towers gets you up on top of the wall which is pretty narrow but gives great views of the city.",
          "Fantastic views of the city and a little flavor of what the city was like when a fortress wall encircled the core. Starting at the river end and walking along is great exercise and the views are stunning of the lake and farmlands around Lucerne. Make sure you hit each tower",
          "This is part of a great walking tour around the city, make sure you have comfy shoes on and are prepared for steps - lots of steps! Once you reach the top of each tower the views are amazing and a great place to catch your breath before you tackle the next tower. A fun day",
          "This is a place that will give you a workout! :) There are 4 different towers that you can climb. Each one has many stairs leading to the top. It has great views of the city. It's out of the way to find- we started at the Lion statue and then made our way over to it. Worth the",
          "This is one of the things they don't tell you about on a tour. We went over the chapel bridge then up to the Zyt clock tower. We climbed it (the views are pretty good, and the clock is pretty neat), then we walked along the wall down and a few block to the lion monument then",
          "Free experience to walk up into the old medieval towers and along the old wall. There are great views of the city. The starting point is somewhat near the old town, but you'll near to do some work to find it.",
          "It's just one of those things you have to do when you're here. It's free and you can't miss them. You can climb around the towers and ramble along the walls. It's easy and fun. And has great views over the town and of the mountains.",
          "It is situated behind the main shopping area..Had to walk a lot to reach there..After reaching there, we dint find much of people around. Also, travelling into each tower is tiring, and after going to the last tower, we had to come all the way to the first tower to get out of",
          "Do it if you have time. If not go for the old city, the bridge and the river banks. Do not miss the cruise on Lake Luzerne",
          "The towers were the only thing I experienced in the city that I would consider just average and not excellent. The views are really nothing to speak of, just tiny windows with wiring around the openings and a steep climb for an anticlimactic view. There are many other spots to",
          "Enjoyed a walk fro the Chapel Bridge to the towers and were well rewarded with breathtaking views of the lake, the city and Mount Pilatus. Not the easiest of walk as it is a slow uphill walk followed by a number of stairs in the tower but well worth it. You get a great vantage",
          "Such a pleasant surprise! The up hill walk was well rewarding, once you are at the top the view is amazing...even on a rainy day:)",
          "I found this to be the most interesting attraction in Lucerne. but not many people visit there compare to the Dying Lion Monument and the Chapel Bridge because it's up in the hill and its does take 2 hours to see all 9 towers but it's worth it. Go up to the hill and check them",
          "This was closed in october but I took the back path up to the back side and mich to my delight found lots of pretty views and things to enjoy.",
          "Very disappointed that the nine towers and the walk along the old wall is closed during winter. I was looking forward to this, so was very disappointed that it was closed. We walked along the wall for a while and were amazed by the size of the wall and towers.",
          "Nice place to visit for someone who wants to hike through historic towers. the view of the city from the towers are amazing.",
          "The walls and towers are part of the medieval town defenses. They are well maintained and provide great views of the town and surrounding countryside.",
          "It does take a little effort to walk and climb a couple of the open towers on this historic wall, but well worth the effort. We walked over to the wall from the Lion monument. On one side of the wall you can see how imposing the wall was to outsiders. Looking toward the town",
          "Enjoyed scouting out the various towers. Fun yet very steep and narrow staircases inside. Nice views of Lucerne. Well preserved. Nice to imagine the historical aspect of this modern city.",
          "I think it is amazing they have survived all this time. I walked from MIl Bridge and despite some very small signage I still had a problem finding the actual entrance to the wall via the towers. The views are OK but not outstanding and I thought there had been almost too much",
          "I just love everything that shows the ancient side of a place, especially if it resembles the Middle Ages, which I'm fascinated about. So, the towers were one of my favorite places in Lucerne. You can go up most of them, seeing the city from above, walk the city walls, and climb",
          "We walked up to the 9 towers, which was part of the old city wall, after we crossed the Mill bridge. It was about 15 minutes hike to reach the base of the city wall. The top of the city wall could be reached via stairs via the clock tower as well as other watch towers. One",
          "This was pointed out and described to us by our wonderful guide from tourism, so after our tour, we walked up and went though a few towers until my fear of heights got the best of me. Wonderful history and nice that it's free.",
          "This was neat to see. You can walk along the wall for a bit. There is some info on clock making and you can see some of the clocks in operation (you can see the internals working) which was cool.",
          "During the summer seasons you can walk along the wall and climb some of the towers. It's great! but kind of steep to.",
          "You don't find city walls this accessible and intact very often in Europe. We greatly enjoyed the hike.",
          "What an excellent time away from the city. These unique towers are joined together with a wall-walk. Some of the towers have inner stairs where you can climb up them for some spectacular views of Lucerne. You will also see of the Switzerlands oldest clocks & there are many",
          "Walked up the hill and the stairs and saw a great view from two of the towers - one with the clock, and walked across the walls (very high - I would not recommend it to people who do not like it as me :D)",
          "Although you can see where they are on a map we didn't fin d it so easy to find the starting point, maybe we were too puffed and short of time to pay proper attention. Well worth visiting if just for the views and to say you have done it. Be prepared for an uphill walk to",
          "You are able to walk up and through three of the nine towers that form part of the old city wall. The views are breathtaking!",
          "We walked through this area on a lovely sunny day, and enjoyed it very much, we returned to the town along the river, and then stopped for lunch in a lovely area nearby. Well worth the visit.",
          "Good exercise, wonderful views. The kids enjoyed climbing up and seeing the views as well. Only a few of the towers were open while we were there but it was still a very enjoyable time.",
          "This is the remains of the old wall surrounding the city. Yes, it's a steep walk uphill to get there but worth the effort. We started from the western (river) end, entered and climbed up the second tower which brings you out on to the ramparts and an elevated walkway. Proceed",
          "We have enjoyed exploring the towers and walking the wall and trails behind the wall on many visits to Lucerne. We always begin our walk on the path that starts nearest the River Reuss. Our entry to the path is near where St. Karli-Quai and Bruggligasse merge. The path is a bit",
          "Have been through the old town all by foot and this place was quite boring. If it weren't so sunny I may have enjoyed it. Visited in 2008.",
          "I really enjoyed walking the grounds of the Nine Towers and then going up along the fortress walls. One of the towers has Swiss clock works from centuries ago that are truly amazing. You can walk to the top of the tower and look out over the city and surrounding mountains. It",
          "It a nice steep hill walk from old city of Lucerne. You can easily spend 2 hrs just walking through this Nine Towers. You get the better view of city from the top",
          "I loved the true \"castle\" feel of the wall and towers. Also, being able to see the inner workings of the clocks from the pendulum to the gears is fascinating! I loved telling my kids about \"Swiss precision,\" and how they managed to put what is 40 feet large in this tower onto",
          "I was mystified by earlier reporters saying the walls were hard to finsd and difficult to navigate - I could see them easily on the map and from close to my hotel above the old town. Having found them and walked their length, I now kno0w what those reporters meant. They are",
          "There are much better city walls in many other places. Here, the city walls are 2nd tier, and a bit harder than average to reach, and closed at both ends, and the views are simply not all that spectacular. It took some effort to do this attraction for not very much payoff.",
          "only two towers are open. and both ends are closed. it's hard to find, but once you get up, the views are amazing from one of the towers only. unfortunately big trees block the views from the other tower and the high parts of the wall. great to do though.",
          "The walk up to the remaining remnants of the city wall is a bit steep, but worth it for the views. One of the towers is a museum to the clocks of the city and a number of the old clock mechanisms from clocks around the town are on display, some still working. You can climb this",
          "The view from the Lake Cruise points out the nine towers along the skyline - very interesting, and one of the many things to see in Lucerne",
          "We really enjoyed experiencing these towers. It is a bit of a hike but well worth it. The towers are really interesting. Be aware that there are lots of steep stairs when you go up inside. But the views along the wall are spectacular.",
          "The wall is one of the things you can stop by while going around Old Town, being just a short walk away from all the shops and cafes. Climb up to the wall and walk along it to get a different view of Lucerne, and the inside of the towers are also quite interesting, particularly",
          "The walk of the wall and towers in Lucerne is worth it for the visit to the Zytturm (the Clock Tower). There is a museum of sorts inside this tower that houses a collection of old clocks and clockworks. The view from the top of the tower is great. Make sure to check out the",
          "Like others mentioned, the clock tower is especially fascinating! And being on the walkway on the walls provides views of the city you cannot find elsewhere. At the time of this review, two of the towers are closed due to renovation work going on and only 4 open to the public.",
          "Yes this is the old city wall and guard towers but they provide a great view of the lake and city. The clock tower is especially worthwhile with several historic clocks in operational order. The walk along the top of the tower is quite high and the steps up the towers seem a",
          "Just a plain wall with lot of walking and climbing. Didn't find it worth visiting. Waste of time walking on the wall.",
          "Wonderful views of Lucerne from the connecting walk up along the towers. Only 2 were open to us; 2 were having work done on them. Of the 9 Towers, normally there are 4 open to the public. No charge.",
          "We enjoyed our walk to the City Wall and the climb up into the Tower. We were rewarded with an awesome view of the entire city.",
          "The nine towers are part of the old city wall of Lucerne that dates back to Roman times. They are worth a visit, but you need to be in good shape to be able to walk up a steep hill and several levels of stairs. You can access the actual wall at three towers, and walk along the",
          "This was a really fun walk and gave you great views of the city! You should start at the tower that is next to the river and work your way across and you'll end up in the old town.",
          "We wanted to take in the view of Luzern that the tower presented but we disappointed when we discovered that they were closed until Easter (April). Otherwise it is still worth a quick visit as they are still interesting from ground level.",
          "Well worth the climb through the picturesque old town to see the wall and towers up close. We were especially pleased to discover the huge wall painting of the Wilden Mann which was the name of the hotel where we were staying. It was a clear bright day and from the height we had",

          "This was a little off the beaten path from what our travel guides recommended but we were so glad we made our way out to see it. Recommend climbing the second tower from the east to get a great view. Stairs are very narrow and steep, so be careful. After that, walk along the",

          "We walked around the west end of the wall, up a asphalt path to the 3rd tower. In the heat it was a pretty good walk. You go down underground to get up the tower. The stairs are steep. The view on top is terrific. You can then walk further on the path besides a grade school",

          "There is an extreme amount of walking and due to restoration only 3 of the towers were open. One tower is extremely steep, lots of narrow stair,I would not take small children. The clock tower was very interesting to see all the elements that make it work. In total, the view",

          "Not especially difficult to reach. OK, it stands at the upper side of the town and you'll have to go through some steps, but it ain't that hard. You will be rewarded with a perfect view of the town. Please, don't miss the last tower. You will be able to climb to the top of the",

          "This 14th century structure is rather fascinating and takes some work to find and follow, but it's worth it if you're up to it. Be ready to walk and climb and make sure you have a good map that you can follow. Parts of the area through which the wall passes have evolved as if",

        "wiki": "Lucerne ( loo-SURN, French: [lys\u025b\u0281n]; German: Luzern [lu\u02c8ts\u025brn] (listen); Lucerne German: Loz\u00e4rn; Italian: Lucerna [lu\u02c8t\u0283\u025brna]; Romansh: Lucerna [lu\u02c8ts\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name. With a population of approximately 82,000 people, Lucerne is the most populous town in Central Switzerland, and a nexus of economics, transportation, culture, and media in the region. The city's urban area consists of 19 municipalities and towns with an overall population of about 220,000 people.Owing to its location on the shores of Lake Lucerne (German: Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee) and its outflow, the river Reuss, within sight of the mounts Pilatus and Rigi in the Swiss Alps, Lucerne has long been a destination for tourists. One of the city's famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge (German: Kapellbr\u00fccke), a wooden bridge first erected in the 14th century.\nThe official language of Lucerne is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and founding (750\u20131386) ===\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire beginning in the 6th century, Germanic Alemannic peoples increased their influence on this area of present-day Switzerland.\nAround 750 the Benedictine Monastery of St. Leodegar was founded, which was later acquired by Murbach Abbey in Alsace in the middle of the 9th century, and by this time the area had become known as Luciaria.The origin of the name is uncertain, it is possibly derived from the Latin name of the pike, lucius, thus designating a pike fishing spot in the river Reuss. Derivation from the theonym Lugus has been suggested but is phonetically implausible. In any case, the name was associated by popular etymology with Latin lucerna \"lantern\" from an early time.In 1178 Lucerne acquired its independence from the jurisdiction of Murbach Abbey, and the founding of the city proper probably occurred that same year. The city gained importance as a strategically located gateway for the growing commerce from the Gotthard trade route.\nBy 1290, Lucerne had become a self-sufficient city of reasonable size with about 3000 inhabitants. About this time King Rudolph I von Habsburg gained authority over the Monastery of St. Leodegar and its lands, including Lucerne. The populace was not content with the increasing Habsburg influence, and Lucerne allied with neighboring towns to seek independence from their rule. Along with Lucerne, the three other forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed the \"eternal\" Swiss Confederacy, known as the Eidgenossenschaft, on November 7, 1332.\nLater the cities of Z\u00fcrich, Zug and Bern joined the alliance. With the help of these additions, the rule of Austria over the area came to an end. The issue was settled by Lucerne's victory over the Habsburgs in the Battle of Sempach in 1386. For Lucerne this victory ignited an era of expansion. The city shortly granted many rights to itself, rights which had been withheld by the Habsburgs until then. By this time the borders of Lucerne were approximately those of today.\n\n\n=== From city to city-state (1386\u20131520) ===\nIn 1415 Lucerne gained Reichsfreiheit from Emperor Sigismund and became a strong member of the Swiss confederacy. The city developed its infrastructure, raised taxes, and appointed its own local officials. The city's population of 3000 dropped about 40% due to the Black Plague and several wars around 1350.\nIn 1419 town records show the first witch trial against a male person.\n\n\n=== Swiss-Catholic town (1520\u20131798) ===\n\nAmong the growing towns of the confederacy, Lucerne was especially popular in attracting new residents. Remaining predominantly Catholic, Lucerne hosted its own annual passion play from 1453 to 1616, a two-day-long play of 12 hours performance per day. As the confederacy broke up during the Reformation, after 1520, most nearby cities became Protestant, but Lucerne remained Catholic. After the victory of the Catholics over the Protestants in the Battle at Kappel in 1531, the Catholic towns dominated the confederacy. It was during this period that Jesuits first came to Lucerne in 1567, with their arrival given considerable backing by Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. The region, though, was destined to be dominated by Protestant cities such as Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Basel, which defeated the Catholic forces in the 1712 Toggenburg War. The former prominent position of Lucerne in the confederacy was lost forever. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wars and epidemics became steadily less frequent and as a result the population of the country increased strongly.\nLucerne was besieged by a peasant army and quickly signed a peace treaty with the rebels in the Swiss peasant war of 1653.\n\n\n=== Century of revolutions (1798\u20131914) ===\n\nIn 1798, nine years after the beginning of the French Revolution, the French army marched into Switzerland. The old confederacy collapsed and the government became democratic. The industrial revolution hit Lucerne rather late, and by 1860 only 1.7% of the population worked in industry, which was about a quarter of the national average at that time. Agriculture, which employed about 40% of the workers, was the main form of economic output in the canton. Nevertheless, industry was attracted to the city from areas around Lucerne. From 1850 to 1913, the population quadrupled and the flow of settlers increased. In 1856 trains first linked the city to Olten and Basel, then Zug and Z\u00fcrich in 1864 and finally to the south in 1897.\nThe 1804 play William Tell by Friedrich Schiller did much to establish the reputation of Lucerne and its environs. Schiller himself had not been to Lucerne, but was inspired to write the play by his wife Lotte and his friend Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had both personally visited the city and its surrounding canton. Goethe had lodged in the Hirschenplatz on his route to Italy in 1779.It was during the latter part of the 19th century that Lucerne became a popular destination for artists, royalty and others to escape to. The German composer Richard Wagner established a residence at Tribschen in 1866 from which he lived and worked. The city was then boosted by a visit by Queen Victoria to the city in 1868, during which she went sightseeing at the Kapellbr\u00fccke and Lion Monument and relished speaking with local people in her native German. The American writer Mark Twain further popularised the city and its environs in his travel writings after visiting twice, in 1878 and 1897. In 1892 Swiss poet and future Nobel Prize laureate Carl Spitteler also established himself in Lucerne, living there until his death in 1924.Lucerne's status as a fashionable destination led to it becoming one of the first centres of modern-style tourism. Some of the city's most recognisable buildings are hotels from this period, such as the Schweizerhof Hotel (1845), Grand Hotel National (1870), and Ch\u00e2teau G\u00fctsch (1879). It was at the National that Swiss hotelier C\u00e9sar Ritz would establish himself as manager between 1878 and 1888.\n\n\n=== 20th and 21st century ===\n\nIn August 1993, the Kapellbr\u00fccke in the centre of the city suffered from a great fire which destroyed two thirds of its interior paintings. The bridge was subsequently reconstructed and reopened to the public in April 1994, after a total of CHF 3.4 million was spent on its repair.On June 17, 2007, voters of the city of Lucerne and the adjacent town of Littau agreed to a merger in a simultaneous referendum. This took effect on January 1, 2010. The new city, still called Lucerne, has a population of around 80,000 people, making it the seventh-largest city in Switzerland. The results of this referendum are expected to pave the way for negotiations with other nearby cities and towns in an effort to create a unified city-region, based on the results of a study.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLucerne is located at the outfall of Lake Lucerne into the river Reuss, which flows from south-east to north-west. The city occupies both banks of the river and the lowest reach of the lake, with the city centre straddling the river immediately downstream of the outfall. The city's suburbs climb the hills to the north-east and south-west, and stretch out along the river and lake banks, whilst the recently added area of Littau is to the north-west.Besides this contiguous city area, the municipality also includes an exclave on the south shore of Lake Lucerne some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) away, comprising the northern slopes of the B\u00fcrgenstock. This section of the municipality is entirely surrounded by the lake and by land of the canton of Nidwalden. It does not contain any significant settlements, but the summit of the B\u00fcrgenstock is the highest point of the municipality.The municipality has an area of 29.1 square kilometers (11.2 sq mi). Of this area and as of 2009, 28.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 47.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (2.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBetween 1961 and 1990 Lucerne had an average of 138.1 days of rain per year and on average received 1,171 mm (46.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month was June during which time Lucerne received an average of 153 mm (6.0 in) of rainfall. During this month there was rainfall for an average of 14.2 days. The driest month of the year was February with an average of 61 mm (2.4 in) of precipitation over 10.2 days. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the city of Lucerne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (German: Stadtrat/-r\u00e4tin), each presiding over a directorate (Direktion) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (Stadtpr\u00e4sident). In the mandate period (Legislatur) September 2016 \u2013 August 2020 the City Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Beat Z\u00fcsli. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Grand City Council are carried by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Lucerne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate.As of September 2016, Luzern's City Council is made up of one representative of the SP (Social Democratic Party, who is also the mayor), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GPS (Green Party), FDP (FDP.The Liberals), and glp (Green Liberal Party). The last regular election was held on 1 May/5 June 2016.\n\nToni G\u00f6pfert (FDP) is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiber) since 1990.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Grand City Council (Grosser Stadtrat) holds legislative power. It is made up of 48 members, with elections held every four years. The Grand City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the Grand City Council are public. Unlike members of the City Council, members of the Grand City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Luzern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Grand City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Rathaus (Town Hall) am Kornmarkt.The last regular election of the Grand City Council was held on 1 May 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur) from September 2016 to August 2020. Currently the Grand City Council consist of 13 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS) and one of its junior section, the JUSO, 9 The Liberals (FDP/PLR), 7 Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 7 Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), 6 Green Party (GPS/PES) and one of its junior section, the jg of Luzern, and 4 Green Liberal Party (GLP/PVL).\n\n\n=== National elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 25.0% (-0.7) of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the Green Party (20.8%, +7.4), the SVP (15.0%, -4.6), the CVP (14.1%, 0), FDP (13.0%, -2.5), the glp (10.5%, +1.8).

There were only 74 single story buildings and 1,721 four or more story buildings.\n\n\n=== Historic population ===\nThe historical population of Lucerne is given in the following table:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe city grew up around Sankt Leodegar Abbey, founded in AD 840, and remained strongly Roman Catholic into the 21st century. By 1850, 96.9% of the population was Catholic, in 1900 it was 81.9% and in 1950 it was still 72.3%. In the 2000 census the religious membership of Lucerne was: 35,682 (60%) Roman Catholic, 9,227 (15.5%) Protestant, with an additional 1,979 (3.33%) who were of some other Christian denominations; 1,824 individuals (3.07% of the population) Muslim; 196 individuals (0.33% of the population) Jewish.

Suva, one of Switzerland's oldest accident insurance companies, is also based in Lucerne, as is the University of Lucerne, the youngest of Switzerland's traditional universities.\nThanks to its continuous tax-cutting policies, Lucerne has become Switzerland's most business-friendly canton. As of 2012 Lucerne offers Switzerland's lowest corporate tax rate at cantonal level.Furthermore, Lucerne also offers very moderate personal income tax rates. In a recent published study of BAK Basel Economics taxation index 2012, Lucerne made it to the 4th place with an only marginally 2% higher tax rate compared to the top canton in this comparison.\n\n\n== Sights ==\nSince the city straddles the Reuss where it drains the lake, it has a number of bridges. The most famous is the Chapel Bridge (Kapellbr\u00fccke), a 204 m (669 ft) long wooden covered bridge originally built in 1333, the oldest covered bridge in Europe, although much of it had to be replaced after a fire on 18 August 1993, allegedly caused by a discarded cigarette. Partway across, the bridge runs by the octagonal Water Tower (Wasserturm), a fortification from the 13th century. Inside the bridge are a series of paintings from the 17th century depicting events from Lucerne's history. The Bridge with its Tower is the city's most famous landmark.\n\nDownriver, between the Kasernenplatz and the M\u00fchlenplatz, the Spreuer Bridge (Spreuerbr\u00fccke or M\u00fchlenbr\u00fccke, Mill Bridge) zigzags across the Reuss. Constructed in 1408, it features a series of medieval-style 17th century plague paintings by Kaspar Meglinger (de) titled Dance of Death (Totentanzzyklus). The bridge has a small chapel in the middle that was added in 1568.\nOld Town Lucerne is mainly located just north of the Reuss, and still has several fine half-timber structures with painted fronts. Remnants of the old town walls exist on the hill above Lucerne, complete with eight tall watch towers. An additional gated tower sits at the base of the hill on the banks of the Reuss.\nThe twin needle towers of the Church of St. Leodegar, which was named after the city's patron saint, sit on a small hill just above the lake front. Originally built in 735, the present structure was erected in 1633 in the late Renaissance style. However, the towers are surviving remnants of an earlier structure. The interior is richly decorated. The church is popularly called the Hofkirche (in German) and is known locally as the Hofchile (in Swiss-German).\nBertel Thorvaldsen's famous carving of a dying lion (the Lion Monument, or L\u00f6wendenkmal) is found in a small park just off the L\u00f6wenplatz. The carving commemorates the hundreds of Swiss Guards of who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when an armed mob stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris.\nThe Swiss Museum of Transport is a large and comprehensive museum exhibiting all forms of transport, including locomotives, automobiles, ships, and aircraft. It is to be found beside the lake in the northern-eastern section of the city.\nThe Culture and Convention Center (KKL) beside the lake in the center of the city was designed by Jean Nouvel. The center has one of the world's leading concert halls, with acoustics by Russell Johnson.\nThe Richard Wagner Museum is found on the lake at Tribschen and is dedicated to the composer Richard Wagner. Wagner lived in Lucerne from 1866 to 1872 and his former villa now hosts the museum dedicated to him.\n\n\n== Culture and events ==\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nSince plans for the new culture and convention centre arose in the late 1980s, Lucerne has found a balance between the so-called established culture and alternative culture. A consensus was reached that culminated in a culture compromise (Kulturkompromiss). The established culture comprises the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre (KKL), the city theater (Luzerner Theater) and, in a broader sense, smaller establishments such as the Kleintheater, founded by comedian Emil Steinberger, a Lucerne native, or Stadtkeller, a music restaurant in the city's old town. KKL houses a concert hall as well as the Museum of Art Lucerne (Kunstmuseum Luzern).\nAlternative culture took place mostly on the premises of a former tube factory, which became known as Boa. Other localities for alternative culture have since emerged in the same inner city area as Boa. Initially, Boa staged various plays, but concerts became more and more common; this new use of the building clashed with the development of apartment buildings on nearby lots of land. Due to possible noise pollution, Boa was closed and a replacement in a less heavily inhabited area is currently under construction. Critics claimed though that the new establishment would not meet the requirements for an alternative culture.\nS\u00fcdpol is a center for performing arts in Lucerne presenting music-, dance- and theatre-events. The house at the foot of Pilatus opened in November 2008.\nLucerne is home to the Luzerner Sinfonieorchester, a category A symphonic orchestra, and to the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra, and they both hold most of their performances in the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre.\nLucerne is also home to Keramikkonzerte, a series of classical chamber music concerts held throughout each year, as well as Zaubersee, a festival dedicated to Russian classical music.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nEvery year, towards the end of winter, Fasnacht (Carnival) breaks out in the streets, alleyways and squares of the old town. This is a glittering outdoor party, where chaos and merriness reign and nothing is as it normally is. Strange characters in fantastic masks and costumes make their way through the alleyways, while Guggenmusiken (carnival bands) blow their instruments in joyful cacophony and thousands of bizarrely clad people sing and dance away the winter. The Lucerner Fasnacht, based on religious, Catholic backgrounds, starts every year on the Thursday before Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday) with a big bang at 5am called Morgenwacht (Morning Watch). There are big parades in the afternoon on Schmotzige Donnerstag (literally: Lardy Thursday) and the following Monday, called G\u00fcdismontag (literally: Paunch Monday), which attract tens of thousands of people. Lucerne's Carnival ends with a crowning finish on G\u00fcdisdienstag (literally: Paunch Tuesday) evening with the Monstercorso, a tremendous parade of Guggenmusiken, lights and lanterns with even a larger audience. Rather recently a fourth Fasnacht day has been introduced on the Saturday between the others Fasnacht days, the R\u00fc\u00fcdige Samstag while mainly several indoor balls take place. From dusk till dawn on the evenings of Schmotzige Donnerstag, G\u00fcdismontag, and after the Monstercorso many bands wander through the historical part of the city playing typical Fasnacht tunes. Until midnight, the historical part of the city usually is packed with people participating. A large part of the audience are also dressed up in costumes, even a majority in the evenings.\n\nThe city hosts various renowned festivals throughout the year. The Lucerne Festival for classical music takes place in the summer. Its orchestra, the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, is hand-picked from some of the finest instrumentalists in the world. In June yearly the pop music festival B-Sides takes place in Lucerne. It focuses on international acts in alternative music, indie rock, experimental rock and other cutting edge and left field artistic musical genres. In July, the Blue Balls Festival brings jazz, blues and punk music to the lake promenade and halls of the Culture and Convention Center. The Lucerne Blues Festival is another musical festival which usually takes place in November. Since spring 2004, Lucerne has hosted the Festival Rose d'Or for television entertainment. And in April, the well-established comics festival Fumetto attracts an international audience.\nBeing the cultural center of a rather rural region, Lucerne regularly holds different folklore festivals, such as Lucerne Cheese Festival, held annually. In 2004, Lucerne was the focus of Swiss Wrestling fans when it had hosted the Swiss Wrestling and Alpine festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Schwing- und \u00c4lplerfest), which takes place every three years in a different location. A national music festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssiches Musikfest) attracted marching bands from all parts of Switzerland in 2006. In summer 2008, the yodelling festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Jodlerfest) had a similar impact.\nThe 2021 Winter Universiade will be hosted by Lucerne.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLucerne boasts a developed and well-run transport network, with the main operator, Verkehrsbetriebe Luzern (VBL), running both the trolleybuses in Lucerne and a motor buses network in the city and to neighboring municipalities. Other operators, such as PostAuto Schweiz and Auto AG Rothenburg, provide bus services to other towns and villages.\nLucerne railway station is one of Switzerland's principal stations, and is well-connected to the rest of Switzerland via railway services operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) and the Zentralbahn (zb). There are 40 trains per day between Lucerne and Zurich, with an average travel time of 48 minutes. Zurich Airport can be reached in just over an hour.Two other railway stations are located within the city boundaries, with Lucerne Allmend/Messe railway station close to the Swissporarena in the south of the city, and the Lucerne Verkehrshaus railway station adjacent to the Swiss Museum of Transport in the east.\nLucerne's city transit system is fully integrated into the coherent and integrated fare network system called passepartout encompassing all kind of public transport in the cantons of Lucerne, Obwalden, and Nidwalden.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThere are several football clubs throughout the city. The most successful one is FC Luzern which plays in Switzerland's premier league (Swiss Super League). The club plays its home matches at the new Swissporarena, with a capacity of 16,800.\nThe city's main hockey team is the HC Luzern which plays in the Swiss Second League, the fourth tier of Swiss hockey. They play their home games in the 5,000-seat Swiss Life Arena.\nIn the past, Lucerne also produced national successes in men's handball and women's volleyball and softball.\nHaving a long tradition of equestrian sports, Lucerne has co-hosted CSIO Switzerland, an international equestrian show jumping event, until it left entirely for St. Gallen in 2006. Since then, the Lucerne Equestrian Masters replaced it. There is also an annual horse racing event, usually taking place in August.\nLucerne annually hosts the final leg of the Rowing World Cup on Rotsee Lake. Numerous World Rowing Championships have been held in Lucerne including the inaugural World Championships of 1962 and then the regattas of 1974, 1982 and 2001\nLucerne hosts the annual Spitzen Leichtathletik Luzern Track and field meeting, which attracts world class athletes such as Yohan Blake and Valerie Adams.\nThe city also provides facilities for ice-hockey, figure-skating, golf, swimming, basketball, rugby, skateboarding, climbing and more.\nLucerne hosted FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour event Lucerne Open 2015 and FIVB Beach Volleyball U21 World Championship in 2016.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Lucerne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Lucerne\".

          "For 25 Swiss per person you would at least expect a cool building but during this heat wave it was overly warm-can\u2019t be good for the art which I felt was underwhelming and did not compare to other galleries such as Vienna etc.",
          "Modern Art Museum is one of the art museums located in the center of Luzern, a city in Switzerland. It is inside the KKL building, a very modern building, where there are a bar, the concert hall and sone other places. The museum was normal: it has some temporary exposition,",
          "We were only able to see the exterior. However, it in of itself is an interesting piece of art. Like the train station it is so modern in a city that has worked so hard to stay the same. However, as I have said on the station, the fact that the museum and station are",
          "This modern art museum next to Lucerne train station should be avoided. It is expensive and not worth the money. The facility itself is modern and that is the only positive thing. There was not a lot there. Only two exhibitions available for viewing and yet we were still",
          "The museum is a pretty space in the KKL Building. The museum displays art from ~1800 to the present. While we were visiting, there was an interesting display of art from around 1800, chosen because that year (and it\u2019s neighbors) was an intellectual turning point. The comments",
          "Best thing about this collection was the space it was hung in. Possibly the worst collection of publicly owned art that we've seen. Most was pretentious and or lazy. Unless its raining and you cant think of anything else to do, avoid at all costs.",
          "This museum is apparently part of the KKL, a big complex which includes a concert hall. I visited only the museum. Unfortunately, I caught them as they were changing between exhibits. I found the art very interesting. Modern and challenging and fun. I was very lucky to see a",

His plan was to make a permanent exhibition of the large scale landscape paintings of the Alps that he loved. With the help of his son Ernst Hodel junior, he realized a series depicting the Alps, which debuted in May 1901 under the name Alpineum. The paintings occupy a surface of more than five hundred square meters, offering beautiful and unique insight into the world of the Swiss Alps.\nDespite Ernst Hodel the younger passing in 1955, the Alpineum continued operation under his descendants and is still open today.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlpineum website",

He's already re-created two of history's worst disasters, and is only biding his time before he strikes again.\nThe clues that the Cahill kids have gathered suggest that the Outcast's latest disaster is modeled after Hurricane Katrina.

Meanwhile, Amy, Jonah, and Hamilton will head to Shanghai, China, to look into an exposition with many Ekats in attendance while Cara and Ian head to Ukraine to look into the Chernobyl disaster.\n\n\n== Superspecial ==\nSuperspecial is the fifth and final series in The 39 Clues franchise. The series consists of only one standalone novel.\n\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n\nOutbreak is the first and final book in the Superspecial series, and the final book in The 39 Clues franchise. It was written by C. Alexander London and published on September 27, 2016.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n== Supplementary works ==\nScholastic has expanded the 39 Clues universe with several books. In 2010 Scholastic published Agent Handbook, which explores the techniques that the clue hunters in the series use to find clues, and The Black Book of Buried Secrets, which provides more information about events in the series. In the last week of December 2011, the Scholastic editorial team released seven short stories as part of The 39 Clues: Rapid Fire e-book series. The editorial team has also released \"The Cahill Files\", which includes Operation Trinity, Spymasters, and four e-books. As part of the multimedia interactive experience to promote the series, Scholastic includes six cards in each book of the 39 Clues series. Each card leads to one online clue, which readers can unlock by entering the code on the cards on their 39 Clues account online.\n\n\n=== Cards ===\nThe 39 Clues uses collectible cards to expand readers' experience of the series. In the first series of books, The Clue Hunt, each book came with six game cards. These cards all shared the same code and once added online would unlock the clue in that book. Alongside the first series of books, Card Packs were sold. These card packs contained 16 random cards out of a total of roughly 50 that were not available in the books. The card packs were:\n\nIn the second series each book again came with six cards. However, unlike the first series, the cards were needed to unlock the online missions. Cahills vs Vespers also had two card packs. These card packs all contained the same 16 game cards, which would unlock the online extreme missions. The card packs were:\n\nIn the third series Unstoppable, each book contains six game cards. These cards unlock an extra game in their corresponding online missions.\nIn the fourth series Doublecross, each book will contain six virtual cards.\nOverall, the cards form a key part of the series. Players on the online website can only collect all the clues through the use of the cards, and in later series can only unlock the missions by having the cards. The cards in the first series often had puzzles and riddles to solve.\nAdditional cards have been released over the course of the series, and the cards are only virtual. Scholastic developed a game involving the cards, Doublecross, in which players physically use their cards to battle their opponents.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe 39 Clues series consists of adventure novels; however, the novels also fall within the genre of historical fiction. The stories switch back and forth between different characters' points of view. Each novel focuses on one historical figure and geographical location as Dan and Amy explore a clue related to a prominent Cahill family member in an exotic location.One theme of the series is the relationship between talent and success. Each branch of the Cahill family has specific talents in a certain area; for example, the Ekaterina branch specializes in inventions and technology, the Tomas branch in Athleticism and Strength, the Lucians in Strategy and Politics, and Janus in Art and Music. Amy and Dan's competitors' talents give them an advantage, yet Amy and Dan consistently are ahead in the hunt and are viewed as the main threats. Over the course of the books, Amy and Dan discover their own talents.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nAn editorial team in Scholastic came up with the idea of an interactive series with online games and asked Rick Riordan to write the first book. Riordan agreed because he thought it was a good idea, and as a middle school teacher he loved making history enjoyable for younger readers. The project was kept secret for about two years.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nAs of June 11, 2010, The 39 Clues series had been on the New York Times bestseller list of Children's Series books for 48 weeks. Books in the series have also appeared on the USA Today, Publishers Weekly, and Wall Street Journal bestseller lists.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nCritical reception of the 39 Clues has been mostly positive. The first book was met with positive reviews and spawned optimism for the rest of the series. The books have been very popular among kids.\n\n\n== Film ==\nSteven Spielberg acquired film rights to the series in June 2008. Spielberg and Scholastic Media president Deborah Forte will produce the series, while Brett Ratner expressed interest in directing the first film. Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson was hired to write the script in September 2008. In May 2012, Shawn Levy, the director of the Night at the Museum movies, acquired the rights to direct the movie. The movie rights were taken by Universal, in August 2013.  A film, The 39 Clues: The Movie, was originally planned to be released in 2014, but so far the movie has not yet entered production.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nInfinity Ring\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nScholastic Plans to Put Its Branding Iron on a Successor to Harry Potter",

It is Switzerland's most popular museum. The museum also maintains a large collection of work by Hans Erni, a local painter and sculptor.\nThere are several other attractions in the museum besides the collection, including a planetarium, a large-format cinema and a 1:20,000 scale aerial photograph of Switzerland.\n\n\n== Notable Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nRolling stock of the Spanisch Br\u00f6tli Bahn (literally \"Spanish bread roll railway\"), the first Swiss railway company\nThe SBB Ae 8/14 of the 1930s, the most powerful electrical engine of that time\nA H0 gauge model of the Gotthard railway line (section Erstfeld to G\u00f6schenen)\n\n\n=== Automobiles ===\nAn exhibition hall with cars from different eras. The external walls of the exhibit are with 344 used Swiss road signs.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\na Convair Coronado\nthe only existing Lockheed Orion single-engine airliner\ncountless other aircraft\n\n\n=== Space ===\nIt also houses EURECA, a 4.5 tonne satellite, which is among the few space objects returned safely to earth.\nA Spacelab pallet was handed over to the Museum for permanent display on 5 March 2010. The pallet, nicknamed Elvis, was used during the 8-day STS-46 mission, 31 July - 8 August 1992, when ESA astronaut Claude Nicollier was on board Shuttle Atlantis to deploy ESA's European Retrievable Carrier (Eureca) scientific mission and the joint NASA/Italian Space Agency Tethered Satellite System (TSS-1). The Pallet carried TSS-1 in the Shuttle's cargo bay.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe museum is located on the shore of Lake Lucerne in the northern section of the city of Lucerne, some 30 minutes walking time from the town centre. It is served by trains of the Lucerne S-Bahn at the adjacent Lucerne Verkehrshaus railway station, by boat services of the Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersees on the lake, and by the Lucerne trolleybus system. All three provide convenient connections with central Lucerne.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of aerospace museums\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial museum website\nOfficial website of painter Hans Erni\nOfficial Website of Lucerne",

          "Restaurants were decent and exhibits were excellent. Planetarium was a bit of a miss, but enjoyed the Swiss chocolate tour. Tip - decide on which exhibits you want to visit before payment, so you can enjoy packages. Also, not sure what a family ticket includes. Should ask.",
          "Wow where do I start? I purchased a ticket which included the Swiss chocolate adventure and the media world. You can purchase a ticket which includes the planetarium. The chocolate adventure was great. It showed the history of chocolate from the bean to the finished product.",

          "Bigger than you think. Trains, boats, planesand history new and old. You can spend hours. Interesting.",
          "The best things in the museum were the space and air travel sections. The downside was that all the train exhibits were closed off to the public to view inside.",
          "A truly fantastic experience. The Transport museum is really a must see for all ages. We had a great experience there with the family. The trains, cars, aircraft were fabulous. Also, the room of mirrors was awesome.",
          "Honestly, A transportation museum would have been the last thing on my list of things to do, but what a surprise! We did have a guide, which probably made it more interesting. However, we were just amazed at all the museum had to offer and how much history of Switzerland it",

          "If you're going to Lucerne this museum should be on your list. Getting there is fun too by either by bus, boat or walking. The setting is lovely and the exhibits are exceptional. There are separate buildings for each form of transport- autos, ships, air, trains. There's",
          "This museum is great if you are interested in transports : you have different sections with all kind of transports from trains to planes. You can easily spend half a day if not a full day if you visit it with children. There is also an IMAX theater in it with movies at",
          "Somehow this just does not measure up to other transport museums in Europe. The trains cannot be entered and the entire environment is sterile. You should expect a lot more for CHF 60 for two. The French, Dutch, British, Spanish, Germans and Swedes have far superior transport",
          "We (3 adults) only did this really by chance as the weather wasn't great and I didn't want to risk a mountain trip. Easy to get to by bus (or train) from Luzern, and the bus stop was a short walk away. The museum was open before the scheduled time to sell tickets, then we waited",
          "Perfect place for kids to see and experience various modes of transportation. Almost all areas have simulation which kids love to lay hands on (train, fighter plane, helicopter, landing commercial plane etc.). Numerous outdoor activities as well within the same price. A Swiss",

          "Of course if it's raining everyone in town will be there with their kids. I don't consider myself to be a curmudgeon, but kids running around under foot and making noise made this place unpleasant for me. Our guided tour spent a lot of time on trains and the Gotthard tunnel",
          "Amazing and interactive! If you enjoy museums that teach you and let you and your family fave fun at the same time this is the perfect museum for you. It had many activities for all ages. I suggest going earlier in the day to devote about 4-5 hours if you want to cover",

          "Not worth visiting if you have limited time in Lucern. Such museums can be visited at others places. while at Lucern there are far better places to see unless you are fond of transport machines",
          "Situated close to the Chapel Bridge and Lake Lucerne, this museum is worth a visit if your children are fans of steam locomotives. Our family wasn't that impressive with the interactive games, most of which is out of order. The highlight for us, instead, is the outdoor Road",
          "Extremely well maintained with live demonstrations, videos, sound effects and various games. Require atleast 4-5 hours or more to explore it fully. Helicopter ride simulation is awsome.",
          "Enjoyed the visit. Need at least three hours to do justice to your visit. The small steam engine train was the best. Don't miss your ride on it. It's not just for kids & their parents. It's for all! The collection of trains & cars was amazing. The way the car you choose to see",
          "Travelling with our 7 yr old son we spent a very enjoyable day at the museum 11am-6pm. Like all things in Switzerland, it is pricey at 96CHF for our family ticket which included a tour \"the Swiss chocolate adventure\" (well worth it). The museum is very interactive with more",

          "Always a lovely day out with the kids. You do not see all in one day, so either plan a trip for a few days, or be aware that you will be back for more. You get to see details about trains, cars, planes, cable cars, tunnels etc etc. You can experience and do thighs yourself. They",

          "I stayed in Hergiswil so I suggest that the good way is to take boat/ship to go to the museum because the museum is opposite to the pier, just a few mins to go to the museum. Next to the pier, there is a beach. People have to pay for using beaches and facilities in Switzerland.",

          "A walk along the lakeside brought us to the museum by accident. We had a meal in the self service restaurant, which was tasty, healthy and economic. They have a price per weight system, which I've never encountered before. You take what you want, they weigh it and charge pro",

          "This is a great museum. I have no interest in the subject matter (too bad for me), but the museum is extremely well done. Children will almost certainly love it; there are many extremely kid-friendly exhibits and activities. Adults will find many unique and innovative",

          "The museum needs a full day to explore and enjoy everything it presents. The exhibits, film and chocolate factory tour were a hit in my family. I would definitely recommend a visit when you are in Luzern.",

          "Fantastic exhibits covering all types of Swiss transport. Only criticism is some of the stands have information in English and others randomly don't, nothing worth worrying about though as the place has lots to feast the eyes on.",
          "well done for KIDS , EXPENSIVE though , chocklate factory is good. play area is nice. restaurant is good . you need to spend around 5 hours in this place. good to visit when you cannot do mountains",
          "Fun for kids and adults, the kids loved playing outside but also to learn about trains and other staff. There are many things to do for more then one day",
          "A fascinating Museum with a lot to see. It was interesting for us parents, but it seemed that the children got even more out of the trip. There are many hands on exhibits and activities. The entrance fee was a bit higher than we expected, but it was definitely worth it!",
          "Not a bad museum to visit. Pricey admission but worth it. Tons of really neat stuff to see, with many activities for the kids.",
          "An amazing review of transport and Swiss innovation, particularly the trains. You almost need to make several visits to get it all in.",
          "Soooo many trains... I liked the small part dedicated to scuba diving, the airplanes, and the dam demonstration. The outside area was great for kids. The whole set up seemed more geared toward children, but glad we went.",

          "To go there take bus 6 or 8 from luzern rail station. If you have swiss pass, you will get 50% discount from the regular price for adult 30 CHF. This museum talked about the history of swiss transportation and it is funny for children, there are train, airplane , ... stimulater.",
          "The first thing I noticed here was all the children running around! There's a great play area outside for little kids with a trampoline, a mini lake where they can \"drive\" little boats, fake construction areas, etc. I 100% recommend this place if you have small children- they'd",
          "Spent Good Friday at the museum. The rail section is great, shame it is not bigger. Some super cut aways to see. The aviation side was a bit disappointing. Lots of aircraft hanging from the ceiling but not a huge amount of info on them. But the sad thing was they were covered in",

          "Very attractive museum as is adapts the exhibitions very often to actual events e.g. actually to the opening of the NEAT tunnel. For kids a great fun is an \"excursion\" in small boxes from African cacao plantations to the final chocolate specialities. You may also yourself act",

          "One of the best spots on our 2 week long caravan journey! Kids and adults as well can try many things on their own, the outside playground is just gorgeous. Planetarium wasn\u00b4t that fascinating for us but that might be because of the fact that we did not choose the most",

It connects a rock path with the lookout point Hammetschwand on the B\u00fcrgenstock plateau overlooking Lake Lucerne.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt by hotel and railway businessman Franz Josef Bucher it was the first of its type in Switzerland when first opened in 1905. The lift carries passengers 153 metres up to the summit of the Hammetschwand in under a minute, and holds the record for the highest exterior lift in Europe. The current lift was built and opened by the Schindler Group.\nThe original lift operated at a speed of one metre per second and took nearly three minutes to reach the summit of the Hammetschwand, carrying up to 8 people in its wooden/zinc plated cab. In 1935 the lift's speed was increased to 2.7 metres per second and the cab was replaced with a lighter metal construction. At this time it was not only the highest public external elevator in Europe, but also the fastest elevator in the world. The filigrain, metal lattice tower has a surface area of 2\u00d72 metres, is 118 metres high and is located on a 44-metre-high (144 ft) rock pit. The elevator entrance, the engine room and the first 14 metres of this pit are within the mountain, while the next 30 meters of the shaft extend into the open air, offering a view of Lake Lucerne. At the top station of Hammetschwand (1132 metres above sea level), there are panoramic views of the lake and the Alps.\n\n\n== External links ==\nHammetschwand Elevator at Structurae\nhttp://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=47238",

        "wiki": "Lucerne ( loo-SURN, French: [lys\u025b\u0281n]; German: Luzern [lu\u02c8ts\u025brn] (listen); Lucerne German: Loz\u00e4rn; Italian: Lucerna [lu\u02c8t\u0283\u025brna]; Romansh: Lucerna [lu\u02c8ts\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name. With a population of approximately 82,000 people, Lucerne is the most populous town in Central Switzerland, and a nexus of economics, transportation, culture, and media in the region. The city's urban area consists of 19 municipalities and towns with an overall population of about 220,000 people.Owing to its location on the shores of Lake Lucerne (German: Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee) and its outflow, the river Reuss, within sight of the mounts Pilatus and Rigi in the Swiss Alps, Lucerne has long been a destination for tourists. One of the city's famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge (German: Kapellbr\u00fccke), a wooden bridge first erected in the 14th century.\nThe official language of Lucerne is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and founding (750\u20131386) ===\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire beginning in the 6th century, Germanic Alemannic peoples increased their influence on this area of present-day Switzerland.\nAround 750 the Benedictine Monastery of St. Leodegar was founded, which was later acquired by Murbach Abbey in Alsace in the middle of the 9th century, and by this time the area had become known as Luciaria.The origin of the name is uncertain, it is possibly derived from the Latin name of the pike, lucius, thus designating a pike fishing spot in the river Reuss. Derivation from the theonym Lugus has been suggested but is phonetically implausible. In any case, the name was associated by popular etymology with Latin lucerna \"lantern\" from an early time.In 1178 Lucerne acquired its independence from the jurisdiction of Murbach Abbey, and the founding of the city proper probably occurred that same year. The city gained importance as a strategically located gateway for the growing commerce from the Gotthard trade route.\nBy 1290, Lucerne had become a self-sufficient city of reasonable size with about 3000 inhabitants. About this time King Rudolph I von Habsburg gained authority over the Monastery of St. Leodegar and its lands, including Lucerne. The populace was not content with the increasing Habsburg influence, and Lucerne allied with neighboring towns to seek independence from their rule. Along with Lucerne, the three other forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed the \"eternal\" Swiss Confederacy, known as the Eidgenossenschaft, on November 7, 1332.\nLater the cities of Z\u00fcrich, Zug and Bern joined the alliance. With the help of these additions, the rule of Austria over the area came to an end. The issue was settled by Lucerne's victory over the Habsburgs in the Battle of Sempach in 1386. For Lucerne this victory ignited an era of expansion. The city shortly granted many rights to itself, rights which had been withheld by the Habsburgs until then. By this time the borders of Lucerne were approximately those of today.\n\n\n=== From city to city-state (1386\u20131520) ===\nIn 1415 Lucerne gained Reichsfreiheit from Emperor Sigismund and became a strong member of the Swiss confederacy. The city developed its infrastructure, raised taxes, and appointed its own local officials. The city's population of 3000 dropped about 40% due to the Black Plague and several wars around 1350.\nIn 1419 town records show the first witch trial against a male person.\n\n\n=== Swiss-Catholic town (1520\u20131798) ===\n\nAmong the growing towns of the confederacy, Lucerne was especially popular in attracting new residents. Remaining predominantly Catholic, Lucerne hosted its own annual passion play from 1453 to 1616, a two-day-long play of 12 hours performance per day. As the confederacy broke up during the Reformation, after 1520, most nearby cities became Protestant, but Lucerne remained Catholic. After the victory of the Catholics over the Protestants in the Battle at Kappel in 1531, the Catholic towns dominated the confederacy. It was during this period that Jesuits first came to Lucerne in 1567, with their arrival given considerable backing by Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. The region, though, was destined to be dominated by Protestant cities such as Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Basel, which defeated the Catholic forces in the 1712 Toggenburg War. The former prominent position of Lucerne in the confederacy was lost forever. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wars and epidemics became steadily less frequent and as a result the population of the country increased strongly.\nLucerne was besieged by a peasant army and quickly signed a peace treaty with the rebels in the Swiss peasant war of 1653.\n\n\n=== Century of revolutions (1798\u20131914) ===\n\nIn 1798, nine years after the beginning of the French Revolution, the French army marched into Switzerland. The old confederacy collapsed and the government became democratic. The industrial revolution hit Lucerne rather late, and by 1860 only 1.7% of the population worked in industry, which was about a quarter of the national average at that time. Agriculture, which employed about 40% of the workers, was the main form of economic output in the canton. Nevertheless, industry was attracted to the city from areas around Lucerne. From 1850 to 1913, the population quadrupled and the flow of settlers increased. In 1856 trains first linked the city to Olten and Basel, then Zug and Z\u00fcrich in 1864 and finally to the south in 1897.\nThe 1804 play William Tell by Friedrich Schiller did much to establish the reputation of Lucerne and its environs. Schiller himself had not been to Lucerne, but was inspired to write the play by his wife Lotte and his friend Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had both personally visited the city and its surrounding canton. Goethe had lodged in the Hirschenplatz on his route to Italy in 1779.It was during the latter part of the 19th century that Lucerne became a popular destination for artists, royalty and others to escape to. The German composer Richard Wagner established a residence at Tribschen in 1866 from which he lived and worked. The city was then boosted by a visit by Queen Victoria to the city in 1868, during which she went sightseeing at the Kapellbr\u00fccke and Lion Monument and relished speaking with local people in her native German. The American writer Mark Twain further popularised the city and its environs in his travel writings after visiting twice, in 1878 and 1897. In 1892 Swiss poet and future Nobel Prize laureate Carl Spitteler also established himself in Lucerne, living there until his death in 1924.Lucerne's status as a fashionable destination led to it becoming one of the first centres of modern-style tourism. Some of the city's most recognisable buildings are hotels from this period, such as the Schweizerhof Hotel (1845), Grand Hotel National (1870), and Ch\u00e2teau G\u00fctsch (1879). It was at the National that Swiss hotelier C\u00e9sar Ritz would establish himself as manager between 1878 and 1888.\n\n\n=== 20th and 21st century ===\n\nIn August 1993, the Kapellbr\u00fccke in the centre of the city suffered from a great fire which destroyed two thirds of its interior paintings. The bridge was subsequently reconstructed and reopened to the public in April 1994, after a total of CHF 3.4 million was spent on its repair.On June 17, 2007, voters of the city of Lucerne and the adjacent town of Littau agreed to a merger in a simultaneous referendum. This took effect on January 1, 2010. The new city, still called Lucerne, has a population of around 80,000 people, making it the seventh-largest city in Switzerland. The results of this referendum are expected to pave the way for negotiations with other nearby cities and towns in an effort to create a unified city-region, based on the results of a study.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLucerne is located at the outfall of Lake Lucerne into the river Reuss, which flows from south-east to north-west. The city occupies both banks of the river and the lowest reach of the lake, with the city centre straddling the river immediately downstream of the outfall. The city's suburbs climb the hills to the north-east and south-west, and stretch out along the river and lake banks, whilst the recently added area of Littau is to the north-west.Besides this contiguous city area, the municipality also includes an exclave on the south shore of Lake Lucerne some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) away, comprising the northern slopes of the B\u00fcrgenstock. This section of the municipality is entirely surrounded by the lake and by land of the canton of Nidwalden. It does not contain any significant settlements, but the summit of the B\u00fcrgenstock is the highest point of the municipality.The municipality has an area of 29.1 square kilometers (11.2 sq mi). Of this area and as of 2009, 28.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 47.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (2.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBetween 1961 and 1990 Lucerne had an average of 138.1 days of rain per year and on average received 1,171 mm (46.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month was June during which time Lucerne received an average of 153 mm (6.0 in) of rainfall. During this month there was rainfall for an average of 14.2 days. The driest month of the year was February with an average of 61 mm (2.4 in) of precipitation over 10.2 days. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the city of Lucerne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (German: Stadtrat/-r\u00e4tin), each presiding over a directorate (Direktion) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (Stadtpr\u00e4sident). In the mandate period (Legislatur) September 2016 \u2013 August 2020 the City Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Beat Z\u00fcsli. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Grand City Council are carried by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Lucerne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate.As of September 2016, Luzern's City Council is made up of one representative of the SP (Social Democratic Party, who is also the mayor), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GPS (Green Party), FDP (FDP.The Liberals), and glp (Green Liberal Party). The last regular election was held on 1 May/5 June 2016.\n\nToni G\u00f6pfert (FDP) is Town Chronicler (Stadtschreiber) since 1990.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Grand City Council (Grosser Stadtrat) holds legislative power. It is made up of 48 members, with elections held every four years. The Grand City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the Grand City Council are public. Unlike members of the City Council, members of the Grand City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Luzern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Grand City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Rathaus (Town Hall) am Kornmarkt.The last regular election of the Grand City Council was held on 1 May 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur) from September 2016 to August 2020. Currently the Grand City Council consist of 13 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS) and one of its junior section, the JUSO, 9 The Liberals (FDP/PLR), 7 Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 7 Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), 6 Green Party (GPS/PES) and one of its junior section, the jg of Luzern, and 4 Green Liberal Party (GLP/PVL).\n\n\n=== National elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 25.0% (-0.7) of the vote.

There were only 74 single story buildings and 1,721 four or more story buildings.\n\n\n=== Historic population ===\nThe historical population of Lucerne is given in the following table:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe city grew up around Sankt Leodegar Abbey, founded in AD 840, and remained strongly Roman Catholic into the 21st century. By 1850, 96.9% of the population was Catholic, in 1900 it was 81.9% and in 1950 it was still 72.3%. In the 2000 census the religious membership of Lucerne was: 35,682 (60%) Roman Catholic, 9,227 (15.5%) Protestant, with an additional 1,979 (3.33%) who were of some other Christian denominations; 1,824 individuals (3.07% of the population) Muslim; 196 individuals (0.33% of the population) Jewish.

Suva, one of Switzerland's oldest accident insurance companies, is also based in Lucerne, as is the University of Lucerne, the youngest of Switzerland's traditional universities.\nThanks to its continuous tax-cutting policies, Lucerne has become Switzerland's most business-friendly canton. As of 2012 Lucerne offers Switzerland's lowest corporate tax rate at cantonal level.Furthermore, Lucerne also offers very moderate personal income tax rates. In a recent published study of BAK Basel Economics taxation index 2012, Lucerne made it to the 4th place with an only marginally 2% higher tax rate compared to the top canton in this comparison.\n\n\n== Sights ==\nSince the city straddles the Reuss where it drains the lake, it has a number of bridges. The most famous is the Chapel Bridge (Kapellbr\u00fccke), a 204 m (669 ft) long wooden covered bridge originally built in 1333, the oldest covered bridge in Europe, although much of it had to be replaced after a fire on 18 August 1993, allegedly caused by a discarded cigarette. Partway across, the bridge runs by the octagonal Water Tower (Wasserturm), a fortification from the 13th century. Inside the bridge are a series of paintings from the 17th century depicting events from Lucerne's history. The Bridge with its Tower is the city's most famous landmark.\n\nDownriver, between the Kasernenplatz and the M\u00fchlenplatz, the Spreuer Bridge (Spreuerbr\u00fccke or M\u00fchlenbr\u00fccke, Mill Bridge) zigzags across the Reuss. Constructed in 1408, it features a series of medieval-style 17th century plague paintings by Kaspar Meglinger (de) titled Dance of Death (Totentanzzyklus). The bridge has a small chapel in the middle that was added in 1568.\nOld Town Lucerne is mainly located just north of the Reuss, and still has several fine half-timber structures with painted fronts. Remnants of the old town walls exist on the hill above Lucerne, complete with eight tall watch towers. An additional gated tower sits at the base of the hill on the banks of the Reuss.\nThe twin needle towers of the Church of St. Leodegar, which was named after the city's patron saint, sit on a small hill just above the lake front. Originally built in 735, the present structure was erected in 1633 in the late Renaissance style. However, the towers are surviving remnants of an earlier structure. The interior is richly decorated. The church is popularly called the Hofkirche (in German) and is known locally as the Hofchile (in Swiss-German).\nBertel Thorvaldsen's famous carving of a dying lion (the Lion Monument, or L\u00f6wendenkmal) is found in a small park just off the L\u00f6wenplatz. The carving commemorates the hundreds of Swiss Guards of who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when an armed mob stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris.\nThe Swiss Museum of Transport is a large and comprehensive museum exhibiting all forms of transport, including locomotives, automobiles, ships, and aircraft. It is to be found beside the lake in the northern-eastern section of the city.\nThe Culture and Convention Center (KKL) beside the lake in the center of the city was designed by Jean Nouvel. The center has one of the world's leading concert halls, with acoustics by Russell Johnson.\nThe Richard Wagner Museum is found on the lake at Tribschen and is dedicated to the composer Richard Wagner. Wagner lived in Lucerne from 1866 to 1872 and his former villa now hosts the museum dedicated to him.\n\n\n== Culture and events ==\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nSince plans for the new culture and convention centre arose in the late 1980s, Lucerne has found a balance between the so-called established culture and alternative culture. A consensus was reached that culminated in a culture compromise (Kulturkompromiss). The established culture comprises the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre (KKL), the city theater (Luzerner Theater) and, in a broader sense, smaller establishments such as the Kleintheater, founded by comedian Emil Steinberger, a Lucerne native, or Stadtkeller, a music restaurant in the city's old town. KKL houses a concert hall as well as the Museum of Art Lucerne (Kunstmuseum Luzern).\nAlternative culture took place mostly on the premises of a former tube factory, which became known as Boa. Other localities for alternative culture have since emerged in the same inner city area as Boa. Initially, Boa staged various plays, but concerts became more and more common; this new use of the building clashed with the development of apartment buildings on nearby lots of land. Due to possible noise pollution, Boa was closed and a replacement in a less heavily inhabited area is currently under construction. Critics claimed though that the new establishment would not meet the requirements for an alternative culture.\nS\u00fcdpol is a center for performing arts in Lucerne presenting music-, dance- and theatre-events. The house at the foot of Pilatus opened in November 2008.\nLucerne is home to the Luzerner Sinfonieorchester, a category A symphonic orchestra, and to the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra, and they both hold most of their performances in the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre.\nLucerne is also home to Keramikkonzerte, a series of classical chamber music concerts held throughout each year, as well as Zaubersee, a festival dedicated to Russian classical music.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nEvery year, towards the end of winter, Fasnacht (Carnival) breaks out in the streets, alleyways and squares of the old town. This is a glittering outdoor party, where chaos and merriness reign and nothing is as it normally is. Strange characters in fantastic masks and costumes make their way through the alleyways, while Guggenmusiken (carnival bands) blow their instruments in joyful cacophony and thousands of bizarrely clad people sing and dance away the winter. The Lucerner Fasnacht, based on religious, Catholic backgrounds, starts every year on the Thursday before Aschermittwoch (Ash Wednesday) with a big bang at 5am called Morgenwacht (Morning Watch). There are big parades in the afternoon on Schmotzige Donnerstag (literally: Lardy Thursday) and the following Monday, called G\u00fcdismontag (literally: Paunch Monday), which attract tens of thousands of people. Lucerne's Carnival ends with a crowning finish on G\u00fcdisdienstag (literally: Paunch Tuesday) evening with the Monstercorso, a tremendous parade of Guggenmusiken, lights and lanterns with even a larger audience. Rather recently a fourth Fasnacht day has been introduced on the Saturday between the others Fasnacht days, the R\u00fc\u00fcdige Samstag while mainly several indoor balls take place. From dusk till dawn on the evenings of Schmotzige Donnerstag, G\u00fcdismontag, and after the Monstercorso many bands wander through the historical part of the city playing typical Fasnacht tunes. Until midnight, the historical part of the city usually is packed with people participating. A large part of the audience are also dressed up in costumes, even a majority in the evenings.\n\nThe city hosts various renowned festivals throughout the year. The Lucerne Festival for classical music takes place in the summer. Its orchestra, the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, is hand-picked from some of the finest instrumentalists in the world. In June yearly the pop music festival B-Sides takes place in Lucerne. It focuses on international acts in alternative music, indie rock, experimental rock and other cutting edge and left field artistic musical genres. In July, the Blue Balls Festival brings jazz, blues and punk music to the lake promenade and halls of the Culture and Convention Center. The Lucerne Blues Festival is another musical festival which usually takes place in November. Since spring 2004, Lucerne has hosted the Festival Rose d'Or for television entertainment. And in April, the well-established comics festival Fumetto attracts an international audience.\nBeing the cultural center of a rather rural region, Lucerne regularly holds different folklore festivals, such as Lucerne Cheese Festival, held annually. In 2004, Lucerne was the focus of Swiss Wrestling fans when it had hosted the Swiss Wrestling and Alpine festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Schwing- und \u00c4lplerfest), which takes place every three years in a different location. A national music festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssiches Musikfest) attracted marching bands from all parts of Switzerland in 2006. In summer 2008, the yodelling festival (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Jodlerfest) had a similar impact.\nThe 2021 Winter Universiade will be hosted by Lucerne.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLucerne boasts a developed and well-run transport network, with the main operator, Verkehrsbetriebe Luzern (VBL), running both the trolleybuses in Lucerne and a motor buses network in the city and to neighboring municipalities. Other operators, such as PostAuto Schweiz and Auto AG Rothenburg, provide bus services to other towns and villages.\nLucerne railway station is one of Switzerland's principal stations, and is well-connected to the rest of Switzerland via railway services operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) and the Zentralbahn (zb). There are 40 trains per day between Lucerne and Zurich, with an average travel time of 48 minutes. Zurich Airport can be reached in just over an hour.Two other railway stations are located within the city boundaries, with Lucerne Allmend/Messe railway station close to the Swissporarena in the south of the city, and the Lucerne Verkehrshaus railway station adjacent to the Swiss Museum of Transport in the east.\nLucerne's city transit system is fully integrated into the coherent and integrated fare network system called passepartout encompassing all kind of public transport in the cantons of Lucerne, Obwalden, and Nidwalden.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThere are several football clubs throughout the city. The most successful one is FC Luzern which plays in Switzerland's premier league (Swiss Super League). The club plays its home matches at the new Swissporarena, with a capacity of 16,800.\nThe city's main hockey team is the HC Luzern which plays in the Swiss Second League, the fourth tier of Swiss hockey. They play their home games in the 5,000-seat Swiss Life Arena.\nIn the past, Lucerne also produced national successes in men's handball and women's volleyball and softball.\nHaving a long tradition of equestrian sports, Lucerne has co-hosted CSIO Switzerland, an international equestrian show jumping event, until it left entirely for St. Gallen in 2006. Since then, the Lucerne Equestrian Masters replaced it. There is also an annual horse racing event, usually taking place in August.\nLucerne annually hosts the final leg of the Rowing World Cup on Rotsee Lake. Numerous World Rowing Championships have been held in Lucerne including the inaugural World Championships of 1962 and then the regattas of 1974, 1982 and 2001\nLucerne hosts the annual Spitzen Leichtathletik Luzern Track and field meeting, which attracts world class athletes such as Yohan Blake and Valerie Adams.\nThe city also provides facilities for ice-hockey, figure-skating, golf, swimming, basketball, rugby, skateboarding, climbing and more.\nLucerne hosted FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour event Lucerne Open 2015 and FIVB Beach Volleyball U21 World Championship in 2016.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Lucerne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Lucerne\".

          "Tired of walking around and want to get off your feet yet still see Lucerne? This is the tour for you! We walked up to the train driver selling tickets outside of the train but he only accepted francs or euros for payment. So, we had to go inside the Hotel Schweizerhof to",
          "The town and nature are beautiful but trip is a waist of money and time and not very comfortable. In fact I was happy to get out..",
          "These trains are remarkably comfortable and easy to use! My husband and I purchased the rail pass with first class but, a lot of the smaller trains going into the towns don\u2019t have it. We still found them roomy and comfortable! It was really nice to relax and ride vs drive",
          "We decided to take a tour of Lucerne on the little City Train to see the old city and the bridges in comfort. It was nice change to walking the cobblestones. The commentary was clear and interesting and this would be great way for young and old to enjoy the city. It takes about",

          "My husband and I only had a few hours to explore Luzern, and the weather wasn\u2019t great, so this was the perfect way to get it all in! During high season it leaves on the hour every hour for most of the day and lasts about 50 minutes. An audio guide, which is available in several",
          "On a wet afternoon we enjoyed the hour long little train tour. The recorded commentary was clear and easy to understand. A great inexpensive introduction to Luzern. Pick up your tickets directly from the driver.",
          "This was not planned, but certainly worthwhile. After walking around, it was so nice to sit and enjoy a flute performance by the driver and an audio commentary throughout the tour. It gave a concise and inexpensive tour of the city.",
          "We jumped on this train on a whim. It was well worth the time as it showed us parts of Lucerne that we were not aware of. For 12 Chf and 40 minutes it was value for money.",
          "We took this little train, before we left on the tour the driver played us a tune on a small flute like instrument. The tour takes about 40 minutes and cost is 10Chf leaves from outside Hotel Schweizerhof which is across from the river in the centre of Lucerne. We thought we",
          "For those who enjoy the experience of a traditional, city tour... this is your tour! I loved the train ride through the old town and getting a general feel of Lucerne. You see the important sights. It is not a Hop on/Hop off train, but a 40 minute tour on a small, open train -",
          "This tram style train starts and ends at the Sterne Hotel Schweizehof in town. This 40 minute ride will give you a good sense of getting around Luzern. Expensive but well worth the journey. Head phones are supplied.",
          "It is a recorded message in your language train loop of Lucerne. It was a quick overview. I think you could see just as much on foot with a good map. You can't get off of the train so we walked back to see the Lion statue area after we finished.",
          "The tour of 40 minutes is good if one has limited time in the city. We are not allowed to get down once we are on board. The biggest disappointment was that we don't get a full view of lion monument which is one of the most important places in luzern. We could just see the head",
          "The driver was very Nice, the commentary in English was excellent and I think the price for the tour was very reasonable for the 40 minutes tour and all the information. I strongly recommend this tour!",
          "Save your francs and just go get a map from the tourist info center at the train station. This little trolley leaves every hour from in front of Schweizerhof hotel. You pay 12 francs, get a head set that you plug into a recorded message, just pick your language. If you are",
          "Best to do this before you start your individual explorations. It winds around a number of the streets giving you an orientation toward the landmarks that you can then return to see in greater detail. While not long 40-45 min. it introduces the city especially with the",
          "After a wee flute melody by the driver we were off for a quick trip around the place with the city tour beginning in front of the Schweizererhof hotel. I enjoyed being able to sit back and get my bearings while riding around the canton for a while on this good little tour around",

        "wiki": "The Lion Monument (German: L\u00f6wendenkmal), or the Lion of Lucerne, is a rock relief in Lucerne, Switzerland, designed by Bertel Thorvaldsen and hewn in 1820\u201321 by Lukas Ahorn. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris. It is one of the most famous monuments in Switzerland, visited annually by about 1.4 million tourists. In 2006 it was placed under Swiss monument protection.Mark Twain praised the sculpture of a mortally wounded lion as \"the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFrom the early 17th century, a regiment of Swiss Guards had served as part of the Royal Household of France. On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI had been forced to move with his family from the Palace of Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris. In June 1791 he tried to flee to Montm\u00e9dy near the frontier, where troops under royalist officers were concentrated. In the 1792 10th of August Insurrection, revolutionaries stormed the palace. Fighting broke out spontaneously after the Royal Family had been escorted from the Tuileries to take refuge with the Legislative Assembly. The Swiss Guards ran low on ammunition and were overwhelmed by superior numbers. A note written by the King half an hour after firing had commenced has survived, ordering the Swiss to retire and return to their barracks. Delivered in the middle of the fighting, this was only acted on after their position had become untenable.Of the Swiss Guards defending the Tuileries, more than six hundred were killed during the fighting or massacred after surrender. An estimated two hundred more died in prison of their wounds or were killed during the September Massacres that followed. Apart from about a hundred Swiss who escaped from the Tuileries, the only survivors of the regiment were a 300 strong detachment which, with the King's authorization, had been sent to Normandy to escort grain convoys a few days before August 10. The Swiss officers were mostly amongst those massacred, although Major Karl Josef von Bachmann \u2014 in command at the Tuileries \u2014 was formally tried and guillotined in September, still wearing his red uniform coat. Two surviving Swiss officers achieved senior rank under Napoleon.\n\n\n== Memorial ==\nThe initiative to create the monument was taken by Karl Pfyffer von Altishofen, an officer of the Guards who had been on leave in Lucerne at that time of the fight. He began collecting money in 1818. The monument was designed by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, and hewn in 1820\u201321 by  Lukas Ahorn, in a former sandstone quarry near Lucerne. Carved into the cliff face, the monument measures ten metres in length and six metres in height.\nThe monument is dedicated Helvetiorum Fidei ac Virtuti (\"To the loyalty and bravery of the Swiss\"). The dying lion is portrayed impaled by a spear, covering a shield bearing the fleur-de-lis of the French monarchy; beside him is another shield bearing the coat of arms of Switzerland. The inscription below the sculpture lists the names of the officers and gives the approximate numbers of soldiers who died (DCCLX = 760), and survived (CCCL = 350).The monument is described by Thomas Carlyle in The French Revolution: A History. The pose of the lion was copied in 1894 by Thomas M. Brady (1849\u20131907) for his Lion of Atlanta in the Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n== Mark Twain on the monument ==\n\nThe Lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low cliff\u2014for he is carved from the living rock of the cliff. His size is colossal, his attitude is noble. His head is bowed, the broken spear is sticking in his shoulder, his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of France. Vines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind, and a clear stream trickles from above and empties into a pond at the base, and in the smooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored, among the water-lilies.\n\nAround about are green trees and grass. The place is a sheltered, reposeful woodland nook, remote from noise and stir and confusion\u2014and all this is fitting, for lions do die in such places, and not on granite pedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings. The Lion of Lucerne would be impressive anywhere, but nowhere so impressive as where he is.\n\n\n== References in literature ==\n\nIn The Chalet School Does It Again (1955) Elinor Brent-Dyer describes the monument, its history and the associated chapel.\nIn The Lions of Lucerne (2002) author Brad Thor describes the monument and the Swiss Guard it commemorates.\nIn her New Yorker tribute \"My Buddy\" (2017), Patti Smith reflects upon the death of Sam Shepard while standing in front of and addressing the monument.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLion Monument, Lucerne, All About Switzerland travelguide.

          "Fabulous workmanship, this monument says a million things. The history behind this Sculpture goes deep and is the pride of Luzern\u2019s sight seeing spots. Take time to visit the Lion monument, read about its history, sit and absorb it all. If ever you get a chance to spend more",
          "A beautiful monument with an impressive sandstone sculpture carved as a memorial to King Louis XVI 's Swiss Guard, the majority of whom died trying to protect him from the revolutionaries.",
          "You can obviously see what the monument looks like from all the posted pictures, but to actually know the background and really see it is something. We went in the evening in the light rain so it was dark and quiet, very fittingly peaceful.",
          "Everyone should first do the research on this monument and than visit it...It is as moving as a stone art can be. Perfect",
          "I visited the Lion Monument in December 2019. It is a bit of a walk (15-20 minutes) from the Chapel Bridge but worth it. There was a lot of construction in the area and the only way to see the Lion Monument was to go on a viewing platform. I took some photos, admired it and",
          "Doesnt take too much time. Read the history before you go. Once you have visited, you dont need to see again.",
          "It wasn't as large as I had imagined but it was still worth the walk across town. Very special and good viewing vantages.",
          "The dying lion monument is beautiful and a place to pause and reflect. It is a small area with a pond and gardens and only a short walk from the train station. Unfortunately, tourists and selfie sticks really ruin the mood. I wish people would respect the areas and stop turning",
          "The story behind the monument is emotional, which in turn makes a visit to see it a necessary part of going to Lucerne. To hear the history, to reflect on it as it is in turn reflected in the waters beneath it, creates a sense of awe at the artist who surely wept while carving",
          "This is a quite superbly carved lion and it is quit moving. Apparently this piece of sculpture commemorates the Swiss Guards who defended the Pope.",
          "The lion statue in itself is an beautiful work of art, and therefore a must for any site seer to Luzern. Carved from the rock of an impressive hill side, with a small pool in the foreground. What makes it even more important is the story why it was carved. Do your homework",
          "This is a beautiful carving in the rock depicting a very sad tail. The carving is so good that the lion itself looks very sad. A must see attraction.",
          "Sculpted to commemorate the Swiss Guards who defended the Pope. I\u2019m not religious, but is an excellent depiction of a mortally wounded lion, carved into solid rock in heavy relief. We were there on a dull rainy day and slightly higher than the usual viewpoint, standing on",
          "The Lion of Lucerne is another \u201cmust see\u201d. There isn\u2019t much to do except look at it, but it is a magnificent carving with a great story. Make sure to look carefully to see the pig carved into the rock surrounding the sculpture and ask about that story, too!",

It\u2019s a wall carving of a large lion with a small shallow pond surrounding it. The lion symbolises the sacrifices made by the Swiss army in their line of duty. Good",

          "I have been to Lucerne 3 times and have taken people to this monument each time. It is a short walk from our hotel and the chapel bridge. This time the pond was dirty and the area around the monument looked like it needed some care. Some type of construction was going on so",
          "Ha ha... i had been to Luzern many times but never seen the lion..he\u2019s beautiful and worth making the effort, is a bit of a tourist attraction so could be busy,",
          "At a first glance this is merely a carving of a lion on a large stone wall. The lion is injured with a knife stuck in it\u2019s heart but it won\u2019t give up. This is symbolic of the bravery and loyalty of Swiss army who are reputed worldwide particularly for their loyalty. Good thought",
          "Easy walk to overhang that this is seen from.....be sure to have someone to tell the story of the how the Lion came to be and how the sculptor supposedly worked some \"suggestions\" in the sculpture to send a message to the people....So much history and the story is fascinating",

          "I really liked seeing the Monument to the Swiss Guards, it is in a beautiful park behind the lake. I enjoyed why the monument was there and see if you can figure out the double meaning of the second animal that is visible. There were a few young people there smoking cannabis in",
          "Even though you will be surrounded by tourists, guides, and many snapping cameras, this is a very touching and beautiful art monument. It truly makes you pause and reflect upon the artist's ability to portray this devastating historical event. A meaningful experience..",
          "This monument is here to commemorate the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution. With the meaning behind it you just can't help but feel the emotions looking at the lion. Even without the meaning behind it, it is a moving monument that has been",
          "We visited this very moving monument twice while we were in Luzern. Because we knew the significance of the monument ( the Swiss guards massacred by the Parisian mob during the French Revolution) it greatly increased our appreciation. Unfortunately, the masses of tour groups",

          "This is a sculpture of dying lion honoring Swiss soldiers who died during the French Revolution. It is in a nice setting in what appears to be a small park. It is in the old town but not easy to find I came across it by seeing a tour group milling around the area.",
          "Interesting piece of art / history hidden close to the city center. Just a few minutes walk from Chapel Bridge and the waterfront. The park area is currently under construction but there is a temporary viewing platform for the monument.",

          "This was near the top of my list to do in Lucerne, and it did not disappoint. While it\u2019s a little off the beaten path, it was still flooded with people and I can only imagine that was because it\u2019s incredibly poignant and majestic. I recommend stopping at a Migros or Coop on the",

          "It is a memorial for those who sacrificed in France during French Revolution. A lion monument in front of a pond. Other than the historical background and the monument, there is really nothing much here. However, there were many tourist buses with groups and groups of Chinese",
          "An impressive monument, that is worthwhile mostly because of the underlying historical aspects. It is emblematic of Luzern. That being said, it is only a statue so do not book your whole afternoon just for that, especially as it is slightly distant from the other main points",
          "No words to describe what one feels as you go in to the area where the Lion Monument is. We went on a beautiful sunny morning. Amazing wok done by artist. The expression on the Lion's face is unreal. TIP: Nice souvenir store right outside of the Monument area. (Casa Grande)",
          "The Lion Monument, Lucerne, Switzerland; the dying lion was engraved on a rock. The lion represents the Swiss Guard, which was massacred while trying to protect Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Walking distance from Lucerne railway station and very close to Chapel bridge.",
          "This is a monument to Swiss guards killed defending the Royals during the French Revolution. But don't just see the monument, check out the park it is in. We recommend starting with this before tackling the Musegg Wall.",
          "You read about this and what a sight to behold!! The sleeping lion memorializes the Swedish mercenaries. Even on a rainy day it is stunning.",
          "Not sure it was worth all the effort as I walked pretty far out of the way but it is beautiful and there are things to see and do nearby",
          "So sad . Read the history before you take a walk to this poignant monument . There is a small park where you can take a pause and be thankful for the men who suffered for freedom.",
          "This is an impressive monument in a beautiful, quiet garden setting. It is located close to shopping and restaurants.",
          "A great rock carving that has interesting history. Nice pool in front to get reflective photos. Free to take photos.",
          "A highlight of Luzure, absolutely beautiful. A true work of art, don\u2019t miss it. Benches available to sit also restroom up the path",
          "The lion is nearly 200 years old and honors the Swiss Guard who died during the French Revolution. The location is in the middle of the city, but is easy to reach. It is a moving and almost emotional sculpture located in a peaceful setting. Some try to find another animal in",
          "I was deeply moved by this sculpture, the way the sculptor created such emotion on the body of this lion. Yes, it gets crowded with tour groups but they don\u2019t stay long. Take the time to sit in the rocks and just look. I stayed an hour. Mark Twain said \u201cthe Lion of Lucerne is",
          "Busy location with people, but an easy walk from the river and worth the effort once you understand the history.",
          "This exquisite sculpture was actually carved right into the marble itself. The lion represents and honors the Swiss mercenaries whose lives were lost. The lion's facial expression is so genuinely strong and suffering at the same time. It is a captivating sculpture you will",
          "A beautiful memorial carved in stone in 1820 in memory of the Swiss Guards that were killed during the French Revolution in Paris. It is one of Switzerland's most visited sites and is probably one of Lucerne's most famous tourist attractions. It is just a short outside of the",
          "This lion is a memorial to the members of the Swiss guard who died in battle in Paris. It\u2019s a lovely and moving tribute.",
          "The story behind this beautiful statute is worth listening to or reading about. And it's absolutely stunning to see it in person. I wouldn't miss it.",
          "Not a great deal to see. Nice monument carved into a cliff but that's about it. It was all over in 5 minutes.",
          "Great statue with really good detail. It\u2019s even better when you read up on why it was made. Really easy walk to get to it. I thought it was going to be a trek, but then looked it up on the maps and saw it was right in the city. All the pics look like it\u2019s out in the",
          "This monument is certainly worth a trip to check out. The perfectly etched stone is very moving, and the entire scene is both impressive and serene. A quick walk from old town as well.",
          "Easy to find. Can either walk or take public transportation to Lion Monument. Be sure to know the story behind the monument before arrival. Very emotional.",
          "A great monument to see, the lion with the spear in it. Our Travel Director told us an additional story..... The artist was told they would receive X amount of money for this work. When he unveiled it, he was given only half the money. He would not ruin his work, but, that",
          "We walked all the way from our hotel to see the famous Lion Monument. The monument itself was impressive. Unfortunately the pond in front of it had been drained on the day we visited, so it was disappointing on the day we visited. We weren\u2019t able to get the pictures we had",
          "The \u201cLion Monument\u201d is another landmark of Lucerne. It is a great work of art, impressive and emotional. It\u2019s worth to see it.",
          "Wonderfully done monument that really captures the emotion of the fallen soldiers. Look for the \"Pig\" but once you see it you will not be able to unsee it.",
          "This is worth a visit in Luzern and the pictures cannot capture the size and detail on this carving in the rock",
          "Lion monument is a wonderful photo scene it's beautifully designed we loved it. It's one of the most visited monument in Lucerne.",
          "Very emtional place. Beautiful site. We went there twice. Very peaceful. Great tribute to the soldiers who did not make it home.",
          "Beautiful setting and beautiful historical carving that represents the Swiss who died protecting the French. The lion is carved in sandstone and rests above a beautiful small pond surrounded by lush green area. A nice stop to relax or bring a lunch.",
          "This is a carving of a giant dying lion in a wall of sandstone rock above a pond at the east end of town. It was designed as a memorial for the mercenary soldiers from Switzerland who lost their lives while serving French king Louis XVI.",

          "Out tour group visited this beautiful monument that honors the Swiss soldiers. It was very interesting and definately worthwhile visiting.",
          "It is a very sad monument to fallen Swiss soldiers in the 1700\u2019s but has more meaning once you learn about the story from the history museum. Visit here first and then come back and view the monument with a fresh perspective.",
          "Went to see the Lion Monument as part of a tour. Well worth the visit. Such a stunning piece of work in a beautiful and serene location.",
          "We visited the Lion Monument once again on our most recent visit to Lucerne. This is a \"must see\" experience when visiting the city. Unfortunately, it is often very crowded with tour groups and visitors. We always walk here from the old town. It is an easy walk but you must",
          "I am not sure I would make a special trip to see it, but if you are in the old town area, it is worth a visit. It won't take long to see and snap a few photos. Read the story behind it before you go... it makes it more meaningful.",
          "Everybody goes there because is in the old town. The story of this monum is funny as Swiss mercenaries died defending the idiot French king... You have to go, nice if you don't have big expectations.",
          "The Lion Monument is dedicated to fallen Swiss guardsmen who died during the French Revolution. It is carved out of stone on site and looks very moving. Said to be one of the busiest tourist spots in Lucerne. Worth one visit.",
          "Must see it in person to appreciate the detail and intricacy that was put into this monument. The meaning behind it is sad and beautiful what they did it for. There may some mosquitoes near it cause of standing water so beware. Other than that it can get crowded if there are",
          "The history of the Swiss mercenary soldiers, and their role in what Switzerland is today, is worth looking into. In addition to the specific story behind this memorial. Adjacent is a great museum and home of the gentleman who discovered the glaciated rock formations while simply",
          "Simple but moving. Recommend reading Mark Twain's description of this monument as it enriches the experience.",
          "This monument is carved into the side of large cliff. The setting is an unexpected oasis in the city. There was little signage about the reason for the monument but it is an impressive work of art. Bonus\u2014free restrooms!",
          "It was very crowded at the Monument when we visited on a late Sunday afternoon, but it was well worth the visit. It really isn't a bad walk from the City Center--no need to take public transportation. My only complaint was that many tourists stood right in front of the Lion,",
          "As the tour guide was telling the story of this great enchanting monument, I couldn\u2019t help not feeling overwhelmed by the beauty not only of what i was seeing but by the story behind it! Its a must see !!",
          "A must see, I guess but it's always too noisy, too crowded... Maybe try visiting on a rainy day? Interesting historical value though.",
          "We found it very moving but depressing. It is helpful if you know the reason for the sculpture beforehand because there is nothing there to explain it to you. We were there at 2pm on a Tuesday and there was only a dozen people there, amazing. You only need 5 minutes here. If you",
          "It's an interesting monument. If you don't have a tour guide you won't understand the full story and details behind it.",
          "It\u2019s a very nice place to visit, full of emotions! It was crowded but there are plenty of spots to take pics!",
          "A fantasic sculpture in a solid rock cliff face. The adjacent glacier museum is fantastic, as is the bizarre house of mirrors in the museum garden. Sounds lame but don't miss it. The area in front of the lion monument can be PACKED with insanely noisy tour groups, so try to",
          "Go! Go! Go! definitely worth trip. I know you think what can be so exciting about a lion Monument. The detail and the questions about which way he is looking. Which way he is about to pounce. The gardens. The area around that you must see. Just GO!",
          "it is a beautiful monument carved into the wall with a pool of water in front. simple, beautiful, powerful.",
          "Visited the statue and was amazed of the craftsmanship and eye for detail which was put in the carving. Sorry to see that there was no sign or marker to tell the story behind it. (Of if it was there it was not obvious to find it)",
          "If you find the right time without huge tourist groups (maybe when it's not the best weather) then this is a nice place visit. With a stroller I wouldn't go there on a nice weekend. The tourists don't leave you any space and don't even realise that they block the whole way with",
          "This monument to Swiss mercenary soldiers was carved into the sandstone rock wall in the early 1800's. The detail by the artist is spectacular and is definitely worth visiting while in Lucerne. It's background story is tragic, but very interesting. Take a few minutes to read",
          "Every tourist group was here when we visited. The lion monument was different. Would I advise visitors to go there, probably not.",
          "Beautiful statue and great history. Story behind the carving is very tragic. The French soldiers fought a valiant fight.",
          "A very worthwhile short walk from the river to see this sculpture. The expression on the face of the lion is incredibly sad.",
          "This is one of those don't-miss spots in Luzern, just a short walk up from the lake. Whoever was on the right or wrong side of history, the Lion is also one of the most moving pieces of memorial sculpture you will see. He is a tribute to the 1,000 Swiss Guards - then working",
          "You don't need to spend long here - but the history is so interesting (& sad) & it really is remarkably beautiful. We were doing a European tour, so were able to explain the link between the Swiss Guard at the Vatican, as well as the relevance of the Tuileries in Paris to this",
          "Fascinating to see the crying lion carved into the stone. A wonderful memorial to the fallen soldiers.",
          "Not overly large or artistically stunning it is a must see because of the back story. A lone surviving Swiss Guardsman created this tribute to his fallen comrades. Easy to get to, free and has public free WCs(toilets)",
          "Come early in the morning or in the evening for a quiet moment to remember those fallen so long ago.",
          "The lion monument in certainly grand and worthy of a picture. I doubt though many people are aware of its significance - a monument to Swiss Guard killed during the French revolution. It looks as though it is guarding the lake in front of it. Make sure to stop off if visiting",
          "This monument doesn't have as much of an impact without a qualified tour guide to explain it to visitors. Yes, independent visitors will find plaques to explain what this monument commemorates, but a tour guide who knows the history of Switzerland and the Swiss Guard will be",
          "This monument is very striking and sad to look at. I am glad I visited. Easy to get to even for handicap.",
          "I was not very keen on visiting the place due to unimpressive reviews. But, the place changed my mind. Go for the history. It\u2019s awesome.",
          "The lion is very impressive monument, but many tourists seem to know nothing about its history. They take pictures and selfies, as if it was just a Disney lion. How stupid!",
          "It is a sad lion and the sculpture has never been finished (edges) because the sculptor has not need paid enough. It is beautiful and it definitely worth visiting",
          "Pretty interesting landmark with very fine scupture work . Good photo op in a lively part of Lucerne .",
          "Wait for the tour groups to pass and find the bench on the hill and enjoy this wonderful sculpture. Also a good restroom break!",
          "It is an easy walk and free from anywhere in Lucerne. Beautifully done and a must to see..It is dedicated to the 800 Swiss mercenaries that were killed in the French Revolution.",
          "Lion monument was great to see, very busy place, lots of tourist, get to see it early then head to the museum by the lion.",
          "Before you go to visit the Lions you would be well off to research its history. We were fortunate to have a tour guide who gave us the backstory and that made this monument all the more impressive. It is simple yet the face of the lion is profoundly moving. Worth the stop on a",
          "This is a monument to Swiss solders that died in a battle. It is very peaceful, even with a minimum one coach load of people there all the time. The lion is beautifully carved and it under it is a list of the dead The pond and gardens are very pretty.",
          "This is a must see. The history of the monument is so cool. Enjoyed my visit there. Highly recommend !",
          "The pictures don't do this monument justice. It must be seen. Beautiful. Easy five or so minute walk the beginning of Old Town.",
          "Lion Monument (or L\u00f6wendenkmal, in German) is a very big statue (twice the real measure) obviously of a Lion, which is located in Lucerne, a city in Switzerland. It is located close to Gletschergarten and Bourbaki Panorama, so if you comr the city, a visit of these three points",
          "We found nothing too gr8 about d place. It was quite and peaceful but nothing so special to visit. Just spent 10-15 mins.",
          "A monument of much significance to the Swiss but also a sculpture of great beauty. Very moving. Take a walk to this end of town and spend a few minutes contemplating what it represents and appreciating the artistry.",
          "A must see. This monument is beautifully sculpted and brings a tear to the eye when you know it's history.",
          "This was one of my favorite spots in all of our trip to Switzerland. Words don't speak well enough for this monument. It was stunning and sad. I'll never forget it.",
          "I was walking around the old center when i reached this point. Besides the awesome sculpture, is a very calm place where you can hang for a wile to rest from walking",
          "The reason this memorial is here is to honor the dead of a long ago war. It's not to have fun, take selfies, act like a tourist. It deserves all the respect possible.",
          "Visited during my Europe Tour Apr-May 2016 and found the assorted ducks and swans quite attractive nearby it. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution - so told the guide.",
          "TLDR version: Lion awesome, story awesomer, worth the walk! Full version: \"The saddest and most moving piece of rock in the world.\" -Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) I would like to be able to describe it more poetically, but one of the greatest authors in the history of American",
          "The lion monument is well worth a visit, it is quite moving and a strangely peaceful location if you go early and manage to avoid the crowds.",
          "A moving monument to the Swiss soldiers who were killed in France during the French Revolution. Try to visit it when not too busy.",
          "A stunning sculpture in a pretty park. Lots of shade to relax if you want to. The public WC is \"interesting\". The little water spout to the left of the Lion gives lovely chilly water from underground. OK to drink or just wash your hands with.",
          "We were But tight on time but none the less visited this attraction, though briefly. It is in a tricky part of town to drive to and best to leave your car away and walk a bit. The monument itself is worth a visit and try and grasp a bit about that history to make the trip",
          "This beautiful stone carving is truly breathtaking, especially when you pay particular attention to the numerous and intricate details the sculptor has deftly included. It is especially moving when you're aware of the backstory, the massacre of the Swiss Guards during the",
          "The monument is pretty good and the gardens are nice, but it's not somewhere you need to spend a lot of time. It's around 10 minutes walk from the centre of Lucerne.",
          "I usually find monuments like this a little underwhelming but this one was surprisingly good. I\u2019m glad I visited it! The Lion Monument, a powerful memorial, pays homage to the selfless heroes of the Swiss Guard. On 10 August 1792, 1,000 of them were killed by revolutionaries",
          "This lion is just awesome. Great to see in daylight and is subtly lit for night. Easy walk from the station.",
          "This is in Lucerne. The wounded lion is a symbol of courage & valor of the soldiers. It's a tribute to them. There is no entrance fee to see it. A must see place in Lucerne. Its a beautiful piece of sculpture.",
          "Very interesting relief carving of a lion but was a bit underwhelmed after reading about it and hearing from other who had been there. It is said to be the equivalent of Mount Rushmore but I would say it doesn't come close.",
          "Our guide had explained the monument prior to visit and we were expecting Mt. Rushmore size and got something much less. However it was interesting even though it seemed a bit out of place in the town. History was the most interesting part.",
          "A must do. Saw the sad lion.Nicely engraved on the wall its easily walkable from the main square. You pass some superb shopping windows..",
          "A stunning carving in the rock wall. It's very impressive and represents a part of Swiss history. Just make sure you go early if possible to avoid any tour groups. It's free to visit as well.",
          "Very easy to walk here. This was a quick stop to snap some pics and continue on our way. We went early morning to avoid crowds and it was empty",
          "It's a beautiful place with the lion sculpture, but the lake could be better cared. The history behind the monument is very important, since the lion represents the Swiss soldiers that were dead in French revolution.",
          "The monument itself is very nice, depicting an important part of history but the place is crowded as heck. I don\u2019t understand why people have to pose in front of this for mutiple pictures making the viewing experience a nightmare.",
          "The lion monument is carved directly into the cliff. The lion is wounded to represent all the soldiers that were killed. It\u2019s a nice spot to take some pictures with the lion reflecting into the water. If you\u2019re in the area, it\u2019s worth a short visit.",
          "Of course a must visit place in Lucerne. It's beautiful & makes you feel connected to the place because of it's history. Try going early morning or late evening to avoid crowd. It's a great place to enjoy sunset too.",
          "This is a quick stop to take in a little history of Lucerne's independence. This is carved from a solid piece of sandstone directly into the cliff. It commemorates the cities independence and a must see fountain. Easy to access walking or city bus.",

          "I was in Luzern to attend the Roger Hodgson concert but also had time for a bit of sightseeing. This monument by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen was right around the corner from my hotel so, being Danish, I thought I would have a look. I was met by a crowd of tourists making",
          "This is a monument to Swiss soldiers who were killed protecting the French king during French Revolution.it is out of single rock and uniquely designed",
          "We visited while we were on a walking tour of Lucerne. The monument is a dedication to the brave soldiers of Switzerland.",
          "The most amazing carving out of the cliff face. A marvel of emotion in a piece of sculpture. A work of art to behold. A heartfelt tribute to so many who tragically lost their lives so long ago. It was an honour to absorb the immensity of the work, & the history. Photos don\u2019t do",
          "The Lion Monument is a massive carving of a dying lion in sandstone rock above a pond. This memorial was designed in to honour the Swiss troops who tried to defend the royal family of King Louis XVI during the French Revolution and who helped the royal family to escape. The",
          "This monument commemorates a sad event and does so with artistic style and grace. A must see stop in Lucerne.",
          "It\u2019s my second time in Lucerne and also my second time visiting this monument after around 30 years. I still find the monument and the vicinity beautiful. There are seats there and if you have time, you should take a seat and just enjoy the moment and take it all in - the",
          "Glad we went, does not take a lot of time and no charge. Take #1 bus from train station. Three stops, the name of the stop is Lion Monument. Leaving the bus walk left 45 degrees up the hill. It is in a park. Had a very good pizza at Caravelle just below the park.",
          "I'm not sure if it was worth spending 30 mins to get to this place as we only spent about 10 mins at the monument. There is nothing really to do here other than just look at the wall with the lion on it. As we had nothing to do, we went to the glacier museum right next to it and",
          "It is not too far from town center and certainly different from most monuments you may see. It is larger than you might expect before visiting. A guide will point out its significance.Created to honor Swiss Guards killed in 1792 during the French Revolution.It's very well done.",
          "Lovely area and tribute monument to Switzerland from France. It\u2019s in a beautiful small garden in a good cafe and shopping area. It can get very crowded with tourists but nice to see",
          "This monument has been made( monolithic) to celebrate the bravery of soldiers who guarded the French king during French Revolution ...the sculptor supposed to have been not paid in full ... in protest he made a small pig outline behind the lion..,visible only if you watch keenly.",
          "It was so crowded when we went, I really couldn't enjoy the monument. I'm suggesting you go early or late to avoid the crowds. I would probably increase my rating if I had an opportunity to return during a less crowded time.",
          "Truly a moving monument, the lions expression says it all. Heart breaking, It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, monument that expresses the pain and suffering the occurred to the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during",
          "My wife and I enjoyed our visit here, and took some nice pictures. Taking some time to understand why this sculpture was made and what the scene represents helped us enjoy this very sad but moving piece of art. The location is very peaceful, and I would recommend a visit, not",
          "This is a monument to fallen soldiers and looking at the lion just makes you feel the anguish the city felt for their men who died. It is a short worthwhile walk to see. Hint: look for the pig and then look up the story.",
          "A very beautiful stone carving. Read the history before you visit. If you visit Lucerne, this is must. And there is no cost to visit.",
          "A short 10 minute walk from the old city, the lion monument is a hidden oasis that is well worth visiting. Not taking long, or taking as long as you want, it is incredible to see the carving in the wall, above the lake that was completed in 1792. Why not pay your tributes to",
          "This lion sculpture is beautifully done and well worth a visit. Understanding the story behind it will make the experience much more worthwhile. It is a monument to the Swiss Guards who laid down their lives in the service of King Louis XIV of France.",
          "I can\u2019t comprehend why this is a popular sight to visit. This is a lion carved out of stone on the side of a rock face.",
          "The Lion Monument is one of those places that has to be experienced in person to truly be appreciated. Prior to visiting I had no expectation of how it would make me feel. A powerful monument.",
          "Beautiful and very moving monument which is well worth seeing on a trip to Lucerne. Sadly like just about everything else in the city it is being ruined by tour groups with selfie sticks. We were lucky that there were only a few people when we visited but we then went to the bar",
          "This sculpture of a wounded lion is, as many have said, a nice piece of art. The immediate area is undergoing some renovation which doesn\u2019t impede the view. Although most tours make this a \u201cmust see\u201d stop, it\u2019s worth a few minutes if you\u2019re doing the Lucern Old Town walking",
          "The sculpture of the dying lion on the rock face stirs one with a tinge of sadness. The entry is free and there is a beautiful landscape around it. There are two other tourist spots, the Glacier Garden and the Bourbaki Panorama close by along with some souvenir shops. It\u2019s a",
          "We were on a walking tour of Lucerne were we stopped by this site just an ordinary point with a crying Lion sculpted in the wall but I guess architecture/ history lovers would appreciate",
          "A short walk from the centre of town, and at least worthy of a visit. It is a great piece of art rather than just a sculpture, but somethings not appreciated by those around.",
          "Really cool statue carved out of the mountain. It gets pretty busy in the small park, but it\u2019s certainly worth the visit.",
          "We took the train to Lucerne to see the Chapel Bridge, the old City and this monument. It's breathtaking. And a quick walk from the train Depot.",
          "Now, in contrast to the city centre, this place is full of tourists so be sure to get their early. There will most likely be a ton of asian tourists using selfie sticks to take photos and people will be bumping into you. Bring comfortable walking shoes. It's a really cool",
          "This monument is nestled between buildings and is an easy walk from the waterfront. You would need to know the history of this monument to understand the significance of it. Our tour guide explained it to us.",
          "The lion monument is an iconic monument of Lucerne and a must visit. They also have a museum which is free if you have a Swiss pass like most museums in Switzerland. The beginning part of the museum is preserved parts of the glaciers that used to be present there in the ice age",
          "People who come in buses are only bought here it seems as one come across bus after bus of tourists visiting this place to have picture clicked with the monument. This was built in memory of soldiers killed in WW.",
          "Make sure you read up on the history behind prior to your visit, otherwise you'll have wasted your time. The sculpture is all there is to the monument, nothing much. It is a short walk from the piers at the lake. You will need maybe 15 minutes to take photos and have a look.",
          "That is the translation of the \u2018HELVETIORUM FIDEI AC VIRTUTI\u2019 inscription engraved above the grotto. The head of a spear sticking out from the side of the lion is the cause of its suffering and its eventual death. It may go unnoticed at first glance. Interpreted differently",
          "The Lion of Lucerne is an important part of visiting the city. It\u2019s actually quite impressive, with the lion\u2019s sad tears bemoaning the death of 752 Swiss soldiers in 1792 as in fact the lion dies from a stab wound. There are many layers of symbolism. When you visit, pray that",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful carving in stone...Lucerne isn\u2019t a big place so not too far a walk for most but it is all that is there other than a souvenir shop.",
          "Read the story behind the sculpture. It is interesting. Then when you arrive, try to contemplate what the artist was trying to achieve. Take a pic and move on. Nothing else much to see or do there. I highly recommend going early and taking a pic by yourself. Otherwise, it is a",
          "It's a status of a crying lion.. It's not really worth going out of the way to see. Unless you are particularly interested in that period in history.. Even then.",
          "The lion monument is one of the most famous spots to visit in Lucerne and I was not one to miss the same. The Lion monument is engraving done on the rock commemorating the Swiss Guards who died during the French Revolution protecting the Royal family.. The spot is in old part",
          "My wife and I were recently on a Tour of Austria and Switzerland and had a tour of The Lion Monument. Our Tour Director Lucy gave us the fascinating story behind the mon-ument and the details that led up to its creation. While we were there, the area became extremely congested.",
          "This is a quick visit but I would say a must see. Very impressive carving into the side of the cliff. Much larger than we thought it would be. An easy walk from town.",
          "Celebrating an ancient war end, this monument in the old town is carved directly on a large rock formation, behind a small pond.",
          "You don\u2019t need to be here long, but it\u2019s part of the history of Luzern, so worth the short walk from the centre of town.",
          "We went in the dark so it wasnt crowded but you could get a good view even then. Water in front of it so dont fall in. Lion carved in the wall.",
          "Another reminder to me of our trip to Lucerne, I was touched by the story of this very well done art carving. For some reason, probably the French Revolution, I think about the classic \"Tale of Two Cities\" whenever I think about this Art. If you visit Lucerne, you must stop for",
          "This was the farthest location on our walking excursion and the sites there and back are for sure worthwhile. Not sure I would have made the trip just for this monument but worth it if you are nearby. Pretty crowded on a nice day as well so hard to get a good pic.",
          "Very impressive carving in a rock and the meaning of it , it takes two seconds to Visit and is totally worth it, many shops and restaurants along the area.",
          "This is a must see in Lucerne and is well worth the walk. the statue is beautifully done and very moving.",
          "Very strange monument and even I read the mening of it I dont understand it. It is nice doen and a new place.",
          "The nicest thing about the monument is that it is a close walk from the lake promenade so you can go and quickl look at it. Its nice and surrounded by a lake, but nothing spectaculour.",
          "I went after 8 years and still feel an attachment of unknown reasons . The weather was awesome and beauty of this art work is unpaealleled",
          "Lion Monument is located in Lucerne city. This attraction has a bit of history associated with it. Lion stands in honour of a Swiss soldier who defended French king during French Revolution. This lion lays in pain after being hit by an arrow. The pain can be visibly seen on",
          "Lucern is so easy to walk around and everything is close to the main downtown area. Check out the Lion Monument because it has a good story and is quite pretty. Then, go into the glacier museum that's right there.",
          "Lion monument is worth the visit if in Luzern, but it pays to be aware of what the monument is about",
          "It was bigger than I thought. Great detail and showed so much emotion just from a rock carving. Went in the evening, not crowded.",
          "We saw this on a walking tour with Viking and it was very pretty. The carving is beautiful and much larger than it appears",
          "Worth the visit! This lion stands in honor of the Swiss guard that defended the French King during the French Revolution. Hurt by an arrow, the lion lays in pain... the work of the statue is excellent. The pain in the lion\u2019s face is evident. The choice of a lion to represent the",
          "Worth taking a walk by and some pictures but not a lot to do other than that. It is a beautiful carved monument and a landmark.",
          "The photos don't do this justice. It means more when you read up about it so you recognise the symbology of the details and appreciate the history behind it. The lion looks magnificent. The city should do more to spruce it up to make it worthy",
          "This monument is so well done that you feel like crying just to see the pain on this lions face. Of course it is in honor of the Swiss Guard who have lost their life in the call of duty. But the artist has done an amazing job on this monument. Seeing this work of art will stay",
          "A somber moment experienced by all in the group, an incredible feat of work carved into stone, to be viewed by day and night for contrast - the heart felt story of the Swiss fallen soldiers that gave them their lives staying loyal to French King, that cost this country a great",
          "This statue of a huge dead lion is a military monument to 700 Swiss soldiers who gave their lives fighting for France. Most people do not notice the rock frame around the statue which appears as an outline of a pig.",
          "If you visit luzerne and have a time , worth visiting, not much to spend rather to take some pictures",
          "When you are in Luzern, be sure to walk over to see this monument carved into the granite. It\u2019s very moving and huge. I\u2019d recommend you read about it first. I always make a stop here to sit and ponder on my trips to Luzern. Plan to stay at least 15 minutes or more and that way",
          "It is a sad story and well worth visiting. It is an easy bus ride from old town and the Glacial Garden is right there.",

          "This lion monument was carved out of solid rock to memorialize the Swiss Guard troops that were killed while protecting the French monarchy. My wife and I found this monument to be one of the most moving places we have ever visited. The stone carving work is outstanding, and",
          "Definitely worth a stop while in town. Nice large carving into the stone with pool of water below, nice peaceful setting",

          "We hadn\u2019t seen the Lion Monument since 2007, our first time. My wife and I enjoyed this visit and its surroundings since we weren\u2019t on a group tour this time. It\u2019s history is always worth learning again and I would recommend it to everyone visiting Lucerne the first time.",
          "The lion Monument is amazing and the story is interesting as well. Worth the hike off the main sections to see it but I would not recommend the glacier museum. Save your time and money unless you have a lot of both.",
          "This place is within walking distance from Chapel Bridge. The monument is to commemorate the fighting of Swiss Guard to protect King of France in French Revolution. It's free and worth for taking photos.",
          "The Dying Lion monument is definitely worth seeing when in Lucerne. It is beautifully carved and his mane, nose and tooth are particularly detailed. It is set behind a lake so you can only view from a distance, but its impact is great - the symbolism is very moving. This is a",
          "Must-see place in Lucern. Dying lion monument is really impressive. It is hidden in the garden in the center of Lucern.",
          "This monument is a spectacular and poignant. I've never seen a monument carved into a cliff/rock face before, and it was particularly moving. It is also a well shaded spot, and nice for a little rest.",
          "This seemed like a nice monument until the story with the connection of this town to the French Revolution. Then this place became sombre and sad. Well worth seeing and hearing the story.",
          "We\u2019ve been sightseeing Luzern and the Lion was on the map. Yes, it\u2019s huge. But not something you shouldn\u2019t miss. Yes, M. Twain said... Well, maybe only if you understand the meaning of the monument. I rather appreciate the artistic value. Which didn\u2019t impress me.",
          "Despite the many reviews read prior to our visit, we were glad we did take time to visit this monument. The sculpture was beautifully carved & rather moving especially looking into the details (broken spearhead, suppressed shield). Very symbolic indeed. The Glacier Garden is",
          "We heard of the monument from several people we met at our hotel and some of our guides. We are so glad we took the time to go see it. The monument is just beautiful and upon hearing the history behind we just stood in awe of the loyalty and dedication of the Swiss Guards.",
          "A very short and enjoyable walk from old city. It is an amazing monument carved out of stone with a reflecting pool below it. Places to sit to be contemplative.",

          "Connected to Switzerland history this beautiful lion carved in stone is a place that has to be included in a visit to Luzern. It is somewhat a hidden gem in town. If you go a bit early you may avoid the crowds and enjoy some nice time observing it",
          "In the very centre of Luzern, alongside an Alpine garden you will find this monument of the dying lion resting on a shield marked with French lilies. Overlooking small pond, carved in a rock, the size of a lion is colossal, but the whole site emanates subtle sorrow and peace.",
          "The Lion Monument is a landmark in Lucerne and is close to the city centre. It looks sad and probable longing for the open African savannah !",
          "This monument is a must see in Lucerne, it is beautiful, and moving, the expression on the lion's face tells a story, I sat for quite a while in contemplation. The outline of a pig on the wall surrounding the lion just makes it even more fascinating.",
          "It\u2019s a monument in view of respect to the soldiers. It was five minutes walk from our hotel. It\u2019s one of a kind. No tickets required.",
          "we had a great time there. the place was quiet and yet interesting to view. nice view of course, very special.",
          "I've visited the Lion Monument a number of times, at least three in tour groups. Only once did our guide take the time to help us Americans try and understand its significance. I'm unsure if was just her words or the tears that moved us more. I certainly recommend visiting",
          "By the time we reached the spot of Lion monument , the weather became bad. Sky cloudy with little intermittent drizzle. It was an interesting monument , lots of tourist visiting. A must see in Lucerne visit.",
          "This carving in the rock is really large, and well done. In front of it is a lovely pond, and has a lot of benches to sit and take it all in, and relax for a few minutes. And a big plus, free washrooms adjacent to the pond!",
          "First time to see a Lion sitting with a very sad face hahahahaha, but still place is nice to have some clicks.",
          "This is a nice sculpture of a lion in a rock. It was a stop on our tour of Lucerne. Nice for a picture but not much else to do here. A visit will take less than 15 minutes.",
          "Every time I come to Lucerne I like to visit here. I took my family here recently and we also went to the museum with the hall if mirrors. So fun!",
          "The Lion monument is of historical significance. Other than this, it is quite average and overrated.",
          "This place is completely overrated. We visited this place since it was at a walking distance from our hotel. The place is mostly visited by a lot of group tourist who are told this as a monumental sight seeing spot in old Lucerne. Rest of the Lucerne is extremely beautiful but",
          "A very sad monument in Lucerne, imbued with the tragedy of historical events. The sculpture is very huge in reality.",
          "The lion monument was far more impressive in person than expected. We loved seeing it. Must-see attraction!",
          "This monument signifies the loyalty and bravery of Swiss soldiers to their employee king of France LOUIS XVI. At first glance you can see a lion that is dying. You can notice head of the spear is sticking out from the side of the lion which signifies cause of its suffering and",
          "A must to see, a tribute to honor, bravery, loyalty and courage of the Swiss people. The glacier park is right next door.",
          "Easy to find and reach the Lion Monument from Lucerne Old Town. Its about 10-15 mins walk. Its free of charge. Good to go during the day. Nice place to take pictures and relax. Its quiet and peaceful. A lot of tourists come to this place. There are other tourists attractions",
          "Great for photog buffs or history buffs. Amazing detail and plenty of other things to see and do nearby.",
          "Just looking at him so perfect carved he looks so lonely, beautiful reflections in the pool below. Don\u2019t miss the glacier garden next to the statue with the hall of mirrors",
          "Hidden almost in a suburb this is a beautifully carved memorial to those Swiss who fell in the war as mercenaries for the French.",
          "The sleeping lion carved into the rock was pretty impressive. We ventured into the glacier exhibition which was really interesting as it showed how the rocks had formed over time and the effects of the glacier melting. Work is still being done to cut a walkway through the rocks.",
          "This is a true work of art that captures your heart from the moment you see it. We visited in December when it was easy to see and photograph but I would arrive early if visiting in the spring or summer.",
          "Majestic. Such a sad picture to look at. The detail is amazing. Easy to find and free to experience.",
          "A beautiful tribute to Swiss soldiers, this monument is a must see during any visit to Lucerne. It\u2019s beautifully carved, and it really makes you think. There is no charge to see the monument.",
          "Tucked away in an unassuming corner patch of Lucerne, this lion is so poignant and a real must see. Take a moment to stand and stare before grabbing a delicious coffee and cake in a nearby caf\u00e9.",
          "This tribute to Swiss soldiers was beautiful, thoughtful, and the story inspirational. It was a quick walk to and from the monument. It is worth a visit to see this amazing piece of Swiss history.",
          "A very touching monument to the service rendered by Swiss Guards in France during the French Revolution.",
          "Initially was left worried that I may be left underwhelmed but how wrong I was! There is a quiet beauty in this sculpture and having read the history behind it, it left me moved. I'm glad I visited it.",
          "Amazing carving on the wall !! Big sculpture with a history! Small little venue with WC access. Nothing much around. Walking distance to Train station",
          "A visit to Lucerne would not be complete without paying a visit to the commemorative monument delegated to the some 300 fallen Swiss Guards during the French Revolutions who gave their lives defending Louis the 16th. There is a small pond or lake in front of the monument and",
          "Try to view the lovely Lion Monument which is a moving and memorable tribute to the fallen courageous Swiss guards, who lost their lives defending Louise XVI in 1792, during the French Revolution. It is hewn from rock, and carved into the cliff face of a former sandstone quarry",
          "Easy to find this place. There are few benches around, nice to have a pit stop with coffee and enjoy the monument. If you love history and museum, take time to explore the glacier park and surrounding museum. It can be pretty slippery on a rainy day.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful monument with a nice story behind it located in the center of downtown luzern. Near by it a natural museum. All souvenir shops are nearby it. I advise everyone to visit it and enjoy the best part of this city.",
          "Even though this gets so crowded it\u2019s worth a visit. When you see it in person it truly is amazing. Just stunning.",
          "Beautiful monument in the middle of the city. It can get crowded with tourists but it's worth the hike to see it. It's surrounded by shops and restaurants in case you need refreshments, too.",

          "We walked up to the Lion Memorial and it is beautiful. I did feel that the surrounding area looked a bit run down.",
          "Worth a look as you stroll through the city. This is spot has some historic meaning about the Swiss, but I did not catch the significance.",
          "The lion is a great peace of art with a sad story attached to it, yet it is a must see in Lucerne. We came at about 18:30 and in December it is fully night. The light around is very low so tourists use flash light. Please add some extra light.",
          "An exquisite carving in th stone wall. The history of the carving is most interesting. Look for another animal around the carving.",
          "A beautiful yet somber monument carved into a cliff to commemorate all the fallen French soldiers during the war. It\u2019s a lovely spot to sit and soak in the brevity of what it represents... and to be thankful that we have been able to visit here and be personally thankful!",
          "Not much cab or taxi in lucern. So if you stay near the train station, you need to have a long walk over to see the sad lion. Good to also visit Hofkirche St. Leodegar along the way.",
          "It is a rather sad looking statue, that's for sure. But it's an interesting bit of art and accessible through a nice walk through the city.",
          "The Dying Lion is a monument dedicated to the Swiss Army that tried in vain to protect King Henry. The story is a very sad one and I found it very moving. The is absolutely free and is an easy walk. There is a museum too if you care to visit, it\u2019s a must see while here.",
          "The Lion Monument is a must see for anyone visiting Lucern for the first time. The monument memorializes the Swiss mercenaries that were guarding Louis XIV and the French royal family during the 1792 revolution. There were 1000 mercenaries of which 760 were killed and 350",

          "The monument is impressive, the museum (which we did not enter) looked a bit like a tourist trap. The monument is amazing, a translation would have been nice.",
          "One cannot visit Lucerne without seeing this beautiful, \"saddest and most moving piece of rock in the world\" as Mark Twain quoted. As tribute to the Swiss soldiers who died in the French Revolution in Paris, it is considered one of the world's most famous monuments. It is a",

          "We took a bus from the river and then did the short walk. I had visited about 40 years ago. It is an impressive carving. We were there in November and the crowd was small",
          "If you are a fan of the Danish sculpturer Bertel Thorvaldsen and happen to be visiting Lucerne, then you must stop into the English Garden to view the Lion of Lucerne Monument. This monument is carved into the sandstone cliff of an old quarry and features a dying lion impelled",
          "Maybe its a common monument for the locals. Buy for us that coming from another world its curious to know whats this place. Unfortunately when we came there, the place is dirty and full of dead leaf and garbage in some corner. When the night is coming, this place is dark only a",
          "It was my second time there, the first time was in 2009 this time it was October 2018. Wow what a difference since then, this place was extremely crowded with tourist, jam packed is more like it. I couldn't wait to leave since I was there with a tour group, I couldn't leave",
          "That was really good that we can see such a historical attractions in lucern.I recommend walking in the old city till arriving there.",
          "Worth seeing...its free and it is very well done. It is a picture worth taking, and it is not too long of a walk to get there!",
          "I so looked forward to seeing this touching work of art. It was not what I expected. It's actually quite small, in a busy shopping district, not the quiet and contemplative environment I had imagined. Maybe my expectations were too high. It's a lovely piece, just didni't live",
          "The pig shaped den is quite visible. This is really not a long walk from old town as the maps suggested. Well worth the short walk. The changing leaves in the fall surrounded the monument. Very pretty",
          "A must-see if visiting Lucerne. Visit during the day as it is not lit at night.I wish that it was lit at night, it would be stunning.",
          "This was an amazing monument to see. the sculpture of the lion was done with so much detail, Look close at the sculpture and you will se it is done in the shape of a pig. Lenend has it that the artist was not paid what he thought was worthy of his work.",
          "This statue is carved into the rock face and above a pond, so looks very picturesque. The location is an easy walk from the centre of Luzern and is free! Lots of tourists visit this statue, so getting a good photo without people in it takes a little while. Then it\u2019s a short",
          "By no means a must see, this monument is swarming with tourist groups with leaders talking about the monument so it is not a serene setting to enjoy. The story and sculpture are interesting from an historic perspective. If you have time stop for a few minutes, but it's not",
          "There are no words to describe this moving Lion monument carved out of sandstone. It\u2019s peaceful serene setting compounds the mournful story behind the mortally wounded lion which memorializes the Swiss guards who were killed trying to defend the Tuileries Palace in Paris during",
          "A hidden treasure. A lion craved in stone as a tribute to the Swiss guard who died during the French Revolution. Why go to Switzerland and miss it.",

          "There\u2019s a beautiful pond in front of the monument and the whole atmosphere is really beautiful. We were here in the fall and the colors were absolutely beautiful. You should stop by and see it if you\u2019re in Lucerne.",
          "Go and look at this monument,. Its only a 5 minute walk from the Lake, its free, it tells a story.It's very poignant, very moving and well worth a visit. Carved out of the rock, I found it very sad but very interesting",

          "The Lion monument is hidden away just a 5 minute walk from the chapel bridge and lake Luzern but it is well worth seeking out. A touching tribute to slain Swiss mercenaries it is quite a feet of snow work and set in quiet gardens has quite an impact. A class act.",
          "This was definitely worth the walk and search to find! Had to stop and ask 3 different locals for directions walking to it but it was well worth the effort. Connected to it was a glacier museum which was a pay for attraction but was free as part of our Swiss rail pass but after",
          "Its a short and not difficult walk out here, past some great shops and places to have a dessert on the return. Beautiful setting with great technical accomplishment in the actual carving. The story is poignant as well. Advice: take a lunch with you to enjoy in the park near",
          "This spot is very special, with deep meaning in memory of the valor and sacrifice of the Swiss Guards. Specifically, the regiment killed and massacred in Paris during the French Revolution. If you are familiar with the area of Paris near the Louvre and Tuileries Garden, where",
          "It is a beautiful place, the garden, the fountain and the monument are worth a visit. It is a place where you can find peace and calmness, if you get there before or in between tourist's tours.",
          "This breathtaking monument is so beautiful, specially because of what does it represent. The look of the lion makes you feel all the pain of its history. It is a beautiful and huge sculpture, surrounded by trees and an artificial lagoon. Wonderful piece of art!",
          "When you stay in this beautiful city of lucerne you have to visit the lions monument. A magnetical point. What is missing in the whole city are clean public toilets. That makes the trip to here somehow a bad sight. Here the autority had to initiate a renewal.",
          "What a beautiful piece of art! It\u2019s simply breathtaking. It\u2019s a short walk from the famous chapel bridge and definitely a place worth visiting in Lucerne.",
          "Walked from our hotel next to Chapel bridge to the monumemt. It was an easy 10 min walk. The Dying lion monumemt is located in a small garden. Seeing monument in person turned out to be a moving experience. We read about the history while we sat in the peaceful surrounds. A",
          "Next to the Glacier Garden. The sculpture is touching. From photos, we can't feel the size but it's huge and realistic.",

          "We liked this monument. It is stunning. Our suggestion is to seat on the bench (next to it) and just look at it. Hopefully, the tourist crowds are going to be light.",
          "We visited this originally in 1997 and never thought we would see it again. It was just as awe inspiring the second time and worth the walk from the railway station.",
          "This monument is in a peaceful park. We did not go into the full park, but what we saw was worth the walk to find it. It is close to downtown.",
          "Nothing spectacular about this monument but you probably need to understand with Davis is making this painful lion . It is about describing how the Swiss soldier who is protecting their king and queens with their life . Beautiful scripture and look carefully that the cave looks",

          "Beautiful view",
          "Nothing much to see, but it is a surprise to stumble across and makes you realise that several notable historical figures have visited Weggis over the years. Apparently, it was Mark Twain's favourite spot, which is the reason for the monument.",

          "Great day out facilttated by Sraka Risch, Manager at PIlatus. She has been integral in how I have been able to get some good deals to take my guests up to Pilatus Kulm. She really is a credit to the organisation and for small businesses like mine, she is massively supportive.",

          "This place is really amazing. Weve been keep thinking on how did they manage to install the cogwheel railway going on to the top of the mountain with a 7000ft. As they said Pilatus Railway is the worlds steepest cogwheel railway from Alpnachstad.",
          "This is an excellent place to visit. There is a cog wheel rail to the top. I recommend to come down using the cable car to enjoy a different way down and also it takes lesser time. There is a connection to Lucerne by boat but it takes too long. The connections and times are",

          "Beathtaking. Routes for all physical condition. The cable cars r amazing. There are places on the way up for kids too so families can spend great time here. And you can see goats on the rocks. WE have to return because 3 hours were not enough. Ah not cheap at all but worse every",
          "We went here our first full day in Luzerne. I loved riding the cable car to the top. The scenery from here cannot be captured in a photograph although I tried. We took the cable car up and the cog wheel train down and caught the train back to Luzerne. This is a lovely",
          "This was a little pricey, but the views and experience were incredible. It was summer, and a clear bright day. Great views half way up and at the top. There is a restaurant there and some cafes too. But the highlight for us was at the summit seeing 360 views. Train down was",
          "We rode the train as part of the golden trip from Lucerne. Superb views of the lake and amazing engineering. Top of mount Pilates also worth the trip. Several short trails at the top for all ages and conditions to enjoy the alps. Just spectacular!",
          "This was the highlight of our holiday and a must do this is Swiss engineering at its best how they managed to do this cog railway is beyond me. The views from the top are breathtaking, you can either come back down the same way or come back by cable car which is also worth doing.",

          "We took the Golden Round Trip with a cruise on the crystal clear waters of Lake Lucerne, followed by a ride on the cogwheel train (48% incline) to Pilatus Mountain. On Pilatus, we were astounded by beautiful sights of the mountains at every turn; we hiked to the highest peak,",
          "Great way to tackle the transportation issue up such a angle. The trip is slow and steady wins the race situation, so enjoy the scenic trip while you are on it.",
          "Great trip with the cogwheel car from Alpnachstaaf to Mount Pilatus and with the cable cars down to Kriens, Facilities are rather new or very well maintained. Staff is friendly. It's not cheap but well worth the money. Recommended for any type of traveller, thus a must-see",
          "Were taken there by family. Excellent workmanship. Beautifully executed and planned to take folk up and down at an incline of 48 degrees at times! Not cheap, but worth it.",

          "Great fun though it is a long and slow ride up. We went late in the day when it was rather cloudy/rainy so unfortunately we didn't get to see anything once we got to the top as it was too foggy and gray. Our kids still enjoyed the rides up and down (but I'd wait and go on a",
          "The Pilatus cog rail is the steepest in the world including the older Mt. Washington cog rail. The trains you are riding are from 1937, but since this is Switzerland you just cannot see it. The maintenance makes these trains stand out like they were manufactured yesterday.",

          "This cogwheel railway provides a ride from Alpnachstad to the top of Mt. Pilatus. It is an unique experience riding in a train with a 45 degree incline. It provides spectacular views of the surrounding area. Also, makes for great photos from the windows of the train.",
          "Instead of using the cable car which starts in Kriens we decided to use the cog railway out of Alpnachstad. Weather was fantastic and there were plenty of people who wanted to go up to the top of mountain Pilatus. All was very well organized and perfectly planned. Prices",
          "good place for hikers and family with children because they have play field on the way to the top, and if weather permits highly recommend the run slide!",

          "We took the cable car up to Mt Pilatus, it had snowed the previous day, it was very scenic all around, after reaching on top, one had to go on foot to a higher peak, breathtaking, at the top though it was chilly, one just wanted to stay there and take in the beautiful view as",
          "We took this cog wheel train down the mountain after taking the cable car to the top. They run every 40 minutes and are very crowded, I'd advise to get into the queue 10 mins before it's due. The cars are obviously pretty old but have been extremely well maintained. There are",
          "Even though it was a bit rainy and overcast we decided to go anyway. Took the funicular up and the gondola down. The funicular ride was interesting if just from an engineering point of view. Looking back down there were some great views but nothing compared to the view at the",
          "At the top of the mountain there is a small hotel and cafeteria type restaurant . After the magnificent ride up, it's time for a good Swiss beer and lunch/snack.",
          "We went to 2nd station of pilatus in cable car. It was a short journey but the scenery outside cable car cabin was simply superb. We got the tickets easily. While coming back we preferred to trek downhill.",
          "We so enjoyed the Pilatus Bahn... cog train from Alpnachstad to the top of Mount Pilatus. We took it as part of the golden round trip ticket (ferry, bus, gondola, cable car, cog wheel train back). I would highly recommend this trip and to do it in reverse... take the cog wheel",
          "We had taken the Pilatus Bahn , the famous cog wheel railway starting from Alpnachstad during visit to Mt Pilatus recently. The Bahn makes for an impressive ride given the sharp incline, up to 48 degrees at some places, which the ride traverses. The scene as you go up the Cog",
          "Visited the Pilatus Bahn during recent visit to Switzerland. The trip by cog wheel railway from Alpnachstad to Mt Pilatus was the highlight of out visit. Parking our car at the station parking, we bought our Silver tickets and waited patiently for about 30 minutes wondering if",
          "Amazing is the word that comes to mind. Pilatus railways, hats off to your engineering skills, so you basically take an elevated cogwheel to travel to the top of mountain and then traverse back via cable car, after spending ofcourse as much time as required on the top :) Must",
          "A few minutes outside of Lucerne is the world\u2019s steepest cog railroad. Shortly into the journey up Mount Pilatus, you wonder how much steeper can it get, as some sections of the train loom ahead of you like a wall. The train itself is spacious and reasonably comfortable. The",
          "The unique experience is taking the Pilatus railway, the world's steepest cogwheel railway at maximum 48% gradient .I started my journey by purchasing a round-trip ticket from Lucerne main train station to Alpnachstad by train , then up to Pilatus Kulm on the cogwheel railway ,",
          "Located in Alpnachstad, a 10 minutes train ride from Luzern, the Cogwheel railway is a run way to get to the top of Mount Pilatus, or half-way if you want to hike the rest, which is what we did. This train is the steepest cogwheel ride in the world. It has been around for 125",
          "This is a sight you must see if your in this AG region of Switzerland. It was so beautiful, clean, exciting. I would go again in a second. The gondola rides to the top are spectacular. The air is a bit thin there but still well worth the time.",
          "By all means, if you happen to be in Luzern and the weather is nice, take a trip to the 2100m Pilatus mountain. Go there using the steepest cogwheel mountain railway in the world and enjoy the ride and view. Plan at minimum a half day for the excursion.",
          "45oC ratchet train is something amazing. The view is beautiful and there is a nice restaurant on the top.",
          "Luckily I live at the foot of this mountain which is without doubt one of the best to see in Switzerland. Each level has something to offer each group of tourists. The round trip of: ship, cog-railway (up), peak of the mountain - Pilatus Kulm, cable car and gondola (down), is",
          "Had a great day visiting this beautiful mountain peak above Lucerne. If you can get a window table, take the time to have a meal at the historic Hotel Pilatus-Kulm. Great food, but the view is unparalleled.",
          "The views of snow clad hills, clouds, cities and lucerne lake will take your breath away. It was a wonderful visit through ropeway and cable car. The peak is at more that 7000 feet and you have amazing restaurants at that height for your comfort. Truely amazing,,,",
          "Pilatus bahn is absolutely a best visit in terms of mountains visits in Swiss. Its steepest railway is amazing experience. Even its gondola experience was awesome. It becomes more beautiful in Winter when cloud comes below you where you get feeling of top of the world. Just go",
          "Lucerne is a great day trip from Z\u00fcrich and Mount Pilatus should definitely be on the list of to-dos while there. I went recently during the Winter off-peak season so sadly the boat and cog railway transportation modes were not available - bus/cable car was the only option.",
          "This was once-in-a-lifetime experience, stunning view of the Alps. A must when visiting Luzern! A little on the expensive side though, but well worth it.",
          "Breath-taking beautiful! Only did the cable car. No long waits anywhere. Enough space. Start early and make sure about fog levels and clouds on the Pilatus website before going.",
          "Great experience at 45% incline, it is unforgettable experience. either up or down to Pilatus. the Price ? 244 Euro for family of 4! But, if you can buy the swiss pass do so! it will save you the money.",
          "I was forced to sit separately from my wife, otherwise 5/5. When we arrived the station worker asked for us to get into a car that was able to leave. We simply boarded and found out that the compartment, capacity eight, were occupied by three couples, knowing each other.",
          "Titilis is the tallest peak in Switzerland and certainly boasts some breath-taking scenery, but the combo for this trip gives it a good run for its money. Before heading up to the top, be sure to check the webcam on Pilatus' website. It can give you a live view so you can check",
          "Smashing scenic railway ride, can get off and walk between various stations, many do. You can save money on the return by paragliding back down!",
          "The worlds steepest cog-wheel railway ! I begis pretty steep , you can see that the vagons are made for a steep journey, but its getting even steeper after just a few minutes travel ! It steepst part is 48 % ! It is uimaginablly steep , and the veiw is stunning , all the way up",
          "This is a not to be missed attraction in Switzerland. Buy the \"golden roundtrip\" ticket from any train station. You will depart from Luzern (across from the train station) by boat for a glorious 1 and a half hour trip down lake Luzern to Kriens. There you will embark on one of",
          "Drinking Riesling wine and observing the mountains - mmmmmmmmm! Absolutely liked it. We even fed birds and saw wild mushrooms... It's adorable.",
          "We went up the day before we went to Jungfrou and this mountain is just as good, no snow when we went but great views, the cog train was awesome and the cable car was even better. totally recommend this mountain, even if you don't get the jungfrou this will be just as exciting.",

        "wiki": "The B\u00fcrgenstock is a mountain in Switzerland (1,115 m above sea level) located partway along the shore of Lake Lucerne. B\u00fcrgenstock is also a resort located at 874 m a.s.l. on the same mountain. The lookout point at the summit of the B\u00fcrgenstock, the Hammetschwand, offers an extensive view, for the mountain is almost entirely surrounded by Lake Lucerne.\nThe small resort B\u00fcrgenstock can be reached by a road as well as with the B\u00fcrgenstock Funicular which starts from the boat landing pier at Kehrsiten-B\u00fcrgenstock on Lake Lucerne. The highest summit of the B\u00fcrgenstock can be reached from the resort by foot and by means of a cliff-side path followed by the Hammetschwand Elevator.\nThe new B\u00fcrgenstock resort featuring 30 buildings, including three hotels with around 400 rooms (800 beds), 68 Residence Suites and 12 restaurants and bars is under construction. Of the total investment of CHF 485 million, CHF 320 million has already been expended. It reopens 2017.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWhen looked at from Lucerne, the B\u00fcrgenstock has the typical mountain shape of a \"stock\". Especially in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the term \"Stock\" is used for a number of mountains whose shape of summits is clearly set off from the bulk. A good example is Stockh\u00fctte\nThe term B\u00fcrgenstock, composed of the descriptive words \"B\u00fcrgen\" and \"Stock\", has evolved since the mid-19th century into the geographical name for the distinctive mountain on the \"B\u00fcrgen\" peninsula as seen from Lucerne.\nFrom the early Middle Ages on, the mountain on this peninsula was called B\u00fcrgenberg; an arbitral settlement from the year 1378, putting an end to over 38 years of dispute between the estates Lucerne and Nidwalden about the affiliation of the region extending from Kehrsiten to Mattgrat, uses the name B\u00fcrgenberg in its records.Old maps and frontier records of the Corporation of Lucerne which mention the \u2013 in those times \u2013 disputed forest call it the Stadtwald am B\u00fcrgenberg (forest on the B\u00fcrgenberg) or B\u00fcrgenbergwald (B\u00fcrgen mountain forest).On the Dufourkarte (Dufour Map), the topographic map of Switzerland from 1844 to 1864, the mountain ridge as a whole had no name. The highest crest was referred to as Hametschwand.\nThe geographical name B\u00fcrgenstock was first documented in the year 1836 by Aloys Businger in his book \u201cDer Kanton Unterwalden\u201d. Businger calls the entire B\u00fcrgen peninsula the B\u00fcrgenberg; however, he refers to the highest elevation both as Hammetschwand and B\u00fcrgenstock.In addition, in the year 1850, the Director of the Lucerne Teacher's Training College Niklaus Rietschi published a private map, in which the terms B\u00fcrgenstock together with the term Hammetschwand are recorded for the summit.In 1872, the company Bucher & Durrer laid the foundation for the hotel complex on the Alp Tritt. For this purpose, it chose the already existing geographical name of B\u00fcrgenstock, also documented in 1836 by Aloys Businger in his book \u201cDer Kanton Unterwalden\u201d.The first official map to use the geographical name B\u00fcrgenstock was the so-called \u201cSiegfriedkarte\u201d Siegfried Map, whose publication, started by the Federal Topographic Bureau under Hermann Siegfried, continued from 1870 until 1926. The name B\u00fcrgenstock appears on sheet 377 of the Siegfried Map and dates back to 1896.Around 1900, the designation B\u00fcrgenstock established itself as a general colloquial term for the entire mountain ridge, from Stansstad in the West to \"Untere Nase\" in the East. A corresponding entry in the \"Geographischen Lexikon der Schweiz\" (Geographical Dictionary of Switzerland) can be found in 1910.In the Swiss maps of our days, the name B\u00fcrgenstock designates the mountain ridge \u2013 with the term Hammetschwand as alternative \u2013 as well as the location of the hotel and residential complex. B\u00fcrgenstock as a geographical name can be found twice in the official Swiss index of cities and towns. The locality B\u00fcrgenstock is listed in the postal code listing of Switzerland under the postal code 6363. Today, the residential streets of the valley communities Stansstad and Ennetb\u00fcrgen, connecting the entire mountain ridge, carry the name B\u00fcrgenstockstrasse.\n\n\n== Geographical situation ==\nThe B\u00fcrgenstock is a mountain ridge that stretches over 10 km and is surrounded to the north, east and southeast by Lake Lucerne. The northern slope drops very steeply into the lake. On and at the bottom of the southern slope is the township of Ennetb\u00fcrgen; Stansstad is situated at the bottom of the western end.\nFor the most part, the mountain belongs to the municipality of Ennetb\u00fcrgen in the canton of Nidwalden. The western part belongs to the municipality of Stansstad. A part of the northern steep drop into the lake is an exclave of the city of Lucerne and is called B\u00fcrgenberg (aka citizen's mountain).\n\n\n== Geology ==\nGeologically, the B\u00fcrgenstock belongs to the foothills of the Pilatus and the Helvetic border chain. The rocks are from the Cretaceous and Tertiary. Below the Hammetschwand, the following layers can be distinguished on the north side: siliceous limestone, Drusberg layers (forming a forest belt), bright Schrattenkalk limestone with orbitolina layers overlaid by Seewerkalk limestone.\nAbove this there is a transgression of Assilina Greensand and Nummulitic limestone of the Lutetian age, which is found mainly on the southern downward slope with its gentler incline.During the last ice age, the B\u00fcrgenstock was completely covered by an ice stream flowing from the Gotthard into the foothills of the Alps. Abrasion marks left by the ice on the limestone are found including in the highest altitudes. Large granite boulders which were transported by the ice from the Gotthard, are distributed over the whole mountain, as for example an 18 m3 large, round specimen on a steep slope on the Allw\u00e4gli land reserve, which in 1949 was placed under protection. After the regression of the ice, the B\u00fcrgenstock was at first an island in Lake Lucerne. In the course of a few thousand years, however, the Engelberger Aa River filled up the area between the Engelberger valley entrance and the B\u00fcrgenstock with sediments, creating today's flat valley between the townships Ennetb\u00fcrgen, Buochs, Stans and Stansstad.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nHome to a number of luxury hotels and a conference centre, the B\u00fcrgenstock has been a popular holiday and conferencing destination since 1872. Also located on the B\u00fcrgenstock is Europe's tallest outdoor lift: the Hammetschwand Lift connects the beautiful scenic cliff path with the Hammetschwand vantage point, from where extensive views of Lake Lucerne and the surrounding mountains are to be had.\nA protection plan is in place for the B\u00fcrgenstock to safeguard its testimony to Switzerland's post-Second World War tourism heritage. Alongside the Grand Hotel and Palace Hotel, this comprises numerous smaller buildings erected in the 1950s and 1960s. The Office of Historical Monuments of the canton of Nidwalden, the owners, Nidwalden's cantonal council (in NW: German: Regierungsrat) and the municipality's government sought successfully to preserve the historical buildings by establishing a committee mandated with developing a master plan to place the buildings under heritage protection. The historical weather station has since been relocated to a different site. The Grand Hotel, the oldest establishment in the B\u00fcrgenstock Resort, has undergone partial demolition, although its facade is now being rebuilt to match the original and the interior features a new, up-to-date room layout. From a historical perspective, it was deemed important that the B\u00fcrgenstock resort should continue to make its presence felt within the Lake Lucerne region through its distinctive silhouette, and be kept as an ensemble of buildings.\n\n\n== History of the hotel complex ==\nIn 1871 the Bucher & Durrer Company, domiciled in Kerns, bought Alp Tritt on Mount B\u00fcrgenberg. The company named its new hotel venture \"B\u00fcrgenstock\". The Hotel Kurhaus, later called the Grand Hotel, opened on 23 June 1873. A small hydroelectric power plant on the Engelberger Aa river was built in Buochs in 1886/7 to power the B\u00fcrgenstock funicular railway and the Stanserhorn aerial cableway. The railway commenced operations in 1888, as did the hotel's own water supply. That same year saw the opening of the Park Hotel. The B\u00fcrgenstock Chapel dates from 1897. The Palace Hotel opened in 1904, and a number of villas emerged east of it between 1900 and 1905. The Hammetschwand Lift was inaugurated in 1905.\nFriedrich Frey-F\u00fcrst bought the B\u00fcrgenstock hotels in 1925. The period 1925 to 1948 saw the three hotels subjected to thoroughgoing renovations and the golf course opened in 1928. Friedrich Frey-F\u00fcrst died in 1953, at which point his son Fritz Frey took charge under whose direction various structural and infrastructural changes were made. During his tenure and that of his family, celebrities including actors Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn and Sean Connery and politicians such as Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger stayed as guests at the hotels.\nThe family sold the B\u00fcrgenstock Resort to the UBS in 1996. It was acquired in 2000 by Richemont H\u00e9ritage SA of Vich, Canton Vaud together with five other five-star hotels indebted to the UBS to the tune of some CHF 115 million. The company changed its name to Rosebud Hotels Holding SA in 2003 after disposing of its eponymous Hotel Richemont. The Barwa Real Estate Company, domiciled in the Emirate of Qatar, took up a 50% holding in the company's assets in 2007 which, alongside the B\u00fcrgenstock hotels, comprised the Schweizerhof in Bern and the Royal-Savoy in Lausanne. On separating from Rosebud Hotels Holding SA in 2008, the Barwa Real Estate Company became sole proprietor of the B\u00fcrgenstock Resort. There followed a new concept under manager Bruno H. Sch\u00f6pfer. In 2009 the Barwa Real Estate Company transferred its Swiss hotel portfolio to the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company, which is wholly owned by the State of Qatar; its subsidiary, QDHP Swiss Management AG, became responsible for managing the hotel projects. Katara Hospitality, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 the State of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund \u2013 became the new investor in 2011. The same year saw the launch of the B\u00fcrgenstock Selection brand identity, which incorporates the new B\u00fcrgenstock Resort, the Hotel Royal-Savoy in Lausanne and the Hotel Schweizerhof in Bern. The Swiss activities were transferred in 2012 to Katara Hospitality Switzerland AG; domiciled in Zug, the company operates the hotels in Switzerland. Since 2013, 72 of the 74 building licences applied for have been issued and more than CHF 120 million invested.\nThe Hotel Honegg has been renovated and reopened in 2011.The cornerstone of the new B\u00fcrgenstock Resort was laid on 26 March 2014. A car-free resort featuring 30 buildings, including three hotels with around 400 rooms (800 beds), 68 Residence Suites and 12 restaurants and bars is under construction. Of the total investment of CHF 485 million, CHF 320 million has already been expended. The resort opens in 2017 and will operate all year round.Elements of the B\u00fcrgenstock Resort have remained open throughout the period of construction.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nAt the beginning of 2002, the parties involved in South Sudan's civil war signed the B\u00fcrgenstock Agreement on the B\u00fcrgenstock.\nIn spring 2004, B\u00fcrgenstock was site to negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots on the issue of accession to the EU.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe 19th century B\u00fcrgenstock Chapel is located in immediate vicinity of the hotels and at the beginning of the cliff path on the B\u00fcrgenstock. It is still owned by the former hotelier family Frey who left their mark on the B\u00fcrgenstock hotels from 1925 to 1997, as well as the non-profit Frey-F\u00fcrst Foundation. The B\u00fcrgenstock Chapel is a replica of the chapel of St. Jost which lies on the slopes of the B\u00fcrgenstock Mountain on the territory of the township of Ennetb\u00fcrgen and is the oldest Gothic sanctuary in the Swiss canton of Nidwaldens. The B\u00fcrgenstock Chapel was built in 1897 under the orders of Countess Tancr\u00e8de de la Baume, n\u00e9e Pozzo di Borgo, who had set up her summer residence in the hotel village on the B\u00fcrgenstock. Among other things, she had an ornate wooden, polychrome Gothic ceiling reproduced in detail in the chapel. Further elements of interior design and decoration are also replicas from the 17th century and are from different churches in Switzerland. The sculpture \"Dance of Death\" by the Swiss sculptor Hans J\u00f6rg Limbach (1928-1990) is located directly next to the chapel. The B\u00fcrgenstock Chapel also became famous because of the wedding of actress Audrey Hepburn with Mel Ferrer in 1954.\nThe rich cultural tradition established in the 19th and 20th centuries on the B\u00fcrgenstock is continued today by several private and independent cultural organisations:\nOn 13 November 2009, the \"B\u00fcrgenstock Kunst- und Kulturstiftung\" (B\u00fcrgenstock Foundation of Art and Culture) - located in Ennetb\u00fcrgen - was founded to preserve historical furniture and antiques from the hotels built in the 19th century on the B\u00fcrgenstock. Around 8000 people visited the special exhibition   honouring the foundation: titled Zukunft hat Herkunft \u2013 Grand Hotellerie von einst und morgen (1870\u20132014) (Provenance with a future \u2013 Grand Hotellerie yesterday and tomorrow), it ran at the Palace Hotel from June to December 2011 and featured exhibits from Switzerland's hospitality legacy. The foundation joined forces with the University of Teacher Education Lucerne to realise an educational trail on the Cliff Path. 1.5 kilometres in length, it was opened on 26 June 2015.The \"Stiftung B\u00fcrgenstock Momente\" (Foundation B\u00fcrgenstock Moments) was created on 11 May 2012 with the aim of implementing cultural events and concerts, also at the historic site of the B\u00fcrgenstock Chapel. Under the direction of Peter Frey \u2013 a descendant of the former hotelier family \u2013 the Stiftung B\u00fcrgenstock Momente has its seat directly in the village of B\u00fcrgenstock and attracts music fans from around the world to the B\u00fcrgenstock, with its yearly week of classical music called \"Carnival of the Stradivari\", amongst others.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains of Switzerland accessible by public transport\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHammetschwand Elevator\nB\u00fcrgenstock Funicular\nGolf Club B\u00fcrgenstock\nB\u00fcrgenstock on Hikr\nFoundation B\u00fcrgenstock Moments\nB\u00fcrgenstock Kunst- und Kulturstiftung\nVilla Honegg\n Media related to B\u00fcrgenstock at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Astrid of Sweden (Astrid Sofia Lovisa Thyra, 17 November 1905 \u2013 29 August 1935) was Queen of the Belgians as the first wife of King Leopold III. By birth she was a princess of Sweden's royal House of Bernadotte.  She was queen for less than two years, dying in a car accident at age 29.  Her only daughter, Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte, later became Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, while both of her sons reigned as King of the Belgians.  Her grandsons include current monarchs King Philippe of Belgium and Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Astrid was also a maternal aunt of King Harald V of Norway. Through her mother Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, she was a paternal second cousin once removed of the future British queen, Elizabeth II.The assassinated children of executed Tsar Nicholas II and their still living cousin, Prince Philip, now  Duke of Edinburgh, were her maternal second cousins.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nPrincess Astrid was born on 17 November 1905, at the Arvfurstens Palats in Stockholm as the third child and youngest daughter of Prince Carl, Duke of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, and his wife, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the third son of Oscar II, King of Sweden and Norway, by his wife, Sophia of Nassau. Her mother was a daughter of King Frederick VIII of Denmark by his wife, Louise of Sweden. Astrid's father was a younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden, and her mother was the younger sister of kings Christian X of Denmark and Haakon VII of Norway.\nAstrid had two elder sisters Margaretha, Princess Axel of Denmark, and M\u00e4rtha, Crown Princess of Norway, and a younger brother Prince Carl Bernadotte (prev. Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland).\nAstrid spent most of her childhood at Arvfurstens Palace in central Stockholm and at the family's summer residence in Fridhem. Astrid was raised in the strict education and without much luxury. Astrid attended the Sint Botvid boarding school, where lessons were taught in French. She then went to Akerstrom-Soderstrom finishing school. She studied sewing, piano, ballet and childcare.\nAs did many princesses of the time, Astrid was encouraged to undertake works of public service in preparation for a life devoted to charitable causes. She worked for a time at a Stockholm orphanage, caring for infants.Astrid enjoyed the outdoors and sports such swimming, skiing, climbing, horseback riding, and golf. She and her sisters were occasionally seen shopping unaccompanied on the streets of Stockholm.\n\n\n== Engagement and wedding ==\n\nAs an eligible princess, Astrid was mentioned as a potential bride for a number of princes including the future Edward VIII of the United Kingdom and the future Olav V of Norway. Astrid's successful suitor was Prince Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant.\nIn September 1926, their engagement was announced. King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium invited the press to the royal palace in Brussels. \"The Queen and I,\" declared Albert, \"would like to announce to you the impending marriage between Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant and the Princess Astrid of Sweden. We are convinced that the princess will bring joy and happiness to our son. Leopold and Astrid have decided to join their lives without any pressures or reasons of state. Theirs is a true union among people with the same inclinations.\" Queen Elisabeth, incorrigible romantic that she was, insisted in saying \"It is a marriage of love... tell it to our people. Nothing was arranged. Not a single political consideration prevailed in our son's decision.\"\n\nIn Stockholm on 4 November 1926 civilly and in Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, Brussels on 10 November religiously, Princess Astrid married Prince Leopold. The couple travelled separately to Antwerp after their civil marriage, to be reunited in Belgium.\nFor the religious marriage, the couple were attended by a large wedding party of young friends and relatives: Princess Feodora of Denmark, Princess Marie-Jos\u00e9 of Belgium, Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden, Princess Ingrid of Sweden, Alfhild Ekelund, Prince Carl of Sweden, Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden, Crown Prince Olav of Norway, Margareta St\u00e4hl, Count Claes Sparre, Anna Adelsw\u00e4rd, Prince Charles of Belgium, Count Folke Bernadotte, Baron Sigvard Beck-Friis, Anne Marie von Essen, and Baron Carl Str\u00f6mfelt.Princess Astrid was given a tiara as a wedding gift from the Belgian government, created by Belgian jeweler Van Bever, the original version of the diadem is a flexible diamond bandeau in a stylized Greek key motif topped with 11 large diamonds on spikes. These large stones, totaling around 100 carats on their own, symbolize the nine provinces of Belgium and the (now former) Belgian colony of the Congo. She later added a set of diamond arches to enclose each of the 11 independent stones. After Astrid's death the tiara was in the possession of King Leopold, and his second wife Lilian, Princess of R\u00e9thy wore parts of the tiara but not the full gem (Lilian never held the title of Queen). Leopold abdicated the throne in favor of his son Baudouin; when Baudouin married, Leopold gave the tiara to the new queen. Fabiola, Belgium's first queen since Astrid, wore it on her wedding day. She handed the jewel over after Baudouin's death to be worn by Queen Paola who, after the abdication of her husband Albert, gave it to Mathilde new Queen of the Belgians.\n\n\n== Married life ==\n\nAstrid and her husband spent their honeymoon in south of France before moving into a wing of the Royal Palace in Brussels. After the honeymoon period, Astrid began studying French and Dutch.Astrid was enthusiastically adopted by the Belgians. She was widely loved for her beauty, charm and simplicity. Her public and official engagements radiated enthusiasm. As Duchess of Brabant, she worked tirelessly to alleviate various forms of adversity. Leopold was her most fervent admirer. The love shared by the young couple was evident to all. On more than one occasion people could see them holding hands, even during official engagements.\nIn October 1927, Leopold and Astrid had a daughter, Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte, who later married Jean of Luxembourg in April 1953 and became Grand Duchess consort of Luxembourg in November 1964. One year later, she and her husband visited the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).In 1930, the Belgian press gave extensive coverage to the birth of the long-awaited royal heir. Leopold was on his way to visit some areas away from Brussels when the Duchess of Brabant went into labor. The royal palace immediately sent him a telegram that reached Leopold at a stop during his journey. The royal palace's message announced the impending birth of the couple's second child. Without thinking twice about the day's engagements, Leopold returned to Brussels immediately. Prince Leopold and King Albert I walked anxiously in the garden at Stuyvenberg Castle while the Duchess of Brabant began her labor. Next to Astrid were her mother, the Duchess of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, and her mother-in-law, the Queen. At 4:15 pm the royal physicians proudly announced the healthy birth of a little prince. The sound of a cannon silenced the general happiness expressed by the people of Brussels. Their first son, Baudouin eventually succeeded his father as King of the Belgians. He was given the name of Baudouin in memory of his deceased granduncle who was supposed to have become king.\nAt Stuyvenberg, not far away from the Royal Castle of Laeken, the young Duchess of Brabant, raised in the simplicity of the Scandinavian courts, joyfully raised her growing family. At a small villa in the palace grounds, Astrid cooked for her family. And every time she could, Astrid would stroll along the Avenue Louise with her children. The Court Marshall vehemently protested against these promenades. \"They break protocol,\" he would say. Yet in her simplicity, Astrid would retort by saying \"But I'm just another mother, am I not?\" She even went as far as joining the crowds during a military revenue in an effort to see her promenading husband at the head of his regiment.\n\n\n== Conversion to Catholicism ==\nRaised as a Lutheran, Astrid converted to Catholicism after marrying Leopold. She had initially considered converting to Catholicism, simply because it was the religion of Belgium, but the priest she consulted, Father William Hemmick,  told her not to do so until she genuinely believed it was the true religion.\nAstrid learned more about Catholicism and, several years later, in 1930, converted from genuine conviction. Her decision made her happy, and she confided to a close childhood friend: \"My soul has found peace.\" Her father-in-law, King Albert I, who was very devout himself, repeated, on the day of Astrid's conversion: \"I am glad, very glad. Now all the family is united in the same religion.\"\n\n\n== Queen ==\n\nOn 17 February 1934, King Albert I died in a mountain-climbing accident in Marche-les-Dames, Belgium. Leopold and Astrid became the new King and Queen of the Belgians with the style of Majesty.  Later that year, the third child of Leopold and Astrid was born. He was named Albert after his grandfather, and would eventually succeed his brother Baudouin as King of the Belgians.\nAs queen, Astrid dedicated her time to raising her family and promoting social causes which brought her into contact with the Belgians. She was very concerned with the situation of women, children, and disadvantaged people. During an economic crisis in Belgium in 1935, she organized a collection of clothing, money and food for the poor. She did this through an open letter, which was published as the \"Queen\u2019s Appeal\". Queen Astrid also visited many poor settlements in Belgium.\nIn May 1935, Queen Astrid patronized Milk Week, an effort to encourage Belgians to drink healthy beverages. She took this opportunity to charge Gatien du Parc, one of her courtiers, with the task of preparing a detailed report on milk regulations in foreign countries.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nIn August 1935, the King and Queen went incognito to Switzerland on holiday. Prince Albert remained in Brussels. Only one year old, he was considered too young for the journey. Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte and Baudouin had travelled with their parents to their holiday home, Villa Haslihorn in Horw, Switzerland. The children were sent back to Belgium with their nannies on 28 August.\nOn 29 August 1935, the King and Queen decided to go for a last hike in the mountains before returning home. Their chauffeur was sitting in the back of the Packard One-Twenty convertible, the King was driving and the Queen looking at a map. As the Queen pointed out something to her husband the car went off the road, down a steep slope, and slammed into a pear tree. Queen Astrid had opened her door to try to get out, but she was thrown out upon impact. Her body collided with the trunk of the tree, while the car slammed into a second tree.  King Leopold was thrown out of the car as well, but he was only lightly injured. The car went on, only to stop in a lake. It was 9:30 am on 29 August 1935. The Queen died from her injuries at the scene of the accident at K\u00fcssnacht am Rigi, near Lake Lucerne, Schwyz, Switzerland.\nQueen Astrid is interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken, Brussels, beside her husband, King Leopold III of the Belgians, and his second wife, Lilian, Princess of R\u00e9thy.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe queen was deeply mourned by her husband, King Leopold, by the Belgians, and by the Swedes. In 1935, the Belgian postal authorities  issued a postage stamp showing her portrait outlined in black, known as the Astrid Mourning issue.  Later that same year, it released a series of  anti-tuberculosis fund stamps with the same design.A commemorative chapel was built in Switzerland at the site of the crash. The chapel has become a destination for Swedish and Belgian tourists. A museum nearby holds images and memorabilia of the event, including a shard from the windscreen and the log of the pear tree. The tree itself was felled by a storm in 1992. The car was sunk at a deep part of the Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee at the request of the king.As of May 2020, two of her grandchildren are reigning monarchs; King Philippe of Belgium and Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. She was also a maternal aunt of King Harald V of Norway. Four of her female descendants have been named Astrid to honour her, her granddaughters Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria, Princess Astrid of Belgium, her great-granddaughter Princess Marie-Astrid of Liechtenstein, and her great-great-granddaughter Archduchess Anna Astrid of Austria-Este. Her niece Princess Astrid of Norway (later Mrs. Ferner) was named to honour her.\nAstrid Avenue in Bogor Botanical Garden in Indonesia (formerly Dutch East Indies) was named after her when she was honeymooning there with her spouse in 1928, the avenue is decorated with spectacular display of canna lilies of various colors.The popular Swedish layer cake Princess cake was named after Astrid and her two sisters when they were children.\n\n\n== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==\n\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n17 November 1905 \u2013 4 November 1926: Her Royal Highness Princess Astrid of Sweden\n4 November 1926 \u2013 17 February 1934: Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Brabant\n17 February 1934 \u2013 29 August 1935: Her Majesty The Queen of the Belgians\n\n\n=== Honours ===\n Sovereign Military Order of Malta: Bailiff Dame Grand Cross of Obedience of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\n\n=== Arms ===\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCatherine Barjansky. \"Portraits with Backgrounds.\"\nArt Beeche. \"The Snow Princess.\"\nRobert Capelle. \"Dix-huit ans aupr\u00e8s du Roi L\u00e9opold.\"\nCharles d'Ydewalle. \"Albert and the Belgians: Portrait of a King.\"\nEvelyn Graham. \"Albert King of the Belgians.\"\nLuciano Regolo. \"La Regina Incompresa.\"\nLars Rooth. \"More Joy Than Pain.\"\nAnna Sparre. \"Astrid mon amie.\"\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoyal Love Match (1926), newsreel on the British Path\u00e9 YouTube Channel\nTragic Death of the Queen of the Belgians (1935), newsreel on the British Path\u00e9 YouTube Channel\nAstrid's Conversion to Catholicism\nThe Queen's Charity Drive, 1935\nPortraits of the Nation: Postage Stamps and National Identity\nThe making of a Belgicist reference to Villa Haslihorn\nPackard Club images from the Packard car after the accident\nBELGIUM: Death of Astrid Time article\nNewspaper clippings about  Astrid of Sweden in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBW",

        "wiki": "Titlis is a mountain of the Uri Alps, located on the border between the cantons of Obwalden and Bern. At 3,238 metres (10,623 ft) above sea level, it is the highest summit of the range north of the Susten Pass, between the Bernese Oberland and Central Switzerland. It is mainly accessed from Engelberg (OW) on the north side and is famous as the site of the world's first rotating cable car. The cable car system connects Engelberg (996 m (3,268 ft)) to the summit of Klein Titlis (3,028 m (9,934 ft)) through the three stages of Gerschnialp (1,262 m (4,140 ft)), Tr\u00fcbsee (1,796 m (5,892 ft)) and Stand (2,428 m (7,966 ft)).\nThe last part of cable car leads above the glacier. At Klein Titlis, it is possible to visit an illuminated glacier cave from an entrance within the cable-car station, which also includes shops and restaurants. The Titlis Cliff Walk, the highest elevation suspension bridge in Europe, opened in December 2012, giving views across the Alps. Many people use Titlis as a cheaper and easier option than Jungfraujoch.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTitlis straddles the border between Obwalden and Bern. The main summit of Titlis (sometimes distinguished by the name Gross Titlis) and Klein Titlis are both located between the municipalities of Engelberg on the north and Gadmen on the south. The Titlis massif is also partially located in Nidwalden, where the highest point of that canton is found: the Rotst\u00f6ckli (2,901 m). Titlis itself is the highest point in Obwalden and in the valley of Engelberg. East of Titlis is the Grassen, where the borders between the cantons of Obwalden, Berne and Uri converge. The geographical center of Switzerland is situated about 15 kilometers west of the mountain.\nTitlis is the highest mountain in the portion of the Uri Alps north of the Susten Pass. This part of the range is located between the valleys of the Hasli (west) and the Reuss (east), thus separating the waters feeding the basins of the Aare and Reuss respectively. On the north side, the valley of Engelberg (Engelbergertal) is drained by the Engelberger Aa, a tributary of the Lake Lucerne. The valley is located southwards from Lake Lucerne.\nThe northern side of the massif is covered by the Titlis Glacier (German: Titlisgletscher). Due to the global warming the glacier has been receded dramatically; it is expected to disappear in about twenty years. The south steep and rocky face rises above the Wenden Glacier. The east side overlooks a glacier named Firnalpeligletscher.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn earlier times, Titlis was known under the names Wendenstock or Nollen. The Reissend Nollen and the Wendenst\u00f6cke are the nearest western neighbours to the mountain, slightly lower than Titlis, but with sharp rugged peaks. In a document of 1435 the mountain is called Tuttelsberg (Tutilos mountain), referencing to a man named Tutilos, who was probably a local farmer. The name, from Tutilos Berg, became Titlisberg and later Titlis.The first ascent of Titlis was probably made in the year 1739. It was done by Ignaz Hess, J. E. Waser and two other men from Engelberg. The first written evidence of an ascent is found in the Engelberger Dokumente. They mention a party of four men that reached the summit in 1744.On 21 January 1904 the first ski ascent of Titlis was made by Joseph Kuster and Willi Amrhein.In March 1967 the cable car to Klein Titlis (3,032 m) was inaugurated.\nIn December 2012, the Titlis Cliff Walk opened to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the Engelberg-Gerschnialp cableway.\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\nKlein Titlis hosts a significant telecommunications site, used for high capacity point-to-point microwave radio links and VHF/UHF repeaters. Licensed band radio links are regulated by the Swiss Federal Office of Communications.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nThe summit of Titlis is located above the snow line, thus it has a cold, snowy climate with permanent snow cover and freezing temperatures.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains of Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSwisstopo maps\n\n\n== External links ==\nTitlis webpage on the Swiss national tourist office\nTitlis Tourism homepage",

          "Mount titlis is a famous tourist attraction. We went up first by two seater trolley and then by a big round trolley. While on the two seater trolley we heard cow bells and we saw many cow farms below.",
          "Went I went there the weather was not very good (lots of clouds and wind). My interest was to do ski, but the conditions were not good and the resort is quite small. A resort for a day trip from Zurich",
          "We went in November, it was -10 but it was all worth it. All the activities were not on due to the weather however it was still so beautiful. I would love to go when its sunny and we can enjoy the views more. wrap up warm if you go in Winter its very cold!",
          "We went to Engelberg/Titlis because forecast showed that it had one of the best snow in Europe by feb/march. It was ok. One gondola takes you up the mountain and there aren\u2019t many slopes/lifts. Good off piste and good mountain food though.",
          "As it was too windy when I get onto the mountain, I cannot experience the ice flyer, but the whole experience was amazing, very cold and very windy. Got some stunning picture at the cliff bridge!",
          "It goes up to around 3200m and if the weather is good offers superb view of the distant mountains. Also on the way down stop off and in spring/summer check out the lake and have a bite to eat on the terrace of the lift station",

          "The tram to the top was unique, it revolved as it ascended. It was a rather rapid trip up to 10,000' and I had a bit of altitude dizziness. But after a little rest, I was ok. Bueatiful views!!",
          "Due to landing in Zurich on a clear sunny day we decided to visit Mt Titlis on the way to our accommodation in Lauterbrunnen. It was expensive, but the views were amazing once at the top. We stayed at the top for about 4-5 hours (2 adults, 11 and 8 year old) admiring the views,",
          "We took the train from Zurich via Lucerne to Engelberg. Then up to 10,000 feet with the gondolas. No problems whatsoever, you really don\u2019t need to pay extra money and spend extra hours going with some tourbuses. The view from 3000 mtrs is just amazong. Before you go, please",
          "My partner and I visited Titlis a few weeks ago, and I have to say it was worth the money. I know it seems pricey (everything here is) but if you have never been to the summit of a high mountain before its breathtaking. The views are incredible. Personally I am scared to death",

          "Everything about the mountain, lift system, facilities, preparation of pistes and availability of off piste for all levels is brilliant. Shame no recent snowfall when we went but we could hardly make that their fault!",

          "Very poor ski slope maintenance. Most ski resorts will groom their slopes overnight - not here! Many slopes are closed despite a fantastic snowfall the day before. If there is no snowfall within a week, most of the pistes shut down as there is a lack of snow cannons apart from",

          "We went to Jungfraujoch one day and Mt Titlis the next. They were both great experiences but if I were picking one to go to, Mt Titlis would for sure be it. There is more to do, so much beautiful scenery! It was the highlight of our time in Switzerland",
          "If you want to experience cool weather up in the mountains while in Zurich, this is a day\u2019s tour with The Best of Switzerland Tours. The mountain top can be crowded with passable food that will fill a hungry stomach. The lift is easy to access the the revolving tram will give",

          "First you go up in a small cable car and then change onto the rotating one, which is really cool and gives you great views of the glacier. At the top you can walk on the suspension bridge, play in the snow and ride on the Ice Flyer chairlift over the glacier: all really fun.",

          "The cable car ride to the middle station was a great chance to look at the surrounding vistas of vast farmlands and the snow-capped mountains in the backdrop. From the middle station, we rode the rotating cable car up to the summit - it was a short, but fun ride nonetheless.",
          "We visited Mount Titlis in Engelberg and enjoyed the top through the cable car and the lake as well. The price of cable car ticket is expensive and we could not enjoy the bridge or ice flyer because of tender storm that day. It should not be missed if you nearby Engelberg.",

          "Have been traveling Europe for around a month now and this was the highlight of the trip. It really is an unreal experience from start to finish. The day started overcast so we tried to time it right so we could reach the peak to get clear skies (12.30-3). Saying that,",
          "We have gone to Engelberg several times and it hasn\u2019t failed us for Easter skiing due to the glacier. It is not very well known in England. The only downside is the tourists that come on their tours around Europe & stand in huddles in the car park taking selfies & getting in the",
          "We did both Tiflis and Jungfraujoch and trust me you should too. We had the pleasure of visiting titlis when it was raining so we experienced the icy temperatures and the ice flyer is a must. Its amazing realllllly beautiful - don\u2019t miss it. Do it with your family. Its for all",

          "Amazing but please make sure you wear warm clothes and take with you extra clothes if you will play games because you will get wet. The restaurant closes at 5 so grab a good bite before",
          "It's one of the most amazing places to visit. Don't hesitate to spend for the amazing extra ride which will take you to a glacier and the top where you can take a lot of pictures",
          "It was worth visiting. Lot of activities to do. Better to be early for full day fun. The snow slides are not as good as Joungfrauch. Waiting time for the cable car was way too long.",

          "Amazing breathtaking view, it's something your eyes can never forget. The serene and calm nature, with harsh reality of isolation. As far as you can see it's ice capped mountains, away from a noisy city, they hav their own world.",
          "Too beautiful and there r so many types of cable cars lot of fun",
          "The best time to visit this place is in early summer, there is least likely to encounter abrupt weather disturbance or storm. Slope sledding is so fun to both young and adults. If you are in Lucerne, Switzerland, never miss this beautiful scenic getaway!",
          "Worth the effort. Facilities at the top are great. The ice tunnel could use some work. It's cool but I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at, also, it would be nice to put some big yellow arrows up to keep the flow of tourists running in a single direction.",
          "Over crowded with people from my own country.. Very unorganized transport to go up.. crampped all pushing their way in the cable cars. There are much better places to visit with good views and snow.. Would recommend definitely not..",
          "A must go for those who are not afraid of height! Love the cable car ride up as well as the first rotating cable car (rotair). Once up there, there are so much that can be done. You can spend hours of photo taking and activities.",
          "Wonderful experience at the top . U can eat ice cream at -10degree. Old age person can enjoy the ice. If it\u2019s bright sunny day then can have a great experience.",
          "MT. Titlis is a must see place in summer time. This is the only place you get to see snow in Swiss in summer. Few activities to enjoy and a chocolate store up there. The restaurant is very expensive.",
          "Just a wow place nothing less. Must visit particularly for nature and the mountain and snow lovers. It's place to play to play on ice or enjoy astonishing beauty of it or trake on glacier. Undescribable beauty",
          "Very beautiful and photogenic mountain... Access to the top is through cable cars... The quality of the cable cars is very good.. Not many vibrations...\nThe last cable car returning back from the peak is at 6 pm",

          "Lovely spot. Worth the trip and good experience with cable car,  ice flyers & cliff walk in the bridge. And when in the top and sky clear have a good view of glacier",
          "Good for Mountainbiking. Nice view. Skiing is also fine",
          "Ice flyer is a simple chairlift and requires extra price for the usage, the panorama is nice but nothing special compared to other Swiss summits... The glacier cave is a nice one!",
          "If you get a superb clear day, you definitely in for a treat... Astounding views on views as far as you can see mountain and mountains upon mountains. A jaw dropping experience and was 16c up top Titlis. They have a Swiss watch store 10,000 \u2026",
          "Great place to spend a day. Nice facilities. Indian food available. Great photo ops.",
          "Total enjoyable place to be in. Take a cable car to the top feel the cold enjoy the snow and go back with memories what can be better than that.\nWe could reach only to 10000 ft height because of heavy snow fall we could not process to upper \u2026",
          "Best snow experience if you are from one of tropical countries together with amazing cable car ride to the top of the mountain. One of the best experience I had in my life. You can find snow in Mouth Titlis all around the year.",
          "This is a must visit if you are anywhere close to it. The experience is mind blowing with the ice cave, glacier walk, panorama lounge , rides , tubing.. this has everything to engage people of all ages. This is the best way to live the hype \u2026",

          "Amazing connectivity...but horrible rush. The place is full of thousands of Indian and Chinese tourists. Around 12000 Chinese tourists visited in this last week. Preferably to be visited in peak summer if you want to see the glory of Swiss Alps. Highly reduced visibility in May.",
          "Loved it. However authority should do proper crowd control. Also they must provide warm clothes on rent.",
          "It\u2019s way overcrowded and to think we came during off peak tourist season. But the views are really great. So if u don\u2019t mind squeezing and waiting for awhile. Do visit!",
          "Good place in swiss Alps. There is a rotating cable car. Glacier cave, cliff bridge and ice flyer. Take ice flyer, they have many ice games down there. Visit in afternoon. There are many tour buses in morning.",
          "Lovely trip up to the top on the two tiered cable - one normal and the other rotating. Fascinating glacier, ice caves, restaurants. Worth every moment of the trip. Surprisingly even a cardboard cutoff of Shahrukh Khan and Kajol from \"Dilwale dulhaniya lejayen\" on the terrace.",
          "good place. In this photo i m inside of Ice aquarium.",
          "So many tourist we don't feel comfortable when we come in summer. They should open express line, it is very uncomfortable queing with people who aren't have manner who likes cutting the line. \nWhen i went up, there are lots of people sat down on the floor, trash everywhere. Titlis is more enjoyable to see when autumn or winter.",

          "Great place to be with many activities and good food (quite decent if you use theme parks as reference). Directions and upfront info on certain area closure should be informed earlier when we purchase ticket at the counter. Felt cheated when cliff walk is closed despite we bought the tickets for that",

        "wiki": "Pilatus, also often referred to as Mount Pilatus, is a mountain massif overlooking Lucerne in Central Switzerland. It is composed of several peaks, of which the highest (2,128.5 m (6,983 ft)) is named Tomlishorn.\n\n\n== Geography and transport ==\n\nThe whole mountain range stretches at least from the Lopper just opposite from Stansstad to the east as far as at least to the Mittagg\u00fcpfi (1,917 m [6,289 ft]) and the Risetestock (1,759 m [5,771 ft]) to the west on the border between LU and OW.\nThe highest peak, Tomlishorn (2,128.5 m [6,983 ft]), and the other peaks, such as Widderfeld (2,076 m [6,811 ft]) even further west than the Tomlishorn on the border between LU and OW, Matthorn (2,040 m [6,690 ft]) to the south, the Klimsenhorn (1,906 m [6,253 ft]) to the north (UW), and Rosegg (1,974 m [6,476 ft]) and Windegg (1,673 m [5,489 ft]) to the east, both on the border of UW and OW, should only be approached with appropriate Alpine hiking equipment.\nJurisdiction over the massif is divided between the cantons of Obwalden (OW), Nidwalden (NW), and Lucerne (LU). The main peaks are right on the border between Obwalden and Nidwalden.\nThe top can be reached with the Pilatus Railway, the world's steepest cogwheel railway, from Alpnachstad, operating from May to November (depending on snow conditions) and the whole year with the aerial panorama gondolas and aerial cableways from Kriens. Tomlishorn is located about 1.3 km (0.81 mi) to the southeast of the top cable car and cog railway station. Two other peaks, closer to the stations are called Esel (Donkey, 2,118 m [6,949 ft]), which lies just east over the railway station, the one on the west side is called Oberhaupt (Head-Leader, 2,105 m [6,906 ft]). \nDuring the summer, the \"Golden Round Trip\" \u2014 a popular route for tourists \u2014 involves taking a boat from Lucerne across Lake Lucerne to Alpnachstad, going up on the cogwheel railway, coming down on the aerial cableways and panorama gondolas, and taking a bus back to Lucerne.\nThe cable car at Kriens can be reached by the Number 1 bus that leaves from Lucerne central train station. It is then a short 10 minute walk to the cable car, following the Pilatus signs.\n\n\n== History ==\nA few different local legends about the origin of the name exist. One claims that Pilatus was named so because Pontius Pilate was buried there. However, a similar legend is told of Monte Vettore in Italy. Another is that the mountain looks like the belly of a large man, Pilate, lying on his back and was thus named for him. The name may also be derived from \"pileatus,\" meaning \"cloud-topped.\"\nA medieval legend had dragons with healing powers living on the mountain. A chronicle from 1619 reads: 'as I was contemplating the serene sky by night, I saw a very bright dragon with flapping wings go from a cave in a great rock in the mount called Pilatus toward another cave, known as Flue, on the opposite side of the lake'. This legend was the inspiration for Steven Reineke's famous concert band piece, Pilatus: Mountain of Dragons.Numbered amongst those who have reached its summit are Conrad Gessner, Theodore Roosevelt, Arthur Schopenhauer (1804),  Queen Victoria and Julia Ward Howe (1867).\nThe mountain has fortified radar (part of the Swiss FLORAKO system) and weather stations on the Oberhaupt summit, not open to the public view and used all year round.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Weather ==\n\n\n== In literature ==\nIn The Chalet School Does It Again. (1955) Elinor Brent-Dyer retells the Pilate burial place legend.\nMount Pilatus plays a pivotal role in the conclusion of Brad Thor's fiction novel Lions of Lucerne.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains of Switzerland\nList of most isolated mountains of Switzerland\nList of mountains of Switzerland accessible by public transport\nList of mountains of Switzerland named after people\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.pilatus.ch",

          "Fantastic place, well maintained and serviced. Breathtaking views. Lots of parking which is quite cheep. Cart rides themselves are expensive, 140 EUR return trip for two. But still worth it. And afterwards I recommend visiting town of Lucerne, so beautiful, and you can admire",

          "For the same price, one can go to the top and back by cable car or cog railway. We went up by cable car and back down by cog railway, which wasn't very exciting unless you have a thing for bumpy noisy train rides. But in any case, go!",
          "This was a good excursion, but not the one that I rave about to family and friends. It is a very touristy location, but the views are obviously pretty. If I went back to Switzerland, I wouldn't bother with this one again, but it was worth it for a first time experience. If you",
          "One is the core reasons for our trip was to experience the mountains. This experience did not disappoint. We followed guidance and \u201cwent backwards\u201d on the trip. Gondola first, cog wheel / boat ride last. 100% right. Avoided the crowds just as described.",

Currency rates might change.There",

          "Our visit to Mt. Pilatus was part of an all day excursion. We took a boat from Lucerne to Alpnachstad where we boarded a cogwheel train that was opened using steam traction on 4 June 1889, and later electrified on in 1937. The ride takes about 30 minutes and the views are",

          "This was a fun trip, as you get to climb the mountain in the world's steepest cogwheel tram! The views, when you reach the top, are amazing! So well worth the trip! Also, the trip is free with the Swiss Rail Pass! We traveled from Lucerne, so we got to take a lovely boat ride",
          "A fantastic day trip not to be missed, absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. We went up in the worlds steepest cog railway and down by the cable car, both which I highly recommend. There is lots to do on the mountain, plenty of pictures to be taken, food is very expensive as is",
          "This was the highlight of our trip. Starts with an 1 1/3 hr boat ride, then ride to the top of Mt Pilatus on a cogwheel train which takes about 1/2 hr. At the top you are treated to magnificent views of the Alps, be prepared to slush through some snow and dress accordingly. The",

          "Great place to visit for families with kids, I would say up to age 13. They had excellent rope course, did the glider through forest. Tobbagganing was fun with beautiful views! Kids loved it here and had a great time! The views alone are worth the trip.",
          "We took a boat to the cog railway going up to the top of Mt Pilatus. Coming down was by gondola and then another lift. Commercial bus back to town. VERY CHILLY on top of the mountain. Nice restaurant for lunch.",

          "This was such a fun trip from Lucerne. It was just a quick drive with easy parking, too. The ride up and back was as much a wonderful part of the experience as being as the top was. We absolutely loved this trip. The views were outstanding. Make sure you dress accordingly,",
          "Absolutely amazing tour, starting with the cable car up the mountain, the views from the top, the cog wheel train ride down and the boat ride back to Lucerne. We were fortunate to have a beautiful sunny day so the views were amazing. Yolanda was a great tour guide. Highly",
          "We took the earliest cog railway train (Pilatus Bahn) to the top of Mt Pilatus on a sunny June day. The view was incredible! The walkway and restaurant on to of the mountain were an engineering marvel. The top was accessible by either cable car or cog railway. We did return trip",

          "What a fantastic day. Did the whole route, boat from Lucerne, cog wheel train up then Gondola down. All very easy logistically. Buy tickets from the booth right at the lakefront. Nice relaxing boat ride across the lake (it makes 2-3 stops so get off on the last stop!) Train is",
          "Great experience! Took my family ages range from 68 to 8 years old. We all had a wonderful time. We really enjoyed the stop with all the activities right before the peak of the mountain.",
          "An absolute highlight of my trip. This is something that needs to be done on a clear, fog-less day. I'm sure it would still be a great view with fog but I don't think the view would be as spectacular as we got on a nice clear day. The view is just something else, you could",

          "Excellent views of the Swiss Alps, Lucerne, and surrounding area. Visit was combined with a lake cruise. Very worthwhile.",
          "The ride with cable took us maybe 30 minutes and on the top the views are stunning. The only thing I regret - that I didn't hike it up. I saw many hikers from my cable car and it looked amazing. It's quite steep in the end, but I am sure - worth it. Now on the top you are going",

          "Against every instinct for self preservation we boarded the cogwheel train for the 40-minute ride to the top. Grades exceeding 48 degrees. Sheer drop offs of thousands of feet left and right. You can\u2019t hold your breath for 40 minutes. You might be able to close your eyes for",

          "If you visit Lucerne, you should absolutely take a side trip to Mount Pilatus! From the heart of Lucerne it is a quick and easy bus ride to the base of the mountain and the trams that take you up the hill. The scenic views are incredible all the way around. They have cafes and",
          "This experience was so much fun! The funicular reaching the summit is a lesson in the marvel of Swiss engineering. And to have some cultural based musical entertainment at the summit was the cream on top of the cake. View is excellent but you must be patient with the clouds",
          "My experience on Mt . Pilates was delightful. The ride both to the top and the return trip were efficient and fun. The hikes at the top ,although short were not what I would consider easy, but that\u2019s what they advertise. I am in good shape , so it was not a problem.",

          "We took a tour that took us by gondola and cable car to the summit of Mt. Pilatus where you can enjoy the views, do a hike, have a snack, and if you're lucky, also enjoy some yodeling. We then came back down in the steepest cogwheel train. Great experience!",
          "This was our 1st 'adventure' once we arrived in Switzerland in the middle of winter (Jan)!! 7000 feet up. We paid abt $120 for 2 tickets that we bought from the hotel we stayed @. It was a beautiful scenic car ride to Pilatus & we happily got on the gondola - just the 2 of us.",
          "We caught the bus in Luzern and took it to Pilatus. Then we boarded the tram. The views were spectacular. We enjoyed the self guided tour, as we could stay as long as we wanted. There are 4 or 5 trails to walk, once you are at the top. Restaurant is there. That is about $20.00",

          "We chose the cogwheel train from Alpnach to ascend Mt. Pilatus because we found there were lots of gondola options on other mountains and the cogwheel train seemed unique. It was! The negatives: - They don't let people pre-book and purchase tickets. So when we arrived, we had",
          "We did the golden round trip, in reverse (bus, gondola lifts, looked around the top, cogwheel railway, steamboat). We enjoyed the trip lots, and found that it was for the most part quite quiet doing the trip in reverse. The views from the top were beautiful, and we had a",
          "We took a day trip to Mount Pilatus on a clear day, and it was amazing! Boat from Lucerne to Alpnachstad was beautiful. Note that in Alpnachstad you need to exchange your ticket. We bought our Golden Circle tickets at our hotel and didn\u2019t know. We went to the bathroom and missed",
          "A great day spent riding the various modes of transportation and marveling over the gorgeous views. For an extra fee (3 euros) you can ride the toboggan down and be pulled back up (backwards) to the starting line. No cameras/phones allowed to be used unless you have a GoPro",
          "Very easy to get to. Book your tickets st the station and kids get a great deal. Catch a boat from pier 2, about an hour to get to Alpanstaad, take the cog wheel train up, enjoy the amazing views at Mt Pilatus, take the cable car down, and bus it back to Luzern from Krien!",
          "Nice experience riding a cog train up to the top of the mountain. Lovely sights along the way and a serenade by the cow bells along the way. Once at the top you can paraglide, hike on trails, stay at the hotel or fine in the restaurant. Take the gondola and \u201cegg\u201d down the other",
          "We also did Jungfraujoch but this was truly an awesome journey as well. Make sure your Swiss Pass is valid (costly mistake on my part - it had run out the night before). Less cold weather too! We did the Golden Round Trip, starting with the boat ride from Lucerne (pick a",

It\u2019s very stip. it goes through cloud to the top of the mountain. There is some farms and cows on the way up. You can see lot of other mountains",
          "Other ham riding up a cog wheel train and back down a cable car there\u2019s really nothing on Pilatus. It\u2019s an okay view but unless you have a travel pass which affords the trip free of charge I wouldn\u2019t bother. Tell pass also includes free transport to Pilatus.",
          "Loved the train ride up Mount Pilatus with family! The journey was around 15-20 minutes from the Lucerne station.",
          "First you take the gondola approximately 80 percentile of the way up the mountain and the views are just incredible. The final ascend is via the dragon air tram which is the best part and will make you gasp. I despise heights and did fine. Everything is very smooth and the views",
          "A must do excursion. The entire experience is a thrill. Strongly recommend you get a ticket that includes everything. Firstly there is the 4 seater chairlift to the entrance of the mountain, then a larger cable car to the summit. There are plenty of nice walks and views to",
          "We used public transportation to get here, very easy. We rode the cogwheel train up the mountain (beautiful views along the way) and took the cable car down the other side. We spent some time on top on the various viewpoints, and took lots of photos. Definitely worth the",
          "Although the name of the mountain is really \"biblically\" strange, it is a must to go there. Public transportation is so good in Switzerland that you are there easily. We enjoyed the view so much! I can't say how it could be with cold weather. In August was 30 degrees.",
          "We had perfect weather on the day of our visit. Breathtakingly gorgeous scenery. Blue sky, lake, and the Alps - quintessentially Swiss! Highly recommend taking the cable up and the train down (or the other way round).",
          "WE took the Golden round trip to Mt Pilatus from Lucerne on July 19th' 2019. The trip to the top of Mt. Pilatus was good. However, unimaginable happened to us on our way back down. WE entered the air gondola , however it was full, and we couldn't find a space to stand",
          "Mt. Pilatus was shrouded in clouds so we couldn't see anything. However, the cogwheel train ride to the top was fun and we saw lots of cows and beautiful scenery on the way up. On the way down, we took the aerial tram and stopped to ride the toboggan. That was a lot of fun! We",
          "We spent the afternoon visiting Mt. Pilatus and it has been the highlight of our trip to Lucern. Interesting cog rail up, then gondolas down gave us great views of different sides of the mountain. But the hikes around the mountain top gave us even more amazing views. We had",
          "We took the cogwheel up. It was just gorgeous!! A little difficult for ppl with fear of heights, but so worth it!! We did the Dragon walk (easy and beautiful) We took the cable car down one stop, and did the Alpine slide, which was tons of fun! We went down one more stop to",
          "We took the lifts and gondola up, the funicular car down and then returned to Luzern by boat. Spectacular views all around. Spent a few hours at the top doing a couple of hikes to overlook points and taking pictures. Had some lunch up there as well, food was more reasonably",
          "Well worth the price to see the stunning views. The little train goes up the mountain at a 48% grade. Really a fun ride!",
          "We enjoyed this beautiful trip! The weather was partly cloudy and so the crowds weren't too large. We rode the boat from Lucerne to the cog train and then cable car to Kriens and bus back to Lucerne.",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our adventure on the cogwheel train up Mount Pilatus. The view at the top was phenomenal. We were serenaded by some music outside while we enjoyed the sunny day after lunch in June. The gondola ride down the mountain provided a different adventure. Great",
          "We travelled from Zurich to Lucerne on a day trip and decided to visit My Pilatus. What a terrible mistake. We asked about this trip at the tourist information office at the railway station and were sold tickets at 36 sf each ( with our Swiss passes). We were told that trip",
          "The mountain has a perfect position! You can see the plains of lucern all the way to zurich, the mountain range to interlaken and many snowy peaks. Also the pilatus train is fun to ride.",
          "We went in march of 2019, and although the cogwheel train was not operating (we knew this beforehand by looking up the schedule) the cable cars were great! We took the public tram from the center of Lucerne to the Pilatus stop. Pretty easy to navigate but may be a little tricky",
          "Mount Pilatus is legendary and unpredictable. and with a visit if the weather is suitable. Dominating the skyline from the city, the mountain is iconic. When cloud surrounds the top of the mountain, there will be no views to awe one, so the purpose of the ascent is nil. Shrouded",
          "We had an excellent day to Mt Pilatus! We had already been to Mt Rigi, however Pilatus was different and well worth visiting! We took a gondola ride to Frukmuntegg, changed to a larger cable car to the summit where we sat in the cafe watching the views. Breathtaking! Too rainy",
          "Amazing views. Take the cog train up. It's a once in a lifetime trip. Food up at top isn't bad at all...",
          "While the girls took the amazing cogwheel train up enjoying the breathtaking views the boys ran up and meet us at the top. What and amazing panarama, just like a movie honestly! We did the loop trail at the top and got even more spectacular views and enjoyed a wonderful Lunch at",

          "The train to the base of Pilatus is covered by the swiss travel pass, but the cog wheel train and gondola are not (but you get a discount). Both up and down are great rides in themselves, and there is some super hiking at the top (the flower trail is the best), and half way",
          "What a perfect experience! We enjoyed every moment in our visit in the cable-car / cogwheel. The view up on the mountain is breathtaking! must give it a try.",
          "The incredible pictures you see of the Mount Pilatus experience are exactly what you're getting. The views during your ascent in a gondola (ski lift) and aerial cableway (a much larger, more heavy duty ski lift) are amazing. There are a couple stops midway up the mountain where",
          "the \"getting up there\" and \"getting back down\" are just as impressive as being up there. WOW, the sights will definitely take your breath away. Amazing",
          "I highly recommend visit to this mountain. Riding the train was spectacular & there is a shorter hike up there for about 50 min which I really recommend when up there. Beautiful view in every aspect.",
          "We started out on the cable cars, views were incredible so many photos. Took the ride to the top , more beautiful views. Went down on the train, and back to the city of Lucern on the boat. The views and experience is well worth it. You are missing out if you don\u2019t experience",

          "Still, it\u00b4s very crowded it\u00b4s worth for visit. If you can, take the Golden round, you can see both the mountain and the lake. Don\u00b4t forget your discount issues, like Swisscard or Interail-pass. We forgot those in our hotel's safebox ;)",

          "There are parking near by the chairlift entrance. No need to go by bus if you have the car as the bus station is far and it is too exhausting to walk. The mountain has 3 stops. The higher the more expensive. There are wonderful restaurant in the second & highest stop. There",

          "This is a trip of a lifetime. We went up on the Cog Railway and returned on the cable cars. The weather wasn't the best but the views were breathtaking at the top.",
          "When you visit Lucerne take the time to look across the lake and enjoy and photograph the mountain. This is a respite from the busyness of the town. Early morning and late afternoon are good times for the light, and local clouds can add punch to the shots. Some post-processing",

          "We went in mid-July, so maybe you won't feel the same way, but with the \"queue, wait, ride, then repeat\" cycle, it felt kind of like an amusement park. Doing the so-called \"golden circle\", you start by taking a boat ride from Lucerne. That was nice and relaxing; a scenic trip.",
          "The journey to Mount Pilatus is well worth it, the views are stunning and do not disappoint. I took the Golden Round Trip comprising of a boat journey from Luzern to Alpnachstad, then cog wheel railway to the summit, before descending by cable car and gondola to Kriens and",

          "This trip up and down Mount Pilatus is spectacular if you have clear blue skies. The views are breathtaking and make sure you take the cogwheel train going up and the gondola ride going down. Try to get a window seat so you can capture the beautiful shots you will see. If it's",
          "How can you go to Switzerland and be afraid of heights... You cant, pass this experience up... Its a wonderful opportunity appreciate the creation around you. After getting up there in the cars, there still a bit of hiking and walking to do, but nothing terribly difficult. Then",

          "We took the 8:12 am train to the Alpnachstad (~15 min) and then caught the cogwheel train for the 30 minute trip to the top of Pilatus. We are glad we went early as by the time we left, the tour groups had inundated the platform on the top of the mountain. We walked a number",
          "Did this by boat to and then up Mt. Pilatus on cogwheel train, down on gondolas and back to lucern by bus. Each leg of the trip was something different and each had exceptional views (except the bus of course). We left on an early boat and glad we did. The lake is very nice.",
          "If you only have time to do one thing in Lucerne, this is it. We did the cable car up the mountain, stopping halfway and did the toboggan (the kids absolutely loved it!) which is one of the best toboggan rides I've done anywhere in the world. also listen for the cowbells! there",
          "Quite simply its Breathtaking. We were staying in Basel and took the free tram to the SBB and bought a round trip ticket which included train to Lucerne, bus to Pilatus, walk to gondola, gondola up to cable car, cable car up to Mount Pilatus at 7,000 feet then mountain train to",
          "This is a beautiful mountain. Go up using the cable car, the train station is in a non-descript area but as you go up the beauty is breathtaking. It also goes quite up. Stop at a few stops and hike if you would like. From the top, there is an amazing view of the city fo lucerne",

          "The town of Lucerne is great but the best attraction and activity we had a 15 day trip was our visit to Pilatus. The Golden Circle is the best way to see the mountain with so many different ways to see it. However, the best part is simply being on top of the mountain and above",

          "One thing to keep in mind is to plan this visit when the weather is relatively clear, but when that is the case, the trip is absolutely spectacular. If you take the golden roundtrip, you go by boat from Luzern to Alpnachstad, where the steepest cogwheel train in the world takes",
          "We were in top of the world. Amazing views, worth the almost 40 minutes to get all the way to the top. Since we went off ski season, we had two views for the price of one. We found food options to be on the limited side, then again it could had been because of the off season.",

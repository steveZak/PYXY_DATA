        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "This is a definite must see while in Hoi An, even though I'm not rating it high. While you're walking through Old Town swing by and check out one of the most iconic pieces in town. The bridge itself is beautiful, ornate and is an historical \u2026",
          "Nice architecture. Nice story behind it.",
          "You can use one of your entry stubs for the bridge to visit the back room (no ticket required just to cross it). There's not much there, but it's a little interesting. Much more interesting to photograph.",

          "Reminds me of petaling street  in msia....  historical site...",
          "anyway, nothing special in this bridge, after you pass the building in this bridge, you also get same souvenir shop like outside. So if u didn't buy hoi an ticket, is not necessary to buy it just for enter this place. i didn't visit other \u2026",

          "Beautiful Japonese wood bridge. Included a temple. At the entries, statues of monkeys and dogs. Explanations on a sign on the bridge.",
          "One of the draw cards of the old-town. You should do this as part of a walking city tower if you can the get a good understanding of the worth of this bridge and its history. Good photo stop.",

          "Return to Hoi An, rediscover ancient memories.",
          "The Japanese covered bridge was built originally by the Japanese and then fixed by the Vietnamese. To go there, you will have to pay an entrance fee which is very common in Hoi An and it can be crowded inside. There is nothing special to \u2026",

          "Beautiful bridge with intricate carpentry and a temple inside.",
          "Extremely touristy place. The houses in this district were original old style and has an unique identity to it. However, the houses are now occupied by shops and become more like a shopping district than a historical town to me.",
          "The old quarter was one of my most memorable moments of Vietnam. I absolutely loved it and would love to return some day soon",
          "Nice bridge, but don't ask if you need to pay to cross it, just cross it. You have to pay a fee to visit the little museum inside, which you can also ignore.",
          "Beautiful old bridge of ancient Japanese in Hoi An, Vietnam. It is only a bridge but also a house on it. Both sides of the bridge, old Japanese set up 2 couples of Dogs and Monkeys to protect the bridge.

          "Didn't pay for the price to go pass the bridge to tell what it's since there's no reason to charge the tourist to take some photo on a bridge that they spend 2' on. Same as the fee to enter the old town, no explanation for those fee.",
          "It is very beautiful and historical place in old town",

          "Works perfectly well, just like many other bridges I've used.",

          "It is crowded everyday, but you should try once. The picture of this Japanese Covered Bridge (Ch\u00f9a C\u1ea7u) is printed on 20000VND. Hoi An Ancient Town is a worthy place for your trip in Vietnam #phuocdanang. Hope to see you there",
          "Nice place after sunset , worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful but too crowded \nMust pay to walk across this bridge\nDifficult to take photo",

          "love to be here! wish i can come again one day.",
          "Beautifully built .. It is important to see it at the day and at the night",
          "Worth a stop only if nearby. Popular for photos. So patience needed for a clear shot. Well maintained. Old bridge from 18th century. Shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes.",
          "Historical place and with lots of beautiful surroundings, particularly at night where the traditional lanterns lights up the place with burst of colours. Lots of things to buy and to eat too.",
          "Nothing special to be honest. Don't know why people are going crazy about this bridge",
          "Just an old wracked bridge. Nothing to be admired really.",
          "Beautiful place and a beautiful city",

          "It's ok but Abit dirty with the river",
          "Great history and an interesting place to visit. However, the surroundings are dirty and the crowds can be intense. You can see what you need from the outside. Inside you will find a temple and a few poorly preserved artifacts.",
          "Nice place especially at night but quite busy there",
          "Steeped in history. Attracts huge crowds. That's a little forbidding though.  The street that leads beyond the bridge is quaint and not to be missed. Am told it comes alive late evening with colourful lanterns  lighting up the place beautifully.",
          "Beautiful bridge crowded with people (tourists). Better to have a look before noon and before it gets too crowded.",
          "Very pretty bridge but packed with tourists of course. You can get tickets up the street for a number of attractions which is very reasonably priced... there are cute cafes and restaurants on the other side of the bridge, worth.exploring some of the ancient houses and chapels in the surrounding area",
          "Ticked that box.... Worth a visit but go early morning if you want to beat the crowds...",
          "This is not a thing worth making a trip for. It's alright to walk by, but nothing of any particular interest. They sell tickets, but if you go in the late afternoon or night they stop selling them and you can cross or just see it for free. It's in the middle of old town so you will see it. Very crowded",
          "Just come across but you will definitely feel the old and ancient atmosphere here",
          "Not worth paying to see this attraction.  But it a good photo-taking spot both in the day and at night.",
          "I honestly don't understand the appeal to this bridge. It is a Japanese bridge crossing a small dirty (often dried up) waterway in Vietnam. It is often packed with people walking across it and sometimes (not always) there is a person \u2026",
          "Beautiful design in a great location.",
          "Alright place although very touristy. Don't get scammed into paying for entrance.",
          "Nice place, as the all old town.\n\nFor tourists : you don't have to pay to cross the bridge. Some bad people just try to steal from you some easy money.",
          "It's really quite small and gets overrun by tourists sometimes. It's a lovely little feature. But it's just a quick stop.",
          "It was interesting but a little underwhelming. Historically a great sight but aesthetically a little boring, especially compared to the rest of Hoi An",
          "Very interesting part of Ancient Town",
          "Very old and historic. Bridge has not changed in 20 years since last visit. Hoi An has.",

          "Nice bridge, but not sure what all the fuzz is about.",
          "Nice attraction to see. Doesn't really take a lot of time so it's not worth it to only go here for this. However, you will probably stumble upon it regardless",

          "It was a good and quick photo op",
          "Incredibly crowded. For some reason there's a ticket control only at the eastern gate but you can cross the bridge freely from the west. After 19:00 there's no more ticket control.",
          "Parking scams, be prepared\n\nBe extremely careful when you park a motorbike. There's NO sign saying that you can or cannot park inside the town. Apparently, there are some speakers telling you what you can do or not but we didn't hear \u2026",
          "The bridge is nice, but it's packed and there is a fee to pay to cross it.",
          "A charming little bridge at the hotel entrance to the Old Town Hoi An. Very instagrammable location both day and night. \nFree to cross but there is a box for donations for the upkeep!",
          "It's good to take a walk along the river and enjoy the atmosphere. \n\nHowever the bridge is sooooo crowded! I mean it's always crowded no matter weekdays or weekends \ud83d\ude22 \n\nI stayed in Hoi An for more than 2 weeks and only came to this bridge \u2026",
          "The most visited attraction at Hoi An. The bridge cut across popular tourist attraction. You are likely to cross the bridge a few times.\nThere is a fees to cross the bridge.\nThere are stone statue of dogs and monkey inside the bridge. and \u2026",

          "It is a beautiful bridge in the old town of Hoian.",
          "It is a gorgeous bridge that we walked through without paying. I think you can see more of it if you pay but we personally felt this was a rip off for how big it is.\n\nThe bridge is gorgeous to see from a lower down bridge as well so that's \u2026",
          "Japanese-style bridge. I was not asked money to walk over the bridge and enter the  small house.",
          "A cool bridge with an interesting story! Best to go there early in the morning if you want photos without any people.",
          "De rigueur for every visit to Hoi An.  There is some historic value to to the bridge, but so does every structure in this UNESCO World Heritage site.   My favorite part of the bride is the two stone dog statues at one end of the bridge, \u2026",
          "Beautiful bridge in a UNESCO World heritage site.. can get hot and crowded",
          "Rather crowded from early in the morning (8am>) till late in de evening. Would recommend going before 8am to get a good look at the bridge",
          "Authentic, interesting, crowded. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was until after I was there. It\u2019s a functional, nondescript feature of Hoi An. Second time around I took in the magnificence. There\u2019s tons of tourists on this bridge and it became quite uncomfortably crowded quickly. From the outside it\u2019s gorgeous.",
          "It was a bridge. It was cool to see but if you miss it I don't think you'll be sad.",
          "A must visit while in Hoi An. It is easily accessed and very well preserved.",
          "Ok",

          "Well...just a brigde, you can take a picture from outside because u have to pay to cross...omg\n\nLike if it helped you",
          "Beautiful bridge that dates back to the 18th century. This is the bridge that the Japanese supposedly built to reach the Chinese quarter within Hoi An. \n\nThe architecture is beautiful to look at both from a distance and while walking \u2026",

          "Interesting wooden bridge built over a 3 year period, couldn't find any nail. Still in good shape. Worth a visit.",
          "Full of tourists, must buy a ticket to cross over to the inner market area....",

          "It's super busy in this area because of the lantern festival. We walked around for sight seen and there were a lot of tourists and also local people. You can get two scopes of gelato ice cream for 65k right before going through the bridge. \u2026",
          "Beautiful but smaller than expected.",
          "It's just magical.",
          "I thought it was just ok . Ok I am being nice. Saw from another bridge. Did not go in as I understand that you need to.pay. you need to verify that though. I don't know the story behind this. Maybe that is why the bridge has a special meaning to the town.",
          "One of the symbolic of Hoi An old town. The only things should be well reserve right there is water resource. Now starting smelling bad.",
          "Honestly quite underwhelming, and also very crowded. Quite interesting to see the marks where the water level rose during flooding. However, you'd be best just walking through and attempting to snap a mediocre photo.",
          "Sad reminder of the ancient people - over take other people land. Never again happening",
          "Didn't really like it that much. If you arrive after dark, the place is swarming with tourists vying for a spot to take a picture with the bridge. Noise and crowd really threw off the ambience. If it's of any significance, there is barely any water under the bridge, with the remains stale, filled with weed and clearly inactive.",
          "It's a bridge, like, how do I rate a bridge, it's cool sure but come on Google.",
          "so busy and nothing really that special. Hoi an is pretty over rated unless you visit during a festival",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "As soon as you arrive you will be approached to buy a cocktail which includes the hire of a sunbed and brolly. It was cheap so worth doing. Ladies selling various trinkets also drop by. Ours was lovely and not pushy and once we bought something left us alone. Sand and sea were",
          "Had a lovely few days chilling on this beach in front of the Sea and Sand restaurant shack. Beach is spotless and the sunbeds / parasols in good order. Food and drinks are good prices 25k beer, 55k bahn mi etc. Order some drinks during the day from the helpful friendly guy and",
          "Really nice beach and fun to bicycle out there. Be aware that you do not have to pay for the sun / beach chairs if you tell the ladies asking for money that you will eat at their restaurants. They will not tell you themselves. And if you walk down further the beach it gets",
          "Very nice. Surf looks good. Maybe a little dangerous today for swimming. Relaxing location. Very close to Hoian town.",
          "What can I say. It's a beach! It's near the town and it's really nice. Your can cycle there if you have a bicycle at your accommodation",
          "Clean and nice beach . Everyday we come to this beach for swimming. There are many people in the summer because this is is very hot . The kids needs water for cooler",
          "Typical beach...sun beds for hire and pretty clean and not crowded at all. Nice place to chill out away from the hustle and bustle of town.",
          "Verry nice beach near H\u1ed9i An. We are going here by scooter. Many restaurant for choix whit the good price.",
          "When coming straight from Hoi An, you arrive to covered parking lot of bikes. This is run by super rude person who will want to over charge you and scream at you. Do not give money to this person. There are bars around where you can park, get a drink with no drama. Just turn a",
          "Nice beach when weather good. Sunbeds and umbrellas. Plenty of places to eat and drink although they are expensive.",
          "This beach is lovely and clean, the sea is wavy but it seemed a long shallow entry so it's not too bad. Some of the hotels have lost beach front access due to errosion I guess but they simply run a mini bus to a better area and provide sun loungers / umbrellas. Local cafes and",
          "The beach was nice and clean. The waves were quite high when we were there. If you buy something from the restaurants, you will get a free sunbed for the day.",
          "Ate at sun and sea, great food and free use of bed if you are eating. beds very comfy. great choice of food and drinks. great service",
          "Rent a beach chair and watch everyone have a great time. Cold beers at the beach, and the best burgers from Burger Craft one block from the beach.",
          "The beach isn\u2019t as nice as home (Australia) but the sand is fine and soft and there are sunloungers and umbrellas set up everywhere, free to use as long as you eat or drink at their establishment. It is relatively clean too. A nice place to relax for a while.",
          "We stayed here while visiting Hoi An and we really enjoyed how relaxing this beach community is. Lounge chairs available for 150 dong rental or the purchase of a drink. Only approached by one peddler in three visits.",
          "This beach is not so great the sand is brown and the water is dirty .it is very windy and has some pretty big waves",
          "Cycled from Hoi An. Beach was clean. Everyone was friendly. Sea was warm. Beer was ice cold. Perfect.",
          "We went to the beach for a day trip from Hoi An which was a good call. The beach is quite crowded with people, bars, restaurants and vendors everywhere. We even had to pay to park our bikes. The beach bars are nice though and give a relaxing atmosphere.",
          "Just lovely. Waters great, sand it great. Enjoyed this beach. Strong cross current running parallel to the beach.",
          "Great spot for an early morning swim or body surf. It is an easy, less than 5 km cycle along flat roads from the Hoi An old town area. The water is warm!",
          "The weather was perfect in January. Beautiful and sunny with a nice cool breeze. Long sandy beach with plenty of beach beds, ours cost 50,000 per bed. The water was cool and refreshing, but a bit brown for me to swim in. But was nice lying on the beach bed and having a beer in",
          "The beach is endless and clean. The sea in January is warm and clean with great waves. Not so crowded, just perfect!",
          "Limited beaches available due to many many rocky waterfronts. Most resorts create their own sand and water experience.",
          "We visited the beach and use the facilities of the Wind & Moon restaurant through their hook up with the La Siesta hotel. It was not too crowded. The sea was nice (a little cold but it was December) and the sand was great as well A few people selling stuff but they did not",
          "Although it not the most beautiful beach we have visited in south east Asia, it is a nice beach to spend a day or two during your visit to Hoi An.",
          "Plenty of beach umbrellas and cafes along the beach. Quite peaceful even though you do get the hawkers approaching you to buy their souvenirs and sun glasses etc. A lot of development and construction going on so sadly in a few years time the primitive charm will be lost and",
          "Lengthy beachfront with multiple restaurants, bars, and lounge chairs. Not too busy earlier in the morning and easy to grab a pair of chairs in a quieter are.",
          "Beautiful beach - Life guards to assist. The Deck House offered good service - food and drinks all part of the package .",
          "We stayed at the Boutique Resort on Bang Beach. Our kids loved playing on the beach and boogie boarding in the surf. It was beautiful.",
          "What a beautiful place..I absolute love it here..if youget the chance when visiting hoi an its a must we have been goi g to the WIND MOON shack and its lovely..they give you a beach towel & the sunbeds are free (buy a drink) the food is delicious too..I can highly recommend",
          "We visited beach on a shuttle from hotel in Hoi An. There were good bars, sunbeds, umbrellas etc and the beach was better carried for than Cua Dia with regular rubbish collections. The beach also does not suffer from erosion and it was pleasant to walk along it beachcoming. Best",
          "Our hotel had a partner beach club, so we were able to take a shuttle down to the beach. Had plenty of loungers, the actual staff working there were great! We were bothered a LOT by hawkers, though. I assume it depends on the season and perhaps how many other people are",
          "Beach is ok- more notably having our pushbikes aggressively taken from us, without asking, by an extremely angry man on arrival wasn\u2019t great (he was part of a motley crew of slightly intimidating old women greeting people on arrival). When I refused to agree to the charge, he",
          "This beach is located approx 20mins outside hoi an.. It stretches for miles whichever part of it you find yourselves pitching for the day.. On a very clear day the city of Da Nang is clearly seen at one end.. On parts of this beach you can experience paragliding, jetsking and",
          "Lots of restaurants to choose from and it\u2019s a nice white sandbeach. Some restaurants have live music or band.",
          "We enjoyed lunch at a little cafe above the beach to enjoy the breeze and the view. Loads of places offering you to use their sun loungers and pay for drinks and food or vise versa. Odd concept for us Aussies, beaches are public land and such things are illegal at home.",
          "My wife and myself went with our daughter and our two grandchildren to the beach. We went there using the hotel (Golden Pearl, Hoi An) shuttle bus as they have a part of the beach for their guests exclusive use.Lovely and clean and a beach restaurant beside it. Was a great",
          "This beach is located on a long stretch of waterfront. Very relaxing for busy city dwellers. Restaurants and cafes all along the beach, serving drinks, light snacks and meals of reasonable price.",
          "I have visited most of the beaches along this stretch of coast and An Bang in my opinion is the best. It has a lot of good beach bars like the Soul Bar around the centre, good sand, kept fairly clean and plenty of activities like surfing, jet skis or para sailing to keep you",
          "We stayed at An Bang Seaside Village Homestay which was fantastic and right on the beach. Loved it and perfect weather.",
          "This beach was within walking distance of our home stay. For only $1.50 you can get a lounge chair and umbrella (or buy an iced coffee for $1.50 and get them for free!). It's very clean and my children found it a great place to build sand castles. Not too crowded, at least not",
          "An Bang Beach may be touristy and crowded, it is still a pretty beach to rest and relax. If you prefer quiet time here, I recommend you to go to Be Cu Beach Restaurant located two streets away. Food and drinks price here is cheaper and you have the most inspiring views from the",
          "This is a great beach with some fun activities such as parasailing. The water and sands were beautiful.",
          "We were so disappointed with this beach, it needs some investment and a really good clean. There was plastic everywhere.",
          "Considering the crowds elsewhere this is a beautiful and quiet beach. We were there on a partially cloudy day but the water is warm enough for a swim, compared to the water in Sydney's beaches at this time of the year. The hotel has its own restaurant facing the sea and beach",
          "Very beautiful place to stay for a day and relax from the city. Nice bars and restaurants to enjoy the beach and relax",
          "This beach is wonderfully clean, and lined with restaurants that serve cold beer and food. The water was beautifully warm.",
          "This beach is nice but coming from Australia we are spoilt with beautiful beaches everywhere so An Bang pales in comparison. The whole stretch of beach is covered in beach beds and bars and restaurants so while the view is nice it has an over populated feeling. The beach has \"no",
          "We have just been to An Bang beach and found our feet and thongs covered in black tar spots. We didn\u2019t see anything walking in the sand but later discovered them. We had to scrub our thongs and feet. Very worrying as our children had these all over their feet. Luckily we did not",
          "Had a lovely morning on the beach. Paid for sun loungers under thatch umbrella. Weather was great. No wind. Lovely walk along the beach.",
          "Lovely beach only draw back was the huge pile of sand bags but of course that\u2019s due to the safety precautions I guesss... but otherwise lovely with locals offering you chairs and coconut to chill, number of good restaurants very close by the beach. Super nice to ride a bike",
          "An Bang is this wonderful cosy local beach where you pass the local market in the morning, learn to know the local restaurants and the few other families at the beach and the local restaurants. At the same time Hoi An is 4$ in a cab away with its crazy wounderful ambient.",
          "Great beach because is very large with restaurants and places for drinks scattered throughout. Different sections were busier than others so will accommodate those seeking traditional busier beaches as well as those seeking a more quiet setting. There are a couple areas with",
          "Spent 10 days in a villa near AnBang Beach with my three young kids and we had a great time! Beds are available for 30kvnd per day and the beach is quite clean compared to other we can find in SEA. A lots of cool places and small bars on the beach such as Soul Bar, Hmong Sister,",
          "nice sand and a reasonable selection of cafe\u2019s and restaurants without being overdeveloped .The beach slopes quite a bit and then flattens making it ideal for older but not so good for the sea inexperienced under 5\u2019s .The waves are good for body surfing especially for the novice",
          "The beach is a bit dirty but from my perspective it is better than other nearby beaches. Lot of drinking and eating options, sunbeds are also available. There were huge waves during our visit but still a decent place to relax.",
          "I was really looking forward to visiting the beaches (An Bang) in particular while in Hoi An. So disappointed, really dirty with lots of trash washed up and in piles (mainly plastic bottles and broken polystyrene) and a used condom metres from where a child was digging in the",
          "the beach is not as nice as my khe beach but it\u2019s near to old town, u can try sky diving, speed boat ride here. come if u have nothing to do",
          "This beach and town is quaint and varied. The beach is long and filled with places to sit and enjoy a meal. Be careful if the red flag is flying as the South China Sea can be rough! Would definitely pick a homestay around this area if I did not already have a place in Hoi An.",
          "An Bang Beach. Fantastic long! clean and empty Beach in the beginning of December. At the middle of the month more people came and at Christmas time there are lots of Asian people here, nice. Not som many Europeans, as in Nha Trang, Mui Ne and Phu Quoc. Fantastic good",
          "For a rest from the sight seeing in Hoi An and around their beach is a nice break. We wanted a break that had some beach time, sightseeing time and this beach gave us that. Worth a visit.",
          "A very nice place to visit! It is about 4 km from Hoian Ancient town, you can get there by bicycle that is provided by your hotel. Before getting to An Bang beach, you can make a drop at Tr\u00e0 Qu\u1ebf vegatable village.",
          "Great atmosphere on the beach. We were lucky with the weather and 10 and 13 year olds had a ball. Parents able to relax for price of a $2 beer at a laid back place.",
          "A beach with lively atmosphere, lots of people around, cafes, beach beds... the beach has fine sand and nice water. You can walk quite far into the water and the waves are quite nice, not too strong but let\u2019s you enjoy!!",
          "We cycled down from old town and it was great fun However as you approach the road to the beach there are places to leave your bike Just before the crossroads at the beach there is a guy who will try and stop you he will stand on the road demanding you stop so he can look after",
          "This was amazing , blue calm water , great food,drink . Special place . Our hotel Lantana organised free bus to and from .",
          "We went when it was hot and sunny and it was busy without being too much so. There are loads of free beach equipment for bathing in return for buying a drink if you wish, but not pressured to do so. The beach is sand, clean and flat. The sea is quite rough but clear of sea",
          "We went twice here, first time just to wander and the second time to relax on one of the sunbeds for the day. It's an easy cycle from Hoi An old town. You park your cycle before the beach with one of the parking people. It's 10000dong per bike for the day. I'm not sure how",
          "You have to pay for a chair to sit on and even if you sit on the sand, you may get \u201cmoved on\u201d by the particular group who manage that section of the beach. Constant harassment by hawkers selling sunglasses, bracelets etc. the water was a decent temperature. Quite nice for a",
          "Got there cycling, small fee (5000 dong) to safely park your bike. Shops and restaurants along the beach as well as long chairs. The long chairs belong to the restaurants and are free if you eat something at the restaurant (minimum of 120000 pp) so be sure to check the menu and",
          "Lovely sand, nice views and fun ocean with some great waves. Too: after 3 the sun dips behind the trees in December so you\u2019re in the shade if sitting on the beach do get there earlier if the Sun is your god. Sun sets 5:15pm this time of year but ocean still warm",
          "Water was freezing but beach is huge and lots of restaurants, stores and bars in the area. A few vendors but not harassing.",
          "Really good place with kids.Can reccomend La Plage for dinner and Bikini Bottom for breakfast. Sea crab further down the beach was excellent too.",
          "Loved this beach. I was close to the north end so it was a little quieter than the south end which was great. Lots of great restaurants on the beach",
          "An Bang beach is close to the city center. We visited the beach around noon. There are many shops & shacks along the beach. You can have a few drinks and food. The sunbeds are free if you order food. The beach hardly has space available for really enjoying the view. Afternoon",
          "We went to Dolphin bar and grill. Nice walk up and down the beach followed by a few drinks and snacks. Didn\u2019t swim as it was a bit cold but would be ok in hotter months.",
          "Am bang beach is quite pleasant, a wonderful place to spend a day while on honeymoon. You can put your feet in the water, relax on the beach chairs (for around 50,000 per person or free with a meal) or take a long walk on the beach.",
          "Lovely beach with nice activities for kids jets ski and paragliding . Good food and drinks priced reasonably",
          "Scruffy, dirty and a mess unfortunately. I would imagine at the beginning of the season they make sure it's nice but certainly its not at the moment.... How disappointing!",
          "Terrible beach. The water is very dirty looking and when you walk along the beach all you see is plastic bottles and other rubbish everywhere. Left after about 20 minutes. Would not go back",
          "Beach is clean around beach clubs and hotels. Water is warm. Nice place to hang out for the day. You can walk for hours .",
          "I grew up in New England with 8 miles of non stop saydy beach 75-100 feet at low tide so it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to beaches. An Bang is GORGEOUS! This is a much more low key beach than looking north to Da Nang. We were told this is where the locals go so",
          "An Bang makes for a delightful half-day or full day trip from Hoi An. There are many restaurants that will let you use their beach chairs and umbrellas if you buy food and drinks. It is very quiet in the morning but gets busy in the afternoon.",
          "Definitely taking your life in your hands if you brave the surf over the knees. But a nice place to spend an afternoon.",
          "We cycled to the beach from our hotel in Hoi An. As we approached the beach we passed a parking lot where a man and woman both came screaming at us telling us we had to pay straight away and park up. We couldn\u2019t even see the beach from here and so turned around and cycled",
          "Lovely and Nice Beach near the main centre of Hoi An (5-6km) from our hotell . Many option if u want sunbed or just lay on the sand",
          "When I went to An Bang Beach. It had some storm so heavy wind on the beach and I just sat in the beach club and I had enjoy see the storm windy beach.",
          "Arrived on bicycles. Accosted by women blowing whistle and demanding $1 to look after our bikes. THIS IS A SCAM. Dont pay her just chain bike around the corner for free. Beach and sea beautiful. Hire a sunlounger for 50,000 dong (\u00a31.50 ish) And crack on. Well wprth the 3km",
          "This beach is just lower average, compared to others in Vietnam. Hoi An is not a beach destination of course.",
          "We found ourselves at the extreme north and south ends of the beach which were nice and quiet and also very clean.",
          "We will be back tomorrow! Loving the relaxation on the beach. Very few people here at this time. Great food and service!",
          "Place was ok, we went to soul restaurant and didnt like the food at all, the seating area was nice though.",
          "Not a touristy beach at all. Loved the local fishermen using their basket boats. Had one of the BEST noodle salads from one of the little food stands.",
          "We were not even expecting to visit a beach except we had some time and googled and this came up. We arrived early before 8am and the stretches of sand were wide and nice and the sea is rather choppy. But the facilities are a bit run down and there were strays every where. If",
          "Lovely beach, with lots of small bars at the back reasonably priced. Clean and tidy, plenty of places for hiring beds/umbrella set up on your towel. Very relaxed atmosphere, water sports available if it\u2019s your thing or just relax in the sun.",
          "Beach was very nice friendly staff service was great, went for a swim water was very nice abit dirty in the distance but other than that can't complain. Afew people selling stuff on the beach but if you politely say no thank you they will move on. Will definitely visit tomorrow.",
          "A great place to chill out, whether it\u2019s walking along the beach or enjoying a drink and a bite to eat at one of many places.",
          "For those of us here in the middle of November, we arrived right as a storm was hitting the south. It was raining quite a lot and the water was a bit rough. The first day we went out to the beach, our heart was broken at the amount of rubbish on the beach. By our third day",
          "A nice beach, within cycling distance of Hoi An which added to the experience. If you have had enough of being in the city or doing tours and need a relaxing day on the beach then An Bang is nice enough. You can park your bike in the bike park for a small 30,000 fee where a man",
          "beach is a good place for relaxing. Nearby you find seafood-restaurants low budget and lecious food. around streets in small village you find many massage and coffe-shops for having a breake.",
          "I was looking forward to relaxing on this beach for a few days. However, I was just disappointed in it. There is trash everywhere, which is extremely sad.",
          "Awesome place, if you are looking for a laid back holiday with great food and lovely people this is the place",
          "We biked from the Old Town on the seaside (a few of kilometers) then was capable to invest time relaxing in the beach prior to heading back. The surface on the beach is flat so it is a drive. Nevertheless, one ought to invest a little cost to \"park\" the bike you have. Do check",
          "The area of the beach straight across from the traffic light is very commercialized. To park bikes and scooters there are charges. The restaurants at the end of the road are big and impersonal. The one on the left wouldn't seat me because I was a solo. The food is ok. Service is",
          "It\u2019s good to come here in Nov. Quite chill and not too many people. But it\u2019s the raining season so sometimes you may encounter the rain.",
          "We went to this beach and it was full of plastic bottles, plastic bags, polystyrene and lightbulbs (!). We put some of them in the bin but we weren't here for long. I don't know how the people can put their towel among the trash, that is disgusting. And therefore crooks are",
          "This is a nice beach in easy reach of Hoi An. There\u2019s lots of nice waterfront options for drinks and food! Unfortunately the swell was quite big when I visited so swimming was not permitted, but it was cheap to hire a sun lounger so I sunbathed instead! Reading other reviews on",
          "Long sandy beach with bar owned loungers on. Our hotel did a shuttle run to and from the beach although we used their free bikes to visit the beach, which was clean! You could hire jet skis and go parasailing if you wanted although the ride was only around 2 mins airtime so not",
          "On the day we visited the amount of water bottles strewn around the beach was unreal. Every 5-10 metres was another. The water in Vietnam is undrinkable so everyone is served in plastic bottles. But the places along the beach front appear to make no attempt to collect them.",
          "I love An Bang beach. It\u2019s clean it\u2019s got some waves and it\u2019s easy to get to. There are plenty of little restaurants on the beach. I prefer to walk down a bit further to the smaller vendors that have a small amount of lounges. I always go to Kim Ong she is so friendly and",
          "This place can be a hit or miss. In November when the skies are cloudy and there aren\u2019t that many tourists yet, it\u2019s okay\u2014there are relatively few touts, and I was able to find deck chair to use for free. Even so, I can\u2019t honestly say this is a beautiful beach. There is trash",
          "A clean and sandy beach with good waves for fun swimming. Plenty of sun beds and bar / restaurants with toilets and fresh water showers",
          "An Bang beach is a great beach where you can relax on beach loungers and sip cocktails, eat fruit and relax. The service from the staff is great, and there are water activities at the main entrance. If you stay in An Bang, it is even better as the hotels are a stones throw away",
          "sea is warm and sortof grey-green, bars are a bit rip-offy until you wander far down from main road. it's just a bit tacky, even though the splash and beer after hot day is refreshing",
          "Murky water, overpriced restaurants, overpriced parking for bicycles, too many touts and so busy, even in the off season. If you're into spending top dollar on sun beds, food and drink with constant touts trying to sell you things, this is the place for you.",
          "Extremely crowded, touristy and overpriced. Dumping murky waves. Sooo disappointed. The world has so much better to offer, so huge pass, you can do better \u2639",
          "Was very clean beach and food was really really tasty, but expensive for vietnam Bring own water, and be prepared to pay premium price if u have a meal",

          "Moved from Hoi An to An Bang for a change of pace. Wow! Such a laid back beautiful place. Lots of restaurants to try (Cay Me, Purple Lantern), great cheap cocktails (with acoustic music at Soul Kitchen)and a beautiful beach. Dozens of spas to choose from for massages and",
          "We visited the beach twice. The first day we parked our bikes in the paid area (beware they try to charge you extra as a foreigner, pay no more than 10,000 each). It was a windy day, the beach was closed to swimming and we were hassled by every restaurant and seller on the sand.",
          "By now you can guess the secret it out about Hoi An so any way we can avoid the crowds, we did. We rode our Silk Marina Hotel bikes to An Bang Beach and it was a pretty cool ride passing rice paddies and water buffalo. It took us about 20-25 minutes and mostly flat riding. Once",
          "Beautiful beach with benches to relax on. You just have to order food and drinks to get free benches. Otherwise you have to pay.",
          "A laid back beach area that is likely to develop very quickly. A cool little bar called Double Cat opens late with a great host. Driftwood has great pizza. Get there while you can !! An Bang Beach Villa has excellent service and a great price too",
          "Nice long sandy beach nearing to the old town. Sand was clean, water was quite rough so not good for swimming and a fair few water sport motor vehicles were also jetting around in the vicinity (not in a separate area) so might be a bit dangerous if they don\u2019t see you. Lots of",
          "This is the beach to go to in Hoi An. It is a little further outside of the city, but well worth it. Plenty of amenities. Private and public beach options. Lots of food and drink with beachside service from a selection of restaurans.",
          "Lovely sandy beach with warm shallow waters, very clean, lots of sunbeds available. We got a shuttle bus from our hotel which many offer, and had sunbeds at Moyo Beach Club, really trendy venue with good music and seating/pool looking out to see and free sunbeds & towels on the",
          "Sandy with clean, clear water & not rough the days I was there. What more can I say? The type of beach you could dream of floating about in on a tropical holiday",
          "We arrived by bike. We knew we could ride our bikes to our preferred dining venue and park there for free. However men manning the 'parking' space as you arrived jumped out in front of us and told us to stop. We said no, they followed us. Only when we explained we were going",
          "Careful when riding your bike here, as there are people trying to force you to park at their spot and pay them for it. I had a guy run after me and grab my bike, preventing me from passing him in an attempt to convince me to park at his lot. You can park for free at the",
          "We visit the An bang beach for one day. The beach is beautiful, with clean and beautiful water. Very recommended",
          "A great location and easily accessible by taxi (approximately 100,000 Vietnamese Dong from Hoi An city centre). The beach is environmentally friendly, clean, tidy and well maintained. We experienced a relaxed vibe throughout the day, Kukun bar & restaurant (separate review)",
          "An Bang beach in Hoi An is a must see!!! Warm water, smooth sandy beaches, a huge number of cabanas to rent for a small fee of $10.00 CAD for 2 recliners and a huge umbrella. Great local food at the restaurants. There\u2019s pra-sailing, surf boarding (waves aren\u2019t that huge) and",
          "If you are looking for a secluded expanse of sand this would not be it. On the other hand if you want a continuous strip of bars & restaurants, cheek-by-jowl loungers as far as the eye can see & hot,hot sand - then this place is idyllic. The current was also too strong for",
          "I\u2019ve been to beach\u2019s all over the world. I was really impressed when a vendor ask me would I like to purchase something. I answered no and the vendor moved on instead of trying to pressure me into purchasing something from him.",

          "The beach is clean and sandy, hardly any rubbish and no stones or seaweed. The sea itself is very clean and warm",
          "We spent two quiet and relaxing days at the beach with mango smoothies and local beer! Waves are just incredible! If you are around definitely worth the visit!",

          "We strolled on the lovely beach, warm water which was desecrated by the amount of litter and rubbish that was strewn around. More care should be taken of this beautiful beach.",
          "We came to get out of the heat, and allowed the children to swim. Nice beach, with a slight undercurrent, however safe for children. Taxi was 70 VN from Old Town. Plenty of restaurants and places to drink along the beach.",

          "Very long sandy beach great to walk along. Sea very rough in September have been before in May much calmer then. Lots of water sports if that\u2019s your thing. All the hotels have beach clubs they use . You do get the vendors trying to sell you things all the time drives you nuts.",
          "A Nice place to spend a few hours swimming. Bargain for a seat under an umbrella or check with the local restaurant to see if they own chairs. Then they\u2019ll be free if you eat at the restaurant after or during",
          "Visited this beach while holidaying in Hoi An.. Its aprox 25mins out of town, but our hotel offered free minibus too and from this beautiful beach. You are literally just feet away from the sea itself. Unusual flow of tide water here, and the undercurrent is quite strong, so",
          "we cycled out there independently from Hoi An which isn't far. There are plenty of bike hire places and didn't use the main road cycled through the rice paddies and followed the direction of the main road and palm trees. we swum and relaxed with a coconut drink. There are plenty",
          "Took a taxi from our Hoi An Hotel for 100,000VND each way. We didn't stay long as we just wanted to visit the beach and had had a long day touring. The water was warm but the day overcast so not so inviting. Plenty of people enjoying it but not crowded. Nice beach...",
          "Fantastic seafood available. We stayed under the umbrella for 4 hours and even Tho it was cloudy. We got roasted, be careful.",
          "I felt harrassed every 10 seconds by the local sellers... The best thing to do is to walk a lot further and to avoid this place at all cost. Beach is dirty.",
          "I stayed in the An Bang Beach area of Hoi An for a couple of days and fell in love with the scenery, people, and food. You can't go wrong visiting An Bang Beach!",
          "Had a great day of relaxing by the beach. We had access to private beach area and lounge, as we were staying at Little Riverside Hoi An. The bar/restaurant had a great view with good selection of food.",
          "An Bang beach is beautiful, clean & has fabulous restaurants. The Deckhouse being our favourite. You can see all the way to Da Nang on a clear day while swimming in glorious warm water. Lovely beach to walk on when its cool.",
          "We have spent around 2 weeks in Vietnam and wanted to chill a bit. We really liked the beach as there is not much people. Our hotel had a place for us to leave the bikes and lie down which made things even better!",
          "We spent an afternoon at the beach, mainly at The Shore Club. Amazing spot, where we rented a 'cabana' for our family of 5 to enjoy. Superb food, good cocktails and very efficient staff with fairly good English.",

          "Clean beach with nice restaurants. There was some good waves so could body surf. A few people trying to sell you stuff but after saying no didn't bother you again.",
          "Very nice beach. The sand was golden and soft and the waves were big, which wasn\u2019t an issue but maybe something to be aware of. We walked down to the right (towards Salt Pub and Lucky Beach) as it was more secluded and quieter.",
          "If your after a gorgeous beach with good waves and clean, white sand then this beach is not it (try the Australian beaches)",
          "This was a great way to relax! I rented a bike and went from the ancient town down the road to the beach. It\u2019s very simple, no turns, so just follow the road and look out for motorbikes. You have to park your bike somewhere and there are lots of pushy people that try to get you",
          "Fabulous food! Right along the foreshore are many restaurants with have views over the beach. They also provide loungers with umbrellas on the sand and will deliver to you there. We sat for hours drinking Mojito's and cracking coal cooked marinated sweet crabs and calamari.",
          "Arrived early to avoid the heat. PARKING Got the shake down to park the bicycles at parking station. When we arrived there was 1 bicycle, the people watching the bikes knew exactly which 2 bikes were ours, even though there was a sea of bikes on our return. In hindsight with",

          "My girlfriend and I came out here for a swim on our last day in Hoi An. The water was the clearest I\u2019ve ever been in and felt so good, \u201ctalcum powder\u201d sand, and doesn\u2019t get too deep too quickly. We were probably a half a mile from the nearest beach hotel, so we weren\u2019t around",
          "The beach was about a 10 minute ride in a taxi from the centre of Hoi An. It was clean with chairs and umbrellas as far as the eye can see. The cahirs where you first enter the beach are about 75,000 for the day. There are some places to buy food and drinks where you enter",
          "A good beach If you want to escape the crowds of tourists in Hoi An. We were staying in the next street to the night market and found this a fairly easy 20-30 minute bike ride. Fairly clean beach, lovely warm water and lots of water sports to take part In or watch. Shallow",
          "We went twice here. We stayed in the old town and had a bus service to get there and back. The beach lounges were also part of the deal. The beach is no way to Australian standards so don\u2019t expect that if you are from Australia. We did not swim as it is not as clean as what we",
          "Our hotel the Hadana arranged a shuttle and a private restauraunt on the beach we sat on lounges and enjoyed the lovely scenery and great food and drinks at very reasonable prices. Even the vendors on the beach selling anything and everything were nice.",
          "The beach is a fabulous place to be at, but unfortunately it is very crowded with lounges right next to each other. The cafe/restaurant is large with lots of room for diners, and the menu is great with a lot of variety.",
          "My friend and I came to the beack and spent about 15 minutes there. We payed 50k per chair, for dirty and uncomfortable chairs. The beach itself was full of garbage and very agressive salespeople. No bathrooms or anything of the sort, and a pretty fishy smell too.",
          "Beautiful beach with great vibes. Getting a chair is pricey and the beach clubs but worth it to stay out of the sun!",
          "We went to the more quiet part of An Bang Beach 2 times during our stay in Hoi An. The first day, we approached some lounge chairs and the lady told us we needed to order food and drinks for each person (there were 8 of us). We obliged, but the next time we just said we were",
          "It\u2019s actually a lovely beach early in the morning. Great places to chill all day. I like the laid back vibe. The morning is best. The ocean is calm and there aren\u2019t crowds. It\u2019s absolutely worth spending a relax day here. by late morning the wind picks up and the sea gets",
          "Nice for a chill, drink coconuts in the water. 150k dong for a couple sun beds. Heaps of places to get a drink and eat. Beautiful view of Cham island. Jet ski and parasailing available. The biggest drawback is the amount of hawkers. You\u2019ll be saying no all day. Some will go on",
          "Not too over-crowded and relatively clean. We went towards late afternoon, prior to sunset - around 5pm. The sun wasn't so hot at the time so it was enjoyable.",
          "We really enjoyed this beach! It's not very fancy, but it's got a very chill vibe. There are tons of chairs and umbrellas laid out across the beach and almost all of the restaurants will let you have chairs for the day for free as long as you buy something (even one drink",
          "A very lovely beach, shallow water and clear. You see fishermen in the mornings it\u2019s picture perfect... And the sunrise is well worth it too",
          "Nice beach, commercial and touristy but expected that. You need to pay to park bicycles. Can be a rip. We parked for free 100 m up road at a lovely rustic cafe called the Juice Bar. If you love fresh healthy food and drink I highly recommend. Had a delicious healthy juice and",
          "Lovely beach but the water was not blue (maybe because of weather). But the food was delicious and reasonable.",
          "Nice enough beach but nothing special. A string of eateries lines it, each with beach chairs and umbrellas. Some seem to rent you towels too. You can stay for hours and go for a swim as long as you buy something. Be aware that some will charge extra for use of the chair if you",
          "Went to the beach mid week so not too many people there. Easy to find a beach lounger and negotiated a price for the day. Not too many hawkers annoyed us and were able to order food and drinks which were delivered to us - really it was a just a very relaxing day at this",
          "One of our fav beaches in Vietnam. Tons of restaurants and bars to grab drinks and food. Be prepared to pay for a beach chair + umbrella (make sure you go early to get a deal and bargain). The ocean actually felt cool and refreshing here. We saw no jelly fish and didn\u2019t notice",
          "As far as beaches go in comparison to Australia we have some of the best. You have to go to experience it. You can pay to sit on sun beds or just take your own towel for the sand. There are lifesavers and it looks like there can be some undertow. Not much surf. There are plenty",
          "We go to the private beach of sea village restaurant, great staff nice food in good price and great beach",
          "i may be bias - comparing it to all the beaches we have visited, this is just an average one for us. it\u2019s probably good enough if you just want to have a few hours of getting away from the crowd in hoi an old town, walking in the sand and playing with waves. just don\u2019t expect",
          "This is a great beach, full of bars and restaurants, watersports and shops, clean sand and swimmable sea but if it\u2019s a bit full on for you, you only have to walk 10 minutes down the shore to Tan Than beach (it\u2019s known locally as) and it\u2019s much quieter, where you can sleep on",
          "When you arrive at Ah Bang don't go straight into the main car park area where you will be pressured to pay to park your bike or scooter. Take first road on the left and there is beach access down alleyways, generally with restaurants and lounge chairs available. You don't have",
          "If you want to hang out at a busy beach this place has it all food ,cocktails,beer, music and safe beach no shortage of taxis and Purple Lantern restaurant(great food)just around the corner this place is happenin !!!",
          "We stayed at the Sol An Bang hotel, which has a couple of swimming pools and direct access to the beach, with its own set of sun loungers, cabanas and a beach bar. The beach is very clean, tidy, quiet and great for swimming. Highly recommended.",
          "I just don't get the positive reviews - the beach was dirty - not covered everywhere in plastic but way dirtier than anything you would see in Europe or Australia. And you only have to walk a little way to see all the huge developments being planned which are going to ruin this",
          "We actually visited the private section for the Lantana Boutique Hotel but all of the beach looked similar. Permanent umbrellas and sun lounges, wandering waiters to get you food or cold drinks and clean sand, warm clean water with gentle swells. Whats not to love! Visited 3",
          "I've been here several times recently with 12 year old daughter. Best to come in the morning as the wind often gets up in the arvo. Beach is cool, cruisey and clean. Plenty of cafes, restaurants, deck chairs, and shade. If you arrive by taxi, no worries as there's always taxis",
          "We headed here after having a free morning. The taxi cost 60k, and was approximately 10 mins from the old quarter. Very easy to find the beach is Busy yet you can laze about under an umbrella with drink service everywhere. The swimming area is marked out so as boats and jet",
          "Underrated and very clean beach. Albeit not as impressive, but a good enough beach just to relax, have a beer, sun tan and then head up for a good seafood lunch thereafter. Had a good time there! Also be aware of some locals scamming you to charge you for the use of the beach",
          "Great location. Plenty of water sport options. Loads of small shops. Cycling distance from hoian, you will be charged to park at the many bike parks but it\u2019s generally minimal. Less than 75p The restaurants lining the entrance to the beach were busy. Would definitely recommend",
          "To be honest, a very average beach in my opinion. However, it is a good place to relax and offers watersports if that's your thing. Super hot in August \ud83e\udd75",
          "The beaces here are fairky clean the restaurants nearby orpbably detract the ambiance of the olace. But its nice to swim in and deoending in time or day not too busy.",
          "By chance we took the Little Hoian bus from our hotel to An Bang beach. A half of the beach is occupied by the people who do the commercial things (parasailing, place for hiring,...). The bar service is very nice!",
          "Ang Bang Beach was fine,Under no circumstanses try the parasiling unless you want injury and enjoy pain.Looks like fun but its a nightmare.You have been warned.",
          "I went to this beach on a sunny day in August. The water was super warm. They had a water trampoline to use that was a good time. Be prepared to have vendors harass you while you try to relax. It is worth renting a lounger.",
          "Nice beach had clear water and marked off sections for swimming and had jet skiing and other water activities would recommend",
          "We visited the beach in the morning, and spent around 4 hours there. Before sitting down at any table/banana lounge it is highly recommended that you speak with the restaurant/resort that owns it. Typically these will have a minimum spend to use them. The beach side lounges",
          "We experienced quite a few traders here, one or two of whom weren't always happy to be told \"no thank you.\" BUT you can't fault the beach itself and the water was lovely and warm. Felt more than safe leaving our valuables on the sun lounger, which itself didn't cost much at",
          "Having read reviews of An Bang beach I had braced myself for it being a case of constant hassle from beach traders and picking my way through crowds of noisy young folk. Rest assured, however, that isn't the case. At least, it wasn't if you pick your spot well. Our hotel dropped",
          "Requires a look to get idea of area. Possibly more suitable for younger age group as there are ample eating and drinking areas overlooking beach. During late afternoon, it is too crowded",
          "A lot of holiday accommodation provide free sun beds with sun shades at the beach. The Salt pub offers free wifi and has good food choices. Very relaxing.",
          "When you go to the beach on motorbike they will try overcharge you for parking (50,000) at the main entrance. If you refuse to pay they will quickly lower the price! To avoid this park up a few meters before you hit the beach, there are ladies with space outside their",
          "Quick, ten minute trip from Hoi An by taxi..around 100000 Dong..beach is filled with sun lounges and eating venues, and very relaxing atmosphere. The water was very refreshing and a great spot away from the hustle of city centre..worth a few hours visit. Plenty of food and drink",
          "They've paved paradise. The beach was fetid and very crowded. We spent an hour there before getting out of dodge. I recall this beach in 2003 and it was stunning. It's a shame really.",
          "Our hotel provide a free shuttle to the beach. It\u2019s available in the morning and in the afternoon. We went to this beach twice in our stay in Hoi An. The beach is clean and umbrellas and chairs provided. You can purchase food and drinks. You can just relax, swim or hire a jets",
          "Beach that is beautiful with loungers along with sunshades for rent. Tremendous lots of sand for kids to play in and appealing water with waves which are yummy. Tons of preference on the place you are able to consume with awesome food all around. Several places in fact had beach",
          "A nice enough beach and relatively litter free, but very crowded and lots of stuff scattered around (tires for floating/vendors/never ending rows of beach chairs). Chairs should cost 50k, but it doesn't mean they won't try to sucker people into 100k. It's really not expensive",
          "We had a most enjoyable day at An Bang Beach. Water clean, safe, warm etc. Didn\u2019t think we would stay as long as we did. My daughters had a go at the Parrsailing and jet skis which was reasonably priced. The sand gets very hot so you need thongs or shoes to get to the waters",
          "Stayed on An Bang for a week at the end of June/late July. It was averaging 37-42 degrees each day, it was super hot. While we had a pool where we stayed it wasn\u2019t incredibly refreshing so we gave the beach a try. Because it was so hot in the middle of the day (especially",

          "I think this might be my favourite beach. We stayed at the less busy end (further away from Da Nang). The beach always felt pretty empty despite it being August and it was really clean. The sea was warm and shallow for a long way out. It felt safe for my children aged 12, 10 and",
          "Lots of bars great place to relax by the sea side and put up your feet and enjoy a few drinks and have a meal",
          "We love hanging around An Bang Beach. The vibe is very relaxing. The waters very refreshing and clean. It doesn\u2019t get overcrowded too. There are also a number of good restaurants lining the beach serving great food at very reasonable prices. Anyone visiting Hoi An should not",

          "We enjoyed a couple of great days on this beach. The water is warm with enough waves for enjoyment. There are water sports, paragliding, banana boats, jet skis etc. There are plenty of sun beds and refreshments available. Also there are many cafes selling local food. Beware of",
          "Sadly the Vietnam government need to address the rubbish and pollution problems. Not just at the beach everywhere we went there was dumping of plastic bags full of rubbish. It\u2019s so sad to see.",
          "Beach that is beautiful to relax! You are going to find scores of seats and beds for \" rent\". Nearly all places let you use the beds for \"free\" together with the state you have lunch in the restaurant of theirs, which is usually discovered behind the seating. Hardly any hawkers",
          "Can get a little full during lunch time but t really nice. Don\u2019t stay too long or in he sun without applying constant sunscreen because you will burn easily. Suggest going early in the morning like 7-8 ish",
          "Totally worth a visit. Spent the afternoon and watch the sun set, beautiful. Food at the fish man cafe was amazing",

          "An Bang beach serves as respite from the hustle of Hoi An town with some decent eateries on the beach stretching up the coast. However, the beach itself is not pretty and the sea is almost always merky. A worthwhile visit but don\u2019t expect Phu Quoc Quality here.",
          "Money for chairs but free if you pay for overpriced food ... for whole family. Selling flags, bracelets, hats, sunglasses, banana rides. Tap you on shoulder if you are asleep. Looks like it is organised by couple of mafia types who respond to seller texts. Worst of vietnam.",
          "We visited this beach a few times, and had a great time there. My son decided to give the parasailing behind a boat activity a go, and thoroughly enjoyed this 1st time adrenaline rush. Clean beach, clean water, lots of restaurants for drinks and food.",

          "The beach itself was a lot nicer than I expected. The water was warm and the currents weren\u2019t insane. The beach chairs were nice because you could sit in the shade or move them out in the sun (50.000VND/person). It got pretty crowded near sunset time but I didn\u2019t feel crammed",
          "We spent half a day here relaxing, having a drink at one of the beach front restaurants & walking along the sand. There are plenty of deck chairs out of the sun or just take your beach towel & relax on the sand. There is a life guard on duty also",
          "One of the best beach I have been in Asia. An Bang offers a lot of seafood. Me and my wife had a chance to try crab and some oyster here. However, the beach is a little bit dirty because of trash. After we finished eating, the shuttle bus took us back to the hotel in the old",

          "We had great fun here yesterday but please be wary of a scam happening here and elsewhere in Hoi An. You will be asked to fill in a tourism survey and then the next morning you will be phoned early in the morning to be told you have won a $2500 voucher from Odyssey Resort",
          "An Bang beach is nice enough, although I was expecting something more picturesque given the description in Lonely Planet. We cycled from Hoi An, which is pleasant once you\u2019re out of central Hoi An (there\u2019s a cycle lane of sorts). What was very irritating was that we were stopped",
          "Nice and clean beach. Not much vendors to hassle you. Very irritating beach restaurant hasslers tho.",
          "So many choices for restaurants. Sol Kitchen was amazing food and service but all the restaurants are great. Very friendly local people. I needed a pharmacy whilst I was there and a local lady took me on her pushbike so I did not have to walk. Amazing place to spend time.",
          "This is the best beach in the Hoi An area. It is surrounded by wonderful homestays and boutique hotels, rather than large resorts. There are several good restaurants along the beach that serve good food and great cocktails. My favorite thing to do when staying here is watch",
          "We stayed nearby at the beautiful An Bang seaside village (The Boathouse). The beach is stunning - clean, soft sand, gentle slope into the water, no big waves (very safe for small children), water sports, and sun beds to rent for 50,000 vnd (c. \u20ac2). Our daughters did some",
          "Worth a visit for the afternoon. We aren't really beach people but it's a good change from the Old Town and the breeze ( if there is any) off the water keeps the temperatures down a bit. About 70k in a metered taxi from the old town or a relatively easy bike ride through the",
          "White sand & clear water make for a great day at the beach. Very hot day but we\u2019re provided with beach umbrella & sun bed at no charge. Service great for food & cold beer. Golden Pearl provided the transport to & from beach part of their service.",
          "Fantastic beach with water sports cafes with bars and wonderful warm ocean to cool off in. Eastern aspect affords awesome sun rises with the sun coming up majestically from behind the Cham islands. Watch out for the beach front restaurants as they are quite pricey and the food",
          "Make sure you say free sun bed if you stay for lunch, as some will make you pay even if you have lunch .",
          "The old town of Hoi An is a must ! With the riverside dinning and lanterns it is an amazing place to visit along with the night markets snd little laneways with many cafes/restaurants snd the Japanese bridge and fresh food markets we had a great time visiting the old town of Hoi",
          "We love An Bang beach. We have been to Hoi An a number of times. Our spiritual visit stayed once we've been to An Bang beach. The eateries along to top of the dune all have slightly different menus. The grilled scallops are a favourite. The seafood dishes are all fresh and",
          "Love An Bang Beach,beautiful coastline were the mountains touch the sea,tropical waters brilliant sunshine,lovely restaurant and water activities a great place to cool off on a hot day.",
          "Lovely clean beach. Water was a fabulous temperature, refreshing without being too cold. Services such as taxi, food etc no problem.",
          "The beach is clean, the water is perfect for a swim. Lots of caf\u00e9s and sunbeds. Also a lot of restaurants and smallere shops nearby",

          "Stayed here a few hours one afternoon and really enjoyed it. Some nice restaurants and if you would like there is parasailing offered.",
          "I found this beach just ok. Although they provided lounges etc, it was nice to lounge, the swimming was not great. The water did not feel clean and refreshing to me. Not a great atmosphere either. To be fair, there were water activities that you could do if you were inclined to",
          "Big beach with lots of places to sit in shade and eat. Fun waves, but beach is dirty - watch for broken glass. I also stepped on a needle..! Probably an isolated incident. Evenings the locals crowd in - fun to watch another take on beach life. Check it out",
          "We spent a couple of days here. You can jet ski etc or just walk, swim and relax. Lots of choices of beachside restaurants.",
          "One of the Best beaches in Vietnam. If you want activity you have all option for this Great places to eat #laplage",
          "Nice beach, not stunning. Nicely set up beach chairs with umbrellas which you don\u2019t pay for if you eat there. Food was average at best. Cheap drinks and relaxing views. Water is salty and cooler than hotel pool so refreshing. Was alright but nothing to rave about.",
          "Just a minutes walk from our resort and a welcome into the shade and cool even from those who speak no English. Vietnamese coffee was our favourite on a hot day but they made a good cappuccino as well. Find a cool spot inside, beside a fish pond, in a garden nook or overlooking",
          "We went to An Bang Beach for the day, lovely beach very clean & not to busy the beds cost about a \u00a31 for the day. The sea was really warm & a great place to cool down from the heat.",
          "We were in Hoi An for 6 days and got to this beach on 4 of those days. Decent beach for swimming & sunbathing with lots of bars/restaurants to drop into",

          "Our hotel, Phu Thinh Resort had a shuttle bus that took us to this beach. It was great. The water was warm, clean and clear. The sand was very hot so we needed to leave our sandals on until we got to the water! You are able to get food and drinks at a reasonable price. We will",
          "Staying near here we spent a day chilling at the beach after 8 days of traveling. We were knackered. An bang is where people seem to go for the sun, sea and sand experience. Water sports are available here and sun beds come at a small fee unless you are eating at a restaurant.",
          "Quiet and nice beach if you go a little away from the centre of it. The waves are easy in the morning and picks a little up in the afternoon, still easy and good for cooling down in the heat. Only negative is that boats and jetski with tourists are too close to the beach. So",
          "We went here yesterday and what a great find. We caught the shuttle bus from our hotel. We has a great cabana to sit under. The beach was clean and beautiful. Water was warm but not hot like the pool has been. We did find some pockets of cold which was refreshing. Just wear",
          "We rode from our resort and left all our money at home so we it didn\u2019t get it stolen. Locals wouldn\u2019t let us leave the bikes unless we paid them at one beach and then another only if we bought food. We rode 10 km in the heat and were refused to even swim. We spent a lot of money",
          "Typical of many southern-Asian shores: a few spots look quite nice, and there they try to charge you for any little thing, like attaching your rental bicycle, and if you don\u2019t comply instantaneously, there comes someone with a whistle to tell you to move on. Instead of annoying",
          "What a great beach! Water is warm and inviting with a gradual slope but no waves for surfing. Sand is clean which is pleasant. Open restaurants line the beach which give you the option to purchase drinks or stop in for something to eat however these are not cheap compared to",
          "Visited one morning while staying in Hoi An. Taxi was quick, sat on deck chairs. The sand was so hot it burnt your feet,. Wore sandals to the waters edge second swim. They had paragliding. Nice beach would love to return one day and explore the area more without the 39degrees",
          "Went past for a look with my family on our bikes and before we got too close a man stupid in the middle of the road and stopped us saying that bikes were not allowed and we had to pay him to park them there. We told him no and rode on. There were closer places you could pay to",
          "An Bang Beach is a particular favourite with the locals but they never arrive until sunset. During the days it is mainly the domain of sun baking foreigners but never too many. It also has a plethora of great seafood restaurants along it frontage. I never struck a dud one in the",
          "You can sit on the beach doing nothing but take in the atmosphere. If you like set yourself up at one of the local beach restaurants with the beach umbrella and lounges and get service with a smile, the water was beautiful and clear and not cold. If you want activities then para",
          "Not sure what the fusd about this beach is as it's just a beach. Things get a bit interesting after 3pm as stalls are set up on the beach with people selling food. I tried the pineapple with salt and chilli and it was certainly a different but enjoyable taste. Will be back but",
          "I first stayed at An Bang beach in September 2017. For 30 days I would wake at 5am and walk 80 metres to the beach where I would walk, watch the sun rise then swim. If you visit you must be on the beach to watch the sun rise and join the 100\u2019s of local people that go down to",
          "Must see stop whilst in Hoi An! There are deck chairs and umbrellas for use free of charge. Restaurants to dine at as well as order drinks by the beach side.",
          "Clean beach, clean bathrooms, clean restaurants and easy access. Would have gotten 5 stars but they really need to do something about the sales people on the beach selling bracelets they are extremly rude and aggressive and so e even sleep in the sunloungers intended for the",
          "Since last visiting this beach area in 2013 the change has been enormous. Development has run riot and the infrastructure has not kept pace. At first sight the beach area looks inviting. Look a little closer and you confronted with plentiful rubbish and debris from the adjacent",
          "This beach surprised me. I guess I was expecting to be harassed on the beach as has been my experience on several beaches in Thailand but that isn't the case. Relaxing and a great family beach. Lots of activities on offer if you chose but no one is harassing you. You can also",
          "This beach is ok. No tthe cleanest, there are Hawkers selling their wares, but will leave you alone eventually. Check prices of the beds if you want to rent them as they differ. SOme offer a shower also where some dont. The water is very pleasant, dont expect blue sea but its",
          "The beach is fantastic! The water sport options are terrific. Food options are great. A perfect day :)",
          "Crowded dirty and noisy...the worst side of Hoi An, now the once delightful beach is blotted out by straw umbrellas and recliners...'Hidden Beach', further down towards Hoi An much nicer.much cleaner and quieter!",

          "Had a lovely day at An Bang Beach. Lunch at the wonderful The Deck Beach restaurant. Free shuttle from and to our accommodation. In hindsight, would have loved spending a couple of days at this house beach of magical Hoi An.",
          "We liked the beach. Its close to Hoi an and we had a lovely day. It was not overcrowed. The sea was very nice and warm",
          "Very nice beach with many restaurant. Sea food. Coconut. Good place to take a rest. Highly recomment",
          "We stayed just in a villa just behind main beach strip, it\u2019s a beautiful place with beautiful hard working gentle people. It is easy to relax and enjoy yourself here. The beach is a haven for locals and foreign visitors alike and is crowded particularly from late afternoon on.",
          "We walked along from the ship pub to the shore club and apart from in front of the many restaurants there was so much rubbish! Could be a good beach if only it were kept clean!",
          "We missed visiting our last trip to Vietnam. It\u2019s a serene place. I was expecting a lot of rubbish and tourists but the place was anything but. The locals keep this beach in pristine condition and not many tourist during the middle of the day, which was highly unexpected. One",
          "A 20 minute cycle from Hoi An. Crystal clear and cool. Very clean beach. The beach beds were very pricey - hence the downgrade from 5 star. I cycled here in 20 minutes",
          "This beach is kind of ruined by the number of sellers on it. You are bombarded by men trying to sell you a sunbed for 150k for the day etc. If you want a bed just refuse the price and walk away as they will eventually give you the bed for 30-50k or even if you buy a beer from",
          "the moment i rode up to this crowded beach entrance i was alerted that i had arrived at scam central! parking a motorbike in Danang is usually free and at the most 5000 dong. here they imediately demanded 20000 dong. the beach chairs were shoddy and they wanted 8 us dollars",
          "Just been to My Khe public beach and Non Nuoc beach along the 5-star resorts in Da Nang (main city area) just a day before visiting this beach, and had great expectations for this famous An Bang beach at Hoi An. Sadly, my dreams of an even better beach was shattered. Assessment",
          "We went out to An Bang beach by taxi only to find it incredibly nice. The water is clear and not dangerous. We hanged out at Salt Pub where banana chairs were for free and spent all afternoon on a number of occasions. Great spot for swimming. They have hotels and home stayed by",
          "Clean and not too crowded; close by restaurants Great beach to relax, swim and soak in the sun Highly recommend to visit this beach if you are in Hoi An area",
          "Hmm...this is a difficult one. The beach seems pretty clean and the sea is glorious, shallow, transparent and the perfect temperature for cooling off. I would advise to just stay in the sea!!! The touts all started off friendly and polite, but they are relentless, at one point",
          "I go here often there is something for everyone at this beach. Water clean, a great place to exercise early in the morning. Many Restaurants both Local and Foreign foods. A very friendly Beach. Great for Children, very safe!",
          "Beautiful beach- clear, clean, warm water, very safe for swimming, no jellyfish. The sand was also clean and soft! If you want a beach chair for the day under the shade, you are typically paying $2 USD. It's worth it, as June in Hoi An is incredibly hot and sunny. Lots of",
          "Very nice beach, but they take advantage of tourists. Further down is much nicer and quieter beaches, with same ambiance, just lot more bang for your buck.",
          "Take the time to stroll away from the main area-5-10 minutes in either direction and the crowds will disappear. 10,000 vnd to park your bicycle the same to use the bathroom if not eating at the cafes. The beach is clean, not much hassle and an easy bike ride from the old town.",
          "Seriously in love with this place.. don\u2019t be put off by some of the puzzling negative comments. Yes there are a few bits of construction and some eye sores behind the restaurants where the local workers do their thing but it\u2019s not in view of the gorgeous beach. We were there in",
          "The beach was clean and the water beautiful. Restaurants line the beach and you can use sunbeds if you purchase a drink or food. (some people think this is a rort but realistically you can lay on the sand with no shade if you don't want the bed) We were staying at one of the",

          "If you want to stay away from crowd, you should go to An Bang beach. The water is clear and the sand is perfect. There are lots of hotel and small resort nearby that can provide you a perfect retreat.",
          "The beach is flooded with tourists and many small business trying to make money. We found it far more relaxing at our hotel pool.",
          "Stayed here for whole day each time I came in Hoian. Was a quiet beach with beautiful and warm water",

          "We were pleasantly surprised with our recent day trip to An Bang beach. Our Hoi An hotel provided a shuttle service to the beach where we could use shaded beach lounges and restaurant facilities. The beach was relatively quiet compared to Hoi An, and the outlook is beautiful!",
          "The sand is fine and white and gently shelves at the seas edge; but the backdrop is derelict building sites and the beach has building debris and lots of litter, discarded and derived from jetsom Much tidier in front of the private resort hotels\u2019 frontages",
          "Our hotel had a shuttle bus to the beach and sun beds provided. This was a lovely beach that seemed to carry on forever in both directions. The water was clean and the views were great. There were a few people trying to sell you stuff but not too many so it wasn\u2019t annoying.",
          "Great clean beach, really quiet when we visited in June. Umbrellas and sun beds available. Sea beautiful, warm and clear. Definitely worth a visit",
          "We loved this sandy beach. Water was clean with a sandy bottom well out to sea. Cooling breezes help in the heat of summer. We stayed at the Soul Club which provided lounges and covered settings. Good coffee, affordable drinks and good lunch choices.",
          "The beach is ideal for those who are wanting to have a refreshing swim. The beach has many restaurants and cafes to choose from. If you want to sit under an umbrella you are expected to buy a drink at least from the restaurant that provides the much needed shade. The pedlars",

          "Visited An Bang during the past 3 weeks, and while it was a beach with Palm trees and some restaurants, it is still is still just a beach. Power boats, Jetskis, buzzing around tear into any relaxing mind set and the touts and beach sellers make it less than idyllic. Beer is",
          "This beach is great for an afternoon dip or a session of sunbathing. Lots of restaurants and bars along the shore for drinks and food. Can get busy in the late afternoon/evening but still recommended. Doesn\u2019t have the softest of sand and can have some litter but that aside the",

          "Visited with my adult daughter. Hotel provided shuttle to An Bahn beach. Comfortable beds plenty of shade and service on the beach from the Deckhouse if you like but we preferred to sit in and get some respite from the sun. Most relaxing part of our hectic tour around Vietnam",
          "Very nice beach with a constant strong breeze off the South China Sea. Visited for three weeks in February. Not too busy when I was there. Lots of eating places along the beach. Some very reasonably priced and others not so much. Many cheaper restaurants away from the",
          "Pleasantly suprised and enjoyed but did not like the the people selling us things on the beach, they hassled us when we declined to buy things. Great restaurant with good food and drinks. Beach clean and tidy. Loved the umbrellas and loungers to enjoy the beach.",

          "Beach is nice and sandy. You can rent chairs for approximately 20k Dong. If you buy drinks the chairs will be for free. During our stay it was quite windy which was nice because it was so hot. If you visit the beach make sure to go to the far left end to escape mass tourism and",

          "If you come from a country that has lots of very beautiful beaches like Australia, you need to manage your expectations as it is not up to that standard in my opinion. That said, we had a lovely day, relaxing on beach chairs and then lunch in one of the many seaside restaurants.",
          "An bang beach is still beautiful with an abundance of beach chairs and restaurants but we miss the relaxed villagy feel of years gone by. If you desire peace and quiet head south to other little beach access lanes and you will be quietly surprised with what you can find......",

          "Made an oversight of obtaining a lounge chair close to the entry, which we've to spend 100,000 vnd for. In case you bring your very own mat and do not love a shelter, you are able to sit anyway actually. Or maybe walk downwards to the right of yours where chair rentals are going",

          "Was slightly apprehensive as didnt know what to expect, turned right at the entrance and started walking along the hot sand to be met by an onslaught, people wanting you to sit on their part of the beach, all free. Settled for one after checking the definition of free, this",

          "Don't park next to the whistle warden! \n\nJust before the seafront you will be approached by the \"security\" blowing a whistle in your face and then he will start tapping you with his stick. He's a next level jobsworth who lets the locals \u2026",

(Take the grab!)\n\nLots of restaurants to choose from serving local dishes and fish/seafood with the occasional bar.\n\nYou can spend a whole day here.",
          "Overrated beach to be honest. It is famous because it's close to Hoi An I guess. There are more beautiful beaches in Vietnam which are worth your time and money.",
          "Water was great, big waves, lots of fun.",
          "Very Crowded on Sunday night this week probably because of wesak holiday. Full house on the beach!. It has become a giant picnic ground.... With food and drinks on the beach \n\nUnfortunately beer cans are plenty and smoking by some spoils the atmosphere. I hope that the beach is cleaned by the local authorities after the holidays",
          "Relaxed, not so clean beach\nWish authorities would kept it cleaner",

          "Not as beautiful as the photos. There are also quite a few ladies who sell local goods which are nice to look at at first and after buying a few of them, you don't really want to see more. Otherwise, the sea is lovely to swim in and ample space to lie in the shade.",

          "Fresh relaxing wonderful seafood",
          "Worst beach even, the water sport and speed boats emit so much emission and pollution. We were expecting fresh air by the sea,  certainly disgusted by the amount of polluted air,  it caused me lung infection, would never come back here again. This beach is not clean neither.",
          "Great beach. Big stormy when I was there.",
          "We have read and heard that it is a beach, where not many people hang around, so it will be an mostly unspoiled beach. But when we arrived here, shock was the feeling in our faces, got a bit better when we reach our home for the next couple \u2026",
          "Nice beach but it could be cleaner - but of a tourist hotspot so visit in quieter hours such as after sunset to experience local atmosphere! Sea is generally clean but bit of plastic which spoils it slightly which is a shame - lots of seafood restaurants and places to get a drink",
          "personally this beach was way better than My che beach in Da nang!",
          "It's a nice beach, lots of seafood restaurants. You can use the sun loungers at all of the places as long as you buy a drink. The usual sellers on the beach selling bracelets etc, you can jetski etc there. Taxi from old town was 75,000vhd",

          "Clean beaches. Good wave. Nice place.",
          "Nice beach, just a shame all the vendors there are very rude and pushy. They try to extort money out of you for no reason. Even just cycling to the beach some idiots stand in front of you and nearly push you off as apparently this is a way \u2026",

          "Nice Beach, plenty of restaurants to choose from. I ordered grilled oyster and Saigon beer reasonable price decent service",

          "Beautiful beach, alot local cafes and restaurant for food and drink",
          "As a lover of beaches ( particularly being from Australia) this one was just beautiful! We were lucky and got amazing weather. Not sure if it's good for surfing ( probably not actually) but definitely great for a swim and a laze about with a beer. Shaded seats are free if you buy a cocktail.",
          "The beach itself is nice and clean. But locals go around you trying to sell everything. This place is expensive- sunbed 4 Eur / 2 hours. No shower even for feet.",
          "Great beach, too many tourists, take at least 20.000d if you want to park your motorbike",
          "Really liked this beach but turned up a little late as the sun was setting behind the palms therefore not leaving us much sunbathing time! Not too many people so found space  comfortably and seemed to be plenty of sunbeds available. All of the bars/restaurants on the front all looked good. Wished we had time to revisit and enjoy!",
          "Yes the beach is clean but it's not really that great. It's crowded. And there are better beaches in vietnam. Only thing i liked was the street food. We also went to shore club. It was good place to chill",
          "Amazing beach to have a chill watching the waves.",
          "Very clean a d enjoyable beach. If you ignore the people trying to get you to their spot and just find a place with out beach beds you will have a god time. There is a lot of wildlife in the form of little crabs and tiny fish so go looking \u2026",
          "Seafood dinner by the beach, feels like home",
          "Free beach. Definitely enjoyed my time lazing around. You can pay to rent a seat or bring your own towel so you have something to sit on.",
          "Sandy beach, relatively clean with safeguard on duty. I didn't try to order meal or bevverages there.",
          "Great beach, very quiet. We went in December and weather was good but rainy. Still the shacks at the beach are pretty good. If you enjoy time away from busy crowd then you must come here.",
          "Nice calm beach... The restaurants are very overpriced and staff is only thinking of profit. Very little sand area, but the water is nice to swim.",
          "Beautiful beach and worth visiting, though it is quite crowded in the evening. Its easy to get there from Hoi An city by using grab.",
          "A warm and surprisingly nice beach for Vietnam. Try to avoid the main entrance area for hanging out as it's a circus.",
          "Nice clean beach not to much crowded. You get a beach couch for about 100k a day.",
          "Great beach with soft sand. You can even see the white buddha statue from here",

          "Beach is nice and clean, water is almost too warm! The people bugging you to pay for lounge chairs, parasailing, or to buy their Knick-knacks is a bit annoying but very much not surprising.",
          "Lovely little beach, you can use the sun beds of you buy drinks from the resturant behind. The only grumble we had was we were being moved on by locals at 3.30 as they were setting up their stalls around you for the evening, while you were sunbathing but we understand that is their living.",
          "A lot of trashes along the Beach. Doesnt look good for me.",
          "Great beautiful beach! Clean and safe. Close to the centre of the city\nHighly recommended for every traveler in Hoian Vietnam",
          "Had a great time at this beach. The restaurants are good and friendly, they offer you beach benches provided you order something from them. Washroom and changing rooms are nearby, and they are in good condition. Highly recommended especially if you go with family.",
          "Leng spot, bit touristy but not over priced as you\u2019d expect. Grab a donut, they\u2019re the shiznit. Would be nicer if less overcrowded but y\u2019know bro.",
          "Lovely beach. On hot days, it is crowded but order. The sand is beautiful, water is clear and warm.\nRecommended...",
          "We stayed in Hoi An for 3 nights and 4 days and we ended up visiting the beach twice! Although the beach was filled with tourist, it was nice! It didn\u2019t feel empty and it wasn\u2019t overcrowded (we went near the end of February). It cost \u2026",
          "It's almost February and the beach is not too busy but not so empty that it feels abandoned.  Get there early for a good spot, bring your own snacks if you don't like paying for resort prices.  Otherwise nice relaxing beach with the occasional bus of tourists.",
          "Nice beach, parked the bikes for 20 dong each and got 2 sunbeds for 80 dong.",
          "The beach itself is kinda small, but okay. There's some good spots for drinks/food and generally hanging out. If you are going to eat somewhere, you can just ignore the guys who want to make you pay for parking - just hurry straight past and park at your chosen restaurant instead \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb",
          "The locals try and sell you on a beach chair in exchange for lunch but fail to tell you that there is a minimum you have to order for lunch. Then they try to to make you pay by threatening to call the police. Go to another beach....",
          "A really nice beach. A shame it was a bit dirty, but maybe it was due to the high winds.",
          "Lovely beach. Move away, north, from the crowds and you'll find some wonderful women to serve cheap drinks with a free beach lounger. Avoid paying the bike parking fee by just driving past them. Its a classic vietnam cash grab, you can park your bike almost anywhere for free.",
          "Beautiful beach ! I love it. I also like some community projects around An Bang beach such as : Goby fish trash bin, sharing Box... It is so meaningful.",

          "White sand, clear, warm water...",
          "The beach was good, but the guy where we want to park our bicycles was a bit annoying. He asked for 50 k but we gave him 10 and walked away. Touristscam",
          "Worth a visit if you\u2019re nearby, but it\u2019s my least favourite part of Hoi An. To me it seems like a  seedy beach-side bar area with an average beach. Not my thing, but I\u2019m glad I made a quick visit.",
          "Cool\ud83d\ude18",
          "Lovely beach with lots of water sports, restaurants and cafes with good seafood. I especially recommend Dolfin - family run place, service might be a bit slow but food is worth it! \nIf you eat at any restaurant you can usually get a sunbed and umbrella for free.",
          "Lovely soft sand and pretty clean water. Was very windy so the sand was getting everywhere including my eyes. Waves can be a bit big but is fun if you can swim well.",
          "Very nice beach :)))))",
          "Nice beach in hoi an",
          "Rated top 10 most beautiful beach in the world. Soft sandy beach, waves that are surfable certain times of the year.\n\nMust at least drop by if you are in Danang or Hoi An. Just 15mins ride from either directions.\n\nLots of beachside restaurants and bars.",

          "Nice little beach, have seen better sand elsewhere but didn't look bad. Lots of restaurants, be warned that you cannot sit by the ocean unless you are spending lots of money. Even if the restaurants are empty, you cannot sit sea-side unless you are ordering food and drinks.",
          "Ok",
          "Having a nice weekend on  An Bang beach. \nLove the fresh air here and local ppl.",
          "The beach is amazing but there is 2 things that I didn't like, especially 1 is consider hate.\nWhich is\n1) a lot of very aggressive souvenirs seller keep coming and want you to buy things while you seating there having your relax time.\n2) \u2026",
          "Nice beach tell the sun bed owners you want to buy drink/food will the sun beds be free ? If not expect to pay 50000 dong for the whole day",
          "Busy tourist beach. It's nice, and beautiful in the way of beaches,  bu the jet skis flying along the shallow water is a bit dangerous, the sand is crazy hot, and there's a stupid amount of people. I would talend walking 1km down the beach to where its quiet.",
          "Brief visit to say we have seen it. Crowded with people and wall to wall sunbeds. May well have been more peaceful further along the beach but back to the hotel pool for me",
          "Fresh coconut was cold and good , coconut coffee was not very cold",
          "Sand is clean and fine. The waves here are strong enough to make some splashes and doesn't get too deep quickly. Perfect for a break from visiting Hoi An, possible to cycle there.",
          "Definitely a must visit when you are in Hoi An or even Da Nang. There are shacks by the beach and restaurant therefore no need to worry about shades or that growling tummy. If you eat at the restaurant, then the shades are FOC.\nAs for the \u2026",
          "Great day but watch your change when buying food. Tried to take 500000 for 50 first time and then no change from 200000 for a beer",
          "Great beach. Try to go very early in the morning. The sun burn too much",
          "Its just okay. The view from the beach is boring. Its very quiet (at least in late January it was).  There's many restaurants right on the beach to choose from.  Walk further down the beach to find ones with more reasonable prices than the \u2026",
          "Nice beach. Sunbed use a bit pricier than used to on Vietnam coast.  Sea good with gentle surf and slope out some distance.  Water sports too close to shore / swimming.",

          "Ok",
          "One of the highlights of my Vietnam trip. It's a beautiful beach bustling with activities. I went parasailing here and the experience was awesome! There are a number of other rides that one can opt for, like jet ski rides, banana rides, etc.",
          "Beach was relaxing had activities during the day and night even street food on the beach. The only negative thing the rubbish left around.",
          "If you get the chance, go for the sunrise! It starts early but it's only locals and you can find a seat easy. Nothing like swimming during a pollution free sunrise in warm water that let's you float easily from the salinity! Basically heaven, you'll forget how tired you were and beat the heavy evening crowds",
          "Beautiful long sandy beach with lounge chairs and many choices for lunch along the shore.; chose a vegan spot today,  but have to say I prefer vietnamese! The locals say it is too cold to swim but the water was very warm by Canadian standards.  Many of the restaurants have foot showers!",

          "Fine beach, cheap prices for food and hammocks there. Very wavy",
          "Pretty fun, don't bet the people on the beach to buy you stuff and bring it back, they try to sting you. Either get your own, or make sure you get a price off them",

          "Visit early and see the locals exercising before going to work.",
          "The beach is beautiful but my experience was ruined by all the people doing business there. One guy approached and invited me to use their chairs. He said: \u201cIf you have lunch at the restaurant, you are free to seat there. But if you sit at \u2026",
          "It is atmosphere,",

          "Probably a beautiful beach. You can bike from Hoi An easily. Never got to it though as we were asked to stop and pay to park the bicycles. We didn\u2019t want to pay (which you have to), so we just left. \n\nThat payment seems like grossly \u2026",
          "Free sun beds for a beer get a towel for a Dollar from the restaurant owner, some places even have a shower you can use. Happy days.",

          "Quite nice, very relaxing,\n\nLoads of food shops to choose from with fresh seafood, you get to choose your seafood here.\n\nWater is warm too.",
          "Not too crowded, that's a good thing. And good restaurants nearby. But water is not turquoise and it is as hot as the air outside. Good for a half-day plan I'd say",
          "Park the bike, rent a deckchair and enjoy the beach. Nice food and drinks close by!",
          "Only 3 km away from the city center. You will pass by the vegetable village. Not so famous but a must to do if you want to swim in the  sea.",
          "This is a really nice beach to visits.  What make this beach very nice than other beach I went is not much big building hotels at the side of the beach so the beauty still remain there and also the people here is very nice in hoi an.  If \u2026",

          "Not all its made out to be the beach further down is quieter. If you do go here though visit rustic bar and restaurant. Great prices, great host, great bar. If it wasn't for this bar I would be giving a one star review.",
          "Nice beach. Loungers owned by beach bars. You can get a lounger cheap. If you buy food/drinks places will give you the lounger for free. Prices about double what they are in town. You don't get hassled by anyone.",
          "Very nice beach. Most of the sun beds are free when you go to restaurant that owns them. Prices are not bad.",
          "I just came for the seafood, which was awesome but a tad greasier and saltier than I'd like - but still awesome. As far as the beach goes, from a guy who doesn't care for beaches, it was nice. A bit crowded, which is to be expected, but the water was clean and the sand was soft.",
          "Quite touristy, lots of different nationalities. I didn't eat here as it was a little too full of tourists and would therefore cater differently.\nThe sea doesn't look great for kids but the sand is good and there was little litter in sight.",
          "Love this beach! Not very crowded with nice easy waves to swim in. You can get a chair&umbrella for very cheap that also have food&beverage service that is really good or simply lay out on a towel on your own. We were here for a week and loved it",
          "Nice beach, lots of good bars and restaurants along the back. Many have beach loungers out front and you can just walk up, grab one and get ordering. Very easy to get to, a lot of hotels in Hoi An have free bikes and it doesn\u2019t take too long to cycle over via the rice paddies.",
          "Quite nice, not so crowded even on weekends.",
          "This was the nicest of beaches we\u2019ve seen in Vietnam. Mui Ne was filthy! So that was a nice surprise to see a clean beach. I\u2019d give more stars if we weren\u2019t being harassed to buy something every three minutes. Also, being yelled at by the people out front to park your bike there was a bit much.",
          "V busy around 5-7pm but very nice view and good beach",
          "Great waves, exciting atmosphere...delicious food.",
          "Dirty and no worth even seeing it.",
          "Very relaxing for day time. A bit crowded in afternoon as many local but great time to relax",
          "Beautiful, well maintained beach just outside of Hoi An. There are beach chairs for rent, food is about 50% more than in town, and beer is very reasonable. Don\u2019t let the vendors try and over charge you for the chairs. They shouldn\u2019t be more \u2026",
          "Great beach, lots of food places to choose, bars and lovely atmosphere. Great sea food around.",
          "It was so beautiful here! Swimming in the warm ocean with the rain falling from the sky",
          "Chill and peaceful beach",
          "Shaded seats, friendly welcome, warm water, clean but cloudy prob due to sediment in (hot) sand. No worms!",
          "Wonderful place full of amazing people and great, cheap food!",
          "Total RIP-OFF. Never again on a Vietnamese beach,. All those uneducated parasites that try to steal your money (see other negative reviews), and even use a whistle to try to make you move on if you just want to look and don\u2019t want to park \u2026",
          "Great beach. Yellow sands, places to park your bike, traditional food stalls that serve tasty foods. Option of spread boatjng and other water sports.",
          "12th best beach in the world and it shows. Water very warm and a deserted beach.",
          "Long Sandy beach. Safe swimming. Lots of small cafe bars with free sunbeds. Would be 5 * if it was cleaned more regularly as some rubbish left lying. Don't let that put you off though as you can walk for miles.",
          "I didn't like this beach.",
          "We spent 6 hours in that beach. If u are in hoi an does not hesitate to go there by bicycle",
          "Very nice beach. The sea also....but is a place studied only for tourist, You will pay for everything. If you looking for a wild Vietnam sea, this is not the right place...if you want all comfort like resort structure, you can go.",
          "We visited at the start of May and the water was the perfect temperate. So refreshing after spending days wandering around in the old town hour and sweaty. The beach is basically filled with restaurants with beach chairs and umbrellas \u2026",
          "Nice beach. Good food options easily available.\n\nA few too many hawkers for me.",
          "Good place to swing by if you're on the way to Hoi An or on the way out to Danang. I wouldn't make this a must visit attraction as the beach is not as nice as the photos make out to be. Lots of locals come here and the beach was packed when \u2026",
          "Great wide sandy beach. Easy cycling distance from Hoi An. Bake in mind that they charge 10k for bike parking. There are some restaurants and beach chairs for rent, bu5 you can easily bring your own towel. Even in December the water was ok to swim. Some days the waves are too high though. Very nice chilled beach.",
          "Great before 11am or after 5pm - otherwise hot. Sadly, there's a direct correlation between lack of heat and how crowded it is, so you decide where your priorities lie.",
          "Nice beach, good local food outside of restaurants, safe",
          "Beach was nice, but had to pay for parking a scooter. The beach was very murky not crystal clear.",
          "Was clear and blue, I even made a giant crocodile, you can get a surf board there...\nThe beach area is too much touristy....\nMany locals trying to sell you stuff..\nTake money for parking.\nBut overall was nice!!\nThe waves are not good enough \u2026",
          "If you want to feel smell of people, visit here on the weekend.",
          "Head to the hidden Beach area, its very clean and relaxed. There are people offering loungers however you have to pay 50,000 dong for them. But if you order a drink from the restaurant then you will get a lounger with your drink.  Beach is good and the sea is very warm",
          "Lovely village, the villa we stay just 2 minutes walk to the beach. Have a super nice restaurant name Ladies May, her mother cook what we order and food are fab.",
          "Sunny beach to relax.many activities are possible.",
          "Beautiful beach, waves were a little rough though, hold onto your bikini! Delicious scallops in the moon restaurant, very cheap!",
          "It's just a beach. Water is nothing special. You can spend a couple of hours here if you want to chill out but I would not go here on purpose.",
          "Not a good surf but safe for an evening run or swim.",
          "This is a wonderful beach with soft sand and good swimming. There are plenty of restaurants and other places to eat and get a drink. When you arrive you will be hassled a lot by people wanting you to use their sun lounger, you can pay them \u2026",
          "Cool beach!",
          "Beauty place. Nice beach and sea - really cool surprise. Locals renting sun umbrella and sunbed + basic food and drink. If the beach will be cleaned from stuff from sea it will be better :)",
          "Nice beach. I like it",
          "Very nice beach, however very crowded with beach umbrellas and restaurants. It's good if you want a cocktail on the beach though!!",
          "Beautiful beach with beautiful sand and sea. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is everywhere is such a rip off! You have to pay for putting your bicycle somewhere, you have to pay to use rubbish sun beds and it is all incredibly \u2026",
          "We took bikes to go to the beach by the main road from Hoi An, as we were approaching the area, a man stopped us shouting: \"STOP STOP!!! Park here!\" We didn't want to stop just there as it was the first time and we couldn't even see the \u2026",
          "Meh. If you be been to Goa or other overcrowded commercialised sub tropical beaches then you know what I mean. Might be your thing but for me thanks but no thanks.",
          "Its a nice beach , U can spend some days here and enjoy The Walter, The beach and The Restaurants.\n\nI Just saw nicer beaches Thats why this one get only 4 Stars \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Beautiful beach, chairs are nice but have to be paid for. Water is warm and sand is soft.",
          "I didn't saw much crowd here but it was so perfect, clean.",
          "Beautiful clean beach. Stayed for several hours, lounging in chairs and swimming in the ocean. Had a few beers and spring rolls on the beach. Lounge chairs are not free use. Uncovered 25k. Covered 50k. But free if you order food. They still \u2026",
          "Fairly calm water, unfortunately not crystal clear like Phi Phi Islands. The water was warm but not too warm. Overall pleasant and relaxing. Jetskiis and parasailing non stop added to the fun and vibe. Beach was clean. As late afternoon \u2026",
          "This is a clean beach, in front of the restaurants, otherwise you\u2019ll find fishing nets, styrofoam and other nasties. The beach has lots of huts for drinks, which is nice, but is does get crowded. If you like secluded beaches with some room, don\u2019t come here. If you like to people watch and have no privacy, come one come all.",
          "Awful service, expensive food. Not good",
          "It's very touristy but you can get a sun lounger chair for the whole day for only 50,000 or bargain 80,000 for 2 people. The waves are quite big so it's not a good place for swimming but you can still go in the water and let the waves bash \u2026",
          "Nice but too much restaurant overthere.",
          "Very crowded and touristy beach. It\u2019s not too bad for a bit of sun and some restaurants are around it. But if you can skip it and go to Cua Dai, you don\u2019t regret it.",
          "The most amazing beach I have visited. Beautiful golden sand, pure clear water fantastic sunbeds and restaurant food drinks and cocktails brought to you from the Driftwood cafe at bargain prices!  It is also possible to hire jet skis and do paras ending here.",
          "Beautiful beach. Gets really really busy with local people around sunrise and sunset.",
          "Located about 15m drive from the centre of Hoi An.\nIt can be a little over crowded during the day but once the sun sets it quiets down. Surround by restaurants that overlook the beach. The beach was ok other than the rubbish which spoils \u2026",
          "Great for those seeking to go to the beach. Only the taxis there are all luxury taxi who charge very high fees just using the meter. A 20k dong ride ended costing 90k with the green taxis. Beware!",
          "Crowded with sun loungers but lovely white sand, beautiful cool water (April) and we found a lovely restaurant alongside beach.",
          "This is the beach to go to if you are visiting H\u1ed9i An. It is much cleaner and prettier than C\u1eeda \u0110\u1ea1i beach which is closer to the city. Less than two miles north, you can find this far superior beach. It also has many more amenities to choose from.",
          "Good beach, albeit with a noticable amount of trash and plastic. Most restaurants offer free sunbeds as long as you buy something for about 100K VND in total and the people working there is nice.",
          "Cute beach with nice views and reasonably priced food. A bit breezy in the afternoons. Pay 10,000 VND to park your bike on the main road.",
          "Great beech for family..  kid friendly. Swimming, para gliding, jet ski, etc... Food in area is really good, service is awesome and price is decent.  All in all a great place to spend a day.",
          "There are many hawkers and people touting on this beach which was a bit unpleasant. The beach is a bit dirty and was rather busy when I went. Without the foot traffic, rubbish and  locals hounding you to try their activities or use their beach beds  it would be a very nice place.",
          "A nice beach with lots of activities.",
          "Clean beach. Clear water. Good service at bars.",
          "Great beach with a lot of activities and restaurants/shops close to the beach. You can enjoy free beach chairs if you eat at their restaurant. Be prepared to pay for parking for your bicycle/scooter. Parking was 10k/bike but if you decided to buy water from their shop that would be the payment instead.",
          "A nice chill out beach. Lots of loungers and brollies. Great selection of lovely restaurants. Good prices too. Only downside is the hawkers pestering but that is the way here",
          "Ocean was warm and flat,clean beach where we were and lovely locals",
          "Definetely a place zu go when you are around  Hoi An... clean beach...I recommend going a little Bit south (near salt restaurant where you can take a sunbed for just one Drink) ... at the main Bang Beach it s Quite expensive to park and chill out (scammers!)",
          "Enjoyed our time at the beach, it's worth walking a little way from the 'main entrance' to the beach to find a quieter spot. Also if you are biking it down there are several bar/ restaurants that offer free parking if you buy a drink (water \u2026",
          "Chill, pleasant sand and not too crowded with people",
          "Very popular beach. Cafes very busy",
          "just ok. if you want great beaches you need to head south. the water isnt that warm unless its high summer and hawkers pester you all day long. nicer further down the coast",
          "Great place to chill and spend afternoon. Deckshairs with sunblockers only 100k VND per person (depending on bargaining skills).",
          "Surprised in a positive way about the beach. It's clean not to busy and have nice bambo huts, and big wooden embrellas. Food and drinks are OK priced. Sunbeds slisely overpriced 100 k pax. But if you move a 100 meter to the right near La Plage it's even cheaper and more nice 50k pax.",
          "Nice beach. Coming from a place with great beaches it wasn't much of a novelty.",
          "Great beach. Very safe. best to turn left when you get down onto the beach and walk 250 metres to where it's quieter. Loungers are free and there is plenty of good service.",
          "Not most beautiful beach in Vietnam but still worth a visit!",
          "For me it was a strong three stars. It looks good, but renting an umbrella and a sunbed is europian style. You can have it anywhere with better service. I\u2019d like to see long coastline with a few people. The restaurant was a little bit overpriced but not to much.",
          "locals here were very friendly great place to sit by the beach",
          "Great beach. Plenty of facilities, beds with umbrellas, food and drinks. Not possible to swim due to high waves and current.",
          "Worst beach in perhaps the whole world. Dirty, unorganized and with rude locals who are only after your money.",
          "I have been to many beaches and this one won't be my choice if I want to have the best time or chill my heart and soul completely. Simply because of the setting that is not my preferred in general. However, it still deserves great rating as \u2026",
          "Best Beach alot seafood restaurant",
          "Awesome to take a rest while laying on the sun bed.",
          "Tenderly. Relaxing place. Clean and clear beach.",
          "Warm water, fun waves, beautiful sand.",

          "\ud83d\ude01",
          "Nice beach. A bit busy during the day. I recommend going in the morning just to people watch. All the locals swim before work. Super interesting",
          "Warm water, beautiful and big enough to not be swamped by tourists.",
          "Beware of touts running out in the street in front of your bike to sell you parking. Wanted 10000vnd for two bikes when asked, changed to 10000vndx2 when we had parked and already handed over a bill to be exchanged.\n\nNot much money but \u2026",
          "A good place to rent a chaise and umbrella for the day, or hang out at one of the many bars and restaurants.",
          "Be there to know",
          "At the beach there are men who are harassing women, high paid chairs and not clean at all",
          "Good",
          "You can get there by bicycle, it a beautiful rid on a main road trough some rice fields, I definitely recommend it",
          "Nice beach , not so touristic as the ones on the other side of the island. If you enjoy some peace and quiet you will love it :)",
          "Nice beach but mostly everything you need to pay. Even your seat.",
          "Love the atmosphere here",
          "The price is very expensive (seafood, drink,...) i dont want to go there again",
          "Lovely beach, go further for better spots (salt pub beach quite clean). If you are in Hoi An you can chill out and a sun beds is about \u20ac2 a day or 20,000 dong for 2 hours. Lots of aquatic sport to choose from. Recommended.",
          "To enjoy the beach we had to go far from enter, but if somebody likes to sit in the crowd, it's good place",
          "Many restaurants with private beach, some activities, beautiful scenery. Taxi is always waiting for you. Convenient but staying 2 hours is just enough for me(I didn't step on the sand).",
          "Highly polluted air by speed boats, if you want dirty air and damage your lung,  please come here.",
          "Beautiful beach, lots of places to hire sunbeds or buy drinks. Lovely sea for swimming. Only a short cycle out of Hoi An, costs about 10,000 to work your bike but nice to have someone watch it for you. Would love to go back.",
          "Soft sand long beach",
          "Very touristy beach, prices reflect that too. Couple of nice bars a few streets back.",
          "Best place on the island. A little hard to find, even with GPS. If going on your own, once you get to fork in the road, stay to the right. Paradiso to the left is expensive chair rentals. 300,000 VND for 2ppl. It is however a little \u2026",
          "It's very clean! Perfect for a morning stroll... Please note that we have to park our our bicycles/bikes before entering.",
          "Stunning! Do not miss beach in Viet Nam. Tropical palms swaying in the gentle breeze make it paradise.",
          "Very clean beach. The lounge chairs belong to the restaurants so just pick a place you\u2019ll want to eat / get drinks at and they\u2019ll give you a lounge chair for free. There\u2019s also plenty of parking for bicycles and motorcycles in the area. We were able to park two bicycles for 5000 dong. You can also ride sea-doos here.",
          "The beach is sadly being consumed by erosion, and seems to be gradually disappearing - one winter storm by another. It\u2019s still a great spot, though. My favourite beach in the Hoi An/Da Nang area. \n\nSoul Kitchen and The DeckHouse are both great beach restaurants!",
          "Beautiful beach , big waves when we visited couldn't really swim in the sea . Loads of sun beds all attached to restaurants behind , nothing for the beds but you buy the drinks from the restaurants. Lovely b\u00e1nh m\u00ec in a caf\u00e8 opposite ATM . \u2026",
          "As far as beaches go, this is great easy location to get to if staying home Hoi An. Its an easy 3 or 4 km bike rose from Hoi An, but definitely watch out for the scooters and traffic! The beach is nice, and was wavy when we visited in \u2026",
          "Yes; it is beautiful and fresh sea food",
          "Nice beach but the locals are annoying trying to make you pay to park your bike. We barely got a look at the beach",

          "Beautiful, clean beach with lots of restaurants. It was a very relaxing day.",
          "Lovely beach but they charge you to park a bicycle, and also charge for sunbeds.\n\nWe found that the better way was to go a little further down the coast down one of the little roads. Bike parking is free and you can get free loungers with umbrellas if you purchase a beer for 30k.",
          "As far as organised beaches go this ais as good as any. Pick an establishment, pay for your sun loungers and chill... Water and beach are clean.",
          "Cozy atmosphere. Great sun and beach. Kind people.",
          "Really beautiful beach. We had lunch in the vegan fisherman's cafe which is to the right at you face the sea. Really safe / gentle water to swim in as well",
          "I do not think one's top priority, when visiting Vietnam, should be to go to beaches but quite a few tourists would seem keen to do so.\nPaying An Bang beach a visit is no harm. It is the best one from the few in the local area. The beach is \u2026",
          "Nice clean beach, plenty of sunbed rental options, the usual people trying to sell things but a polite no thank you sends them on their way. Slightly aggressive parking attendants on the way in but nothing out of the ordinary for Vietnam.",

          "A bit crowded and 'touristy', but alright for a quick dip. Not great for swimming due to the constant waves and very shallow water. Unsuitable for snorkeling.",
          "Very very crowded and you have to pay for everything. Even if you want to put your bike somewhere in the nowhere...\nBut for sure many restaurants with fresh seafood and local food and so on...\nAnyway definitely not a place you \u201chave to see\u201d.\nThere exist much better and calmer beaches around in this area!",
          "Beautiful \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Great! Not crowded place. Peaceful and calm. The main problem that the food around this place is quite expensive",

          "Nice beach for those who like a busy one.lots of  restaurants, chairs and shade available, but unlike some beaches, you must eat or pay for a chair. Having a couple beer isn't good enough",
          "Nice and clean beach. A lot of persistent vendors and restaurant employees.\nYou can either pay for a lounger in the shade (150k) or eat at their restaurant (all restaurants will offer this). We did it and had the worst vegetarian fried rice/noodles in Vietnam.",
          "Be careful of the very aggressive parking lady & man trying to get you to park your bike. Just park it at a restaurant of your choice or somewhere along the beach if you find a spot.",

          "It was great.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone",
          "Avoid the deck chairs... The grief from the Ladies is horrendous.  In my situation, I was on the border of Vietnam and my mate was in Cambodia (analogy) I had to buy drinks from one bar and my mate had to buy drinks from another bar. \u2026",
          "Went there for the sunrise, and surprisingly saw a lot of locals doing all kinds of morning exercise. Very interesting. There is also paragliding service with decent price. But I will choose other beach during the day for chill out",

          "Very crowded beach. Rows of sunbeds which resemble battery hen cages and was then asked to move so they could squeeze in more tourists. Food is expensive. Wouldn't go back",
          "Beautiful beach, especially in the direction of Da Nang after the tourist sun beds stop; its quiet, he sea is clean and you get hassled less by vendors selling you stuff. \nOnly downside to this beach, is the litter left by fishermen and \u2026",
          "The beach is lovely. Lots of foreign tourists on the beach. There are lots of sunbeds, but none of them are free. Though some are offered for free if you eat in their restaurants. Pro tip is to bargain for everything. Beach is very lovely with white sand and waves are good. Must visit when in Hoi An.",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "The day and night in ancient Hoi An is just that night and day. During the day it feels very fabricated and disneylandish, but when the night time hits it turns into a fury of excitement and wonder with all the activity and lanterns on the streets and in the water. I highly",

          "This town is the most beautiful and magical sight after sunset as it gets darker, all the lanterns light up the place like an absolute magic in front of your eyes :) Boat ride in water is OK but worth it when you visit fiest time. Just grab a drink in one of the bar and sit",
          "shame..the place is wonderful both during the day while visiting all temples (there are many) then in the evening with the lights from the lanterns on the small boat but... the harassment never stop ! from the moment you leave your hotel people follow you or harass you from shop",

          "It\u2019s majestic here at night, the river lights up like nothing I\u2019ve every seen. For pennies on the dollar one could purchase a lantern, make a wish, and send it down the river. It\u2019s an amazing sight to see, the river at night! This alone, make it worth the visit!",

          "This quaint little town is a beautiful place to visit. It full of the hustle and bustle of Vietnam life. We spent many hours just sitting enjoying a drink and watching the day go by. The town turned into a mass of flowers for Tet, the New Year celebrations. Everyone was busy",
          "If you like holiday destinations in SE Asia this is right up there in terms of interest, sophistication (relatively) and safety. We went every on foot and by bicycle. We visited the beach at An Bang but reckon Cua Dai is better. A lot of tat on sale but no pressure from vendors",
          "We stayed in Hoi An for 5 nights & spent each night exploring another street/strip of the old town & still didn\u2019t see it all. We rode bikes & walked through - both are fun, bikes are a bit challenging through the markets but it\u2019s doable, lots of great shops & restaurants to",

          "Hoi an ancient town takes you back in time and is so vibrant with all the different colored lanterns it\u2019s well worth the visit.",
          "The ancient town is a wonderful experience. Just be prepared to pay an entrance fee. You can wander the markets and take a boat ride at night to place a lantern on the river. The outdoor eating is brilliant along the waterfront and is so cheap.",
          "While this is a VERY popular part of Vietnam and you will be sure to run into far too many tourists in the evenings, this is an exceptional part of the country. I recommend starting your days early to beat the crowds. Don't miss exploring the old temples and houses in Ancient",
          "The last time something took my breath away is The Taj Mahal. Hoi An is something like that. Basically it is an old colony which has been completely transformed into a tourist town. Basically, every establishment out there is either a restaurant or a shop and all of them put up",

          "Each shop or cafe by itself is nice but on the whole it becomes overdone and now crowded with tourists so hard to walk. Would suggest at the most one night stay in Hoi An and do Old Town during the day. It may be hot but you will avoid the mass of tourists that come at night",
          "We really enjoyed the ability to wander through the food and shops. You don\u2019t really realize it, but there is lovely music piped in throughout which makes the experience feel that much more enjoyable. Loved it.",
          "We were lucky to visit the Ancient Town at the Full Moon festival and it was very romantic with all the lights and boats though the sellers are rather aggressive in their marketing. The place was also beautiful during the day time and we enjoyed the walk there. Plenty of places",
          "Such a quaint place to spend either a few hours, or a few days! Shopping, cafes, bicycle rides and lantern making galore!",
          "Anyone who doesn\u2019t rate Hoi an as FIVE star has had a lobotomy. Between 6pm - 10pm the lights make this majestic trading city a sight never to be forgotten. Buy the city ticket which gives admission to five sites. Well done to the government for protecting this beautiful place.",
          "If you visit Hoi An, you can\u2019t avoid going to the ancient city, but brace yourself for streets crowded with many, many tourists, a lot of motorbikes all beeping at anything that moves, sidewalks packed with everything but pedestrians (mostly scooter parking), and high tourist",
          "Just beautiful!!! What more can I say!! Hoi An is just gorgeous! We stayed for 4 nights and loved every minute of it! Lovely friendly people, picturesque and so full of character and history. We used our Hotels free bikes and rode everywhere and as it\u2019s all flat it was",

          "A must visit if going to Vietnam. Hoi An perfectly captures the new and old in a wonderful and enchanting mix. Great sights, great restaurants, interesting coffee shops, wonderful tailors. Original Taste of Hoi An Food Tour is a must do.",
          "Back again after a visit last year. Yes, it's touristy but the people go to a great effort to make you welcome everywhere. It still has a lot of character. And the prices are so reasonable. Remember when they approach you to buy something they are just trying to make a living.",
          "Although Hoi An Old Town is getting more and more popular among groups of loud Chinese and Korean tourists, there are ways to enjoy a stroll in the old town without encountering them. The best time to visit the town is early in the morning, but avoid it in the late afternoon,",
          "Bustling during the day but just beautiful at night. The town comes to life and the Lanterns add a magical touch. Great for dinner and a walk through the town after dark.",
          "Hoi An is an acquired taste. Crazy busy town with mad mad traffic and a market that you will either love or hate. Lots of cheezy tourist shops and lots of very cool tailor shops. Pick your poison. Good luck finding a sidewalk, they are all jammed with parked scooters and shop",
          "with short distance from Da Nang this ancient town is really different from others. Seems old town remain untouched and show is past beauty, low buildings, narrow streets and promenade have a special vibe. Handicrafts are specific here as well as you can get your new pair of",

          "Everyone knows that a trip to Vietnam isn't complete without a visit to the very beautiful and unique city of Hoi An. Some people, curiously, just do a day or overnight trip here but we found that 4 nights was just perfect to explore it both on bicyle and foot. Be sure and see",
          "Love this place, you need to experience it during the day, & night as it is completely different. It comes more alive at night with all the lantern boats, night markets, & no vehicles. It is an experience being out on a one boat lantern, & a full lantern boat, as they go in",
          "Should be lovely but the old town is just a long procession of shops and constant harassment. There are some interesting corners of the town but overcrowded and depressing.",
          "In the evening it was pretty, but it was VERY crowded... only tourist, not a very genuin feeling. But it was pretty to see one night (one time) but would not go back. The best thing was to walk around the river after all the people had put down the small lanterns in the water",
          "We didn't follow any tour, I read a load about the town before going. First, we went to the Hoi An Office of Tourist Services to purchase our entrance ticket to some world heritage old houses, museums and ancient temples. One entrance ticket allows you to visit five places in",
          "This place is absolutely stunning as soon as you step in, beautiful lanterns all over the place, amazing food options. The whole walk is mesmerising to say the least! Can\u2019t get enough of it. We actually extended our stay in Hoi An to keep coming back to the ancient town.",
          "Ancient town is super busy but so good. We came here two years ago and it wasn\u2019t that busy, this time it was out of control but still has character and is an awesome town to visit. The bars, restaurants and shops are all very good. Love the lanterns and can\u2019t wait to go back in",
          "Words cannot describe Hoi An. You must experience it for yourself. Walking through the streets is like being in a fairytale.",
          "We really enjoyed walking through the old town (especially when there were no scooters). If you take the ticket to visit it, you can go to up to five monuments and I would recommend those ones: Phuoc Kien Hoi, Quang Dong, house Phung Hung, house Tan Ky and house Tran. To cross",
          "What a beautiful place to visit! You feel as though you are back in time with the many colorful lanterns all lit at night...the most beautiful time to visit. Seeing the lanterns and candles floating on the river was breathtaking. Loved all the ancient architecture and buildings",
          "Stunning town with superb ambience. Great food, great people and great value for money. Walking around is safe and enjoyable with so much on offer from tailor made goods to artwork and souvenirs",
          "After spending a few weeks in Vietnam over December 2019 / January 2020, I can say that Hoi An was definitely my favourite spot. Great to explore during the day to see all the landmarks, and equally cool at night with all the laterns lit up. The only negative thing to be aware",
          "One of the best quaint little towns I've visited... Beautiful place full of life. The local population is extremely talented in all kinds of handicrafts. Extremely polite & friendly people... The town had preserved their culture & heritage. Their expertise less in making high",
          "The town is very pretty with many bars and restaurants. Would also recommend a ride on a lantern boat - it\u2019s very romantic and supports the locals. Just be careful not to flash your wallet/purse as it can get crowded after sunset and there can be pickpockets around.",
          "I have travelled many places in Asia and I would say Hoi An is one of the most enjoyable cities I have been too. So many happy friendly people. Highly recommend.",
          "We spent 5 nights in Hoi An, ostensibly to see the historic buildings and visit My Son. We found the city to be exceptionally touristy, with the historic buildings hidden amongst the shops and 3/4 nights would have been enough. Lots of people are trying to make a dong or two,",
          "We spent 3 nights in Hoi An, and wandered the streets of ancient town every night. Several streets are mainly walking streets, with just a handful of motorbikes, making for a much calmer walk. Lots of restaurants, shops, bars, etc. For sure, most of the shopping is leather,",
          "I think this must just be the prettiest city I have ever seen. It is a UNESCO world heritage site and the minute you step in, you feel like you have gone back in time and stepped in the Vietnam of 17th-8th century. The houses have been well preserved and now being used as shops",
          "Really nice place to look at and I imagine once it was just delightful. But it's really just so tiresome to have to dodge the people constantly shouting at you trying to scam you. The fruit women are the worst, literally witnesses several people paying $5 for one small banana!",
          "Stayed in Hoi An for 12 days October 2019 loved every day I was here,you can walk or ride bike into ancient town from your resort or catch taxi for around 50,000 vnd.Visit the many restaurants and shops in Ancient town.",
          "Beautiful place... cruising, fresh food, time to relax, kayaking, visiting the caves, so much charm and character.",
          "We often go here by motorbike. During the day wandering around and eat streetfood. After 17h streetlights goes on and is do romantic to see. Better to stay here overnight so you do not miss anything",
          "Don't get lost in the markets and be prepared to see and smell a special atmosphere. The traffic is a challenge but at the same time fascinating. Very friendly people.",
          "Hoi An ancient town is bustling, hectic, manic and very hot. It's a must-see for any tourist, but expect to be hassled at every opportunity by locals trying to sell their wares and tours. I'm not criticising as they're trying to make a living, but it's something to be aware",
          "Hoi An a town like I had never seen before. Amazing history, buildings that have survived wars, and a magical atmosphere at night with all the lanterns decorating the streets and boats. There is the shopping and hundreds of tailors ready to make suits/ dresses and reasonable",
          "I liked this town quite a bit. It was festive and quite pretty at night. It is also a large shopping mall but you can get bespoke clothes made.",
          "I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve visited Hoi An. Maybe this is visit number 5! I\u2019ve just enjoyed 10 days - relaxing, cycling, visiting my favourite tailor and enjoying the delightful food. Last visit I discovered Autumn, at La Vangs tailor in Cu Dai street. She has",
          "I love the Old Quarter for its charm, quaint and as if time stood still and traveling back in time cycling and walking around the lanes and shops. Very relaxing sipping a Vietnamese coffee watching the wold go by and visiting much of the heritage buildings. My second visit and",
          "When we visited during end-of-year holidays 2019-2020, there seemed to be more tourists than locals in the streets. There is a ridiculous amount of random silly stuff for tourists to buy. The buildings are very well preserved and curious to visit. Beware most of the \u2018assembly",
          "At the Hoi An Hotel...I have the satisfaction to learn some topical dishes and to visit a farm to learn and see the way the vegetables are planting and harvested. I have the pleasure to expend one day along the canals with the help of my amazing Tour Guide Vo Duc Thanh from a",
          "A beautiful small town and a highlight in Hoi An. A must see if you are nearby! Get a lantern boat down the river (we paid $400,000 dong for 4 adults) and enjoyed happy hour at a riverside bar afterwards. A lovely and memorable experience.",
          "The streets are narrow, winding & busy. Watch out for scooters. Loads of little boutique shops, clothes shops, knick knack shops & lanterns hung everywhere. Totally picturesque. Make sure you haggle!!",
          "Hoi An is so beautiful City, people friendly and helping. We can find anything we like in here. Great",
          "Very nice town all lit with lanterns. Once you enter the town it looks like really a small road but then it ends up in the big square area with river in between and restaurants and shops around. All are lit with colorful lanterns. Lot of food options and many shops for",
          "Nice old buildings now all full of tourist services. Cafes, hotels, bars, shops, shops, shops. The savvy Vietnamese know that tourists shop like crazy, so go crazy buying lanterns, silk, paintings, leather, tailored clothes and have shoes made for you. There is the usual same",
          "Old down town of Hoi An is most colorful at night. Lots to see, lots to shop and lots to eat. A great place to sharpen your bargaining skill. People are polite and friendly. The feel of a trading hub is strong, know what you want, pay what you need, otherwise the misconception",
          "A very nice little town. Amazing is the illumination in the evening and the night market. Very good seafood at many, many high or top level restaurants. Worth every Dong.",
          "This place is unbelievable. So much history and the food in this place is second to none. We\u2019ve been here 4 times it\u2019s that good. If you are to go, try and go in January as the weather is quite cool compared to summer. You won\u2019t be able to enjoy the old town as it is too hot.",
          "The old town is a great experience especially at night. Lots of shops, museums and restaurants. Some of the roads are closed to traffic at night which is a great benefit. In the evening all the boats on the river are a great sight with their multi coloured lanterns illuminated",
          "An absolute must visit wherever you stay in Hoi An.....Just so special especially in the evening when the lanterns light up the sky and all around. Market and shops are brilliant.....restaurants ...such an array of choice...atmosphere at night is terrific....a magic place to",
          "quaint. many shops and even a theatre for cultural show and lantern msking. walking streets - safe many eateries and unique shops",
          "Hoi An is an amazing town - very nice to walk around. You must haggle hard and at least at a third of the price that is quoted. You can bike or walk around the town - and there are loads of places to shop at !",
          "Amazing village full of life during the day with it,s markets and shops, and during the night it turns to fabulous lanterns everywhere",
          "After sunset, view here turned. In the daytime, it has wonderful view, but after sunset, all lanterns were lighted. It brought us to old and fantastic world. There were many restaurants here. Prices were various, I mean, from rather expensive to cheaper. We had lunch and dinner",
          "Enjoyed the atmosphere here and walking around this town! I loved the colours and the lanterns at night!",
          "We are pleasantly surprised by this picturesque town. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been in Vietnam. Cosy, cute and affordable. You can get literally anything custom made here at an affordable price!",
          "I really enjoyed my evening walk around Hoi An. It has a very nice relaxing feel to it. It was crowded and busy but not frenetic and uncomfortable. I thought it was clean and well laid out.",
          "Amazing food, cooking classes (Red Bridge highly recommended), shopping, tailored clothes (shop around), beautiful lanterns, it has it all. Watch those bikes!!",
          "Great place. Vibrant and excellent shopping. We had a great time. Did a bike ride through the fields and went to the beach too. Sea water very warm.",
          "Our tour driver dropped us a few blocks from the river as that part by the rivery is mainly pedestrain. We walked thru narrow alleys. We did have to watch out for bicycles and mopeds. At the river, the crowds got worse. We hung around until just before 6 PM when the laterns",
          "It is very colourful and vibrant with lanterns, nice view of Japanese covered bridge and river. There are shops, cafes and restaurants around river and inner side of city. It is a lovely area to discover.",
          "Beautiful visit to visit, 40 minutes from Danang. It\u2019s old center is a UNESCO world heritage site. Make sure you walk around and buy a ticket from kiosks that allows you to enter 5 sites for 120,000 dong, and use them wisely. Make sure you try some of their traditional foods",
          "We loved the quaint old town of Hoi An and were so happy we made it here. So many great shops and food places. You need to stay until after dark to see the beauty of the lanterns everywhere. The boat ride down the river is fun too. I loved the food here more than anything,",
          "Hoi An is such a beautiful place to visit. During the day, you will get to take selfie pictures with its yellow walled houses. At night, the ancient town lit up to become a romantic town of lanterns.",
          "We are very fond of Hoi An and we have already visited it a couple of times. We really like its landscape and relaxed atmosphere. It is nice to stroll around, try some of the traditional Hoi An dishes or have some tailor clothes made. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Touristic, nice and relax place at day time , busy and beautiful old city at night time, good to stay at least one night here",
          "The architecture and the buildings are beautiful. Best to avoid peak holiday seasons as the crowd might not allow you to enjoy the scenery as much. Most of the stores in the area offering pretty much the same or similar products as the area is renowned for. Few good restaurants",
          "Not to be missed while in central Vietnam. We made it a point to get back to the old quarters in the Ancient town in Hoi An every day. Great food choices , superb shopping options and magical atmosphere.",
          "Walking around in Ancient Town is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Go after sunset, and the lights will be stunning. The place is almost drowning with tourists though, but you'll have to live with it. That said, and the place is beautiful, a couple of hours is",

          "We may have been unlucky, going on a Saturday evening, but the crowds really do spoil the place. Beautiful buildings but difficult to see past the crowds - it was like a football stadium in parts, with queues to cross bridges. Hope to be wrong, but unfortunately with the huge",

          "My partner and I visited in January 2020, as part of a two week tour of Vietnam. We absolutely loved Hoi An. It's so pretty and much quieter and more chilled than the other places we visited in Vietnam. The river is beautiful at night and is a lovely quiet place to relax at",
          "Ancient town is fascinating, silk worms, local crafts and other shopping! Route from Danang to Hoi An is beautiful in itself - rice fields, water buffalo but some crazy driving! Silk factory was great - in addition to rack clothing, they will measure, sew and deliver to your",
          "Halong Bay is a feast for the senses. The imposing limestone rocks, the tranquil water, the fresh sea breeze all combine to give a surreal experience. Add to that the experience of cruising in the luxury \"V Spirit\", this is the ideal memory to take back home. A big thank you to",

          "I'm sure Hoi An is the most appealing town to the foreigners as it brings special amazing ancient beauty that is unique in Vietnam. You can ride bicycle around the town, enjoy some famous local street food, have a coffee at the rooftop with stunning view over the ancient town",
          "This place has a vibe, we loved it! We had originally booked Hoi An for 3 nights and ended up extending to 5 nights. Strolling the old town in the early morning is peaceful. We also enjoyed grabbing a Vietnamese coffee in the afternoon and doing some people watching. Of",

          "Love love the vibe of the city at night. There are loads of activities, food, drinks and local shopping. It\u2019s very touristic but it\u2019s the tourists that helps bring the city to life at night as Vietnamese are ones to retire to bed early.",
          "Nice little town to explore on foot or bike. Very touristy and full of tourists of all backgrounds. The advantages of this are good food, reasonable standard of English. The cons are the crowds! The whole \u2018touristy\u2019 vibe. Lots of shops. Lots of restaurants. There are",

          "Yes, it is a tourist place but it is still a lot of fun strolling around Hoi An Old Street.  At night this place lights up with lanterns all around which is a pretty sight.  You can find a different kind of vibe here at night with buskers \u2026",

I went back at night to markets but I was by myself and was scared to get lost so I didn't find the bridge all lit up at night which was disappointing.

          "Nice place. Lightnings light up at night makes the whole place very romantic and cosy.",
          "Beautiful mustard yellow walls and preserved antique architecture. The mandatory entry fee can be a little confusing to tourists since there isn't a clear gated border. Apart from that take time to check out the local cafes and soak in the atmosphere. Stay till evening to catch the sight of paper lanterns drifting in the river (daily).",

        "wiki": "The Man Show is an American comedy television show on Comedy Central that aired from 1999 to 2004. It was created in 1999 by its two original co-hosts, Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel, and their executive producer Daniel Kellison.\nThe Man Show simultaneously celebrated and lampooned the stereotypical loutish male perspective in a sexually charged, humorous light. The show consisted of a variety of pre-recorded comedy sketches and live in-studio events, usually requiring audience participation.\nThe Man Show is particularly well known for its buxom female models, the Juggy Dance Squad, who would dance in themed, revealing costumes at the opening of every show, in the aisles of the audience just before The Man Show went to commercial break, and during the end segment \"Girls on Trampolines\".\nThe first year of The Man Show featured beer-guzzling entertainer Bill 'The Fox' Foster as the show's emcee. Foster specialized in chugging two beers in record time (sometimes while suspended upside down) and singing lewd drinking songs. He would close every episode by leading the audience in the German drinking toast Zicke, Zacke, Zicke, Zacke, Hoi, Hoi, Hoi!, a tradition that the show continued after his death from prostate cancer in 2000.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Notable segments ==\nOne skit featured Carolla and Kimmel setting up a booth at a farmer's market and successfully asking people to sign a petition to \"end women's suffrage\", demanding the repeal of the 19th Amendment (which guarantees women's voting rights). This sketch humorously revealed widespread fundamental political ignorance in the general population and how terminology could be used to manipulate public opinion. The majority of people who came to the booth, both men and women, were willing to sign the petition.\nA hidden-camera prank showed Carolla and Kimmel, dressed as hunters, tying an animatronic deer to the roof of a car, parked at a truck stop, using the deer to prank unsuspecting passersby. Carolla and Kimmel hid in a van parked nearby, making the deer move and talk, asking people to untie it, and even asking a police officer to shoot it.\nThe Man Show tribute to The Benny Hill Show\nThere were several hidden-camera segments featuring \"The Man Show Boy\" Aaron Hamill, who was 11 years old at that time. One skit had him standing outside a liquor store asking customers to buy him beer, while in another he walked around on a beach hitting on women. He made one-liners, which always caught people he approached off-guard. An episode featured him walking around with a puppy. When a man stopped to pet the dog, he told him, \"I just use him to get girls. Unfortunately, I've been attracting gay guys all day though.\" Another notable skit by Aaron Hamill took place outside, with him running a beer stand. Similar to the classic lemonade stand, the boy set up in the middle of a public sidewalk, trying to sell beer  instead of lemonade, to pedestrians. He grabbed attention of many people, using foul language and savage behavior, including a line telling a woman: \"listen up, Hitler, there's no Germans here, you can get lost\" as she was stating her opinion on the boy's illegal selling of alcohol, and telling a couple that the boyfriend should drink both beers so his girlfriend would look better.\nThe hosts visited Snoop Dogg's house, where they messed around with him in his recording studio, as well as getting stoned with him off-screen in his \"Green Room\".\nOne recurring skit featured Kimmel's impression of former Utah Jazz star Karl Malone. Kimmel would appear in blackface make-up while wearing a bald cap and body suit, filmed at an angle which made it look like Kimmel (who is much shorter in real life than Malone) was very tall, and dole out advice on subjects such as history, health, and China. The impression pokes fun at Malone's well-known inarticulacy, and Kimmel's impression strongly implied that Malone was stupid, reliant on having the \"Jamz\" star player repeat himself constantly, refer to himself in the third person, speak in an odd Southern accent, and throw in a large number of double negatives.\nThe 1999, 2000, and 2001 seasons occasionally featured segments entitled \"The Monkey Bar\", where chimpanzees duplicated real-life human exploits in a similar style to that of the 1970s American Broadcasting Company program Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp. One such performance entailed a conversation in a bar which referred to a penguin joke. In another, (not in the Monkey Bar setting) Jimmy Kimmel sent his (then) wife, Gina, to Poland in order to allow him to be with his new \"simian wife\", referred to by his real-life children as \"monkey mommy\".\n\"The Wheel of Destiny\", a recurring segment based on the chance to receive either pain or pleasure resulting from the spin of a wheel. Good prizes included a ride in the 1960s Batmobile with Adam West, a wheelbarrow full of porn, a celebrity who would pretend to be their friend (Gary Busey), and eating a candy bra off a porn star. Bad prizes included \"Adam pees on your wallet\", \"Shave your eyebrows\", \"Forklift Wedgie\", and \"Call your mommy and admit that you masturbate\".\n\n\n== Departure of Kimmel and Carolla ==\nIn 2003, Kimmel and Carolla left The Man Show, with the hosting jobs passed down to comedians Joe Rogan and Doug Stanhope. With the hosting change came a re-composition of the show's theme song. The new pair hosted the show for two more seasons before it ceased production in 2004, after its final episode aired on June 19th.\n\n\n== Post-series ==\nKimmel went on to host his own late-night show for ABC, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, which he has hosted since 2003. Carolla stayed with Comedy Central to host Too Late with Adam Carolla in 2005 and then became part of CBS Radio's Free FM experiment after Howard Stern joined Sirius Satellite Radio; his talk show, The Adam Carolla Show, ran until 2009. Carolla continues to do the show as a daily podcast and also co-hosts the Spike show Catch a Contractor. Carolla has appeared on Kimmel's program several times (more so than any other guest) during its run.Rogan continued to host Fear Factor for three more years after The Man Show was cancelled and eventually became color commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which he has been associated with since its early days. Stanhope continues to perform standup comedy.\nIn 2012, for the season 4, episode 29 of Tosh.0, titled \"Virgin Trampoline Jumper\", Daniel Tosh revisited The Man Show with hosts Joe Rogan and Doug Stanhope, in which they made the claim that the show still gets filmed. The hosts gave advice for a man who was 37 and still a virgin; they then set him up with a Juggy Girl.\nIn October 2017, several clips from the series began to resurface, including clips of Kimmel's impersonations of Karl Malone.\n\n\n== Notable Juggy Girls ==\nRebecca Grant\nChristy Hemme - American professional wrestler and WWE Diva\nVanessa Kay\nJoanna Krupa\nCandice Michelle - American professional wrestler and WWE Diva\nNicole Pulliam\n\n\n== Syndication and DVDs ==\nIn the late 2000s, reruns of The Man Show aired on G4TV weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET and 10:30 p.m. ET, and on Saturdays at 12:00 a.m. ET. It was originally thought that the Rogan-Stanhope-era episodes would not be shown because the commercials referred to the syndicated episodes as \"the way Jimmy and Adam made it\". However, Canadian channel mentv included the Rogan/Stanhope episodes in its schedule. G4TV also aired the Rogan-Stanhope episodes, but only a few times.\nThe first four seasons of The Man Show are also available on DVD.\n\n\n== International versions ==\nA Norwegian version of The Man Show was aired on TV 2 Zebra in 2006 and 2007, and ran its third season in 2008.In Denmark, there was a version called Penisl\u00e6gens v\u00e6rksted (The Penis-doctors workshop) on TV2-Zulu.\nA Turkish version was adapted by Play Productions and aired on Star TV in 2000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Man Show on IMDb\nThe Man Show at TV.com\nComedy Central site\nPazsaz Entertainment Network - Episode Information And Airdates\nTheManShow.com at the Wayback Machine (archive index)",

          "Loved everything about this place.  It was fun, interesting and entertaining.  Family friendly.  We felt very safe.  The people are super friendly and seem to be very glad that we were visiting their country.  Food was excellent and very reasonable priced. The shopping is wonderful.  Be sure and take a boat ride after dark.",
          "Oh my goodness, yasah girl! Go here! It was so fun! It's part of the UNESCO heritage site and has lots of little stores, souvenirs, amazing street food, and restaurants. There's also cultural games and stuff like that happening if you are willing to wander around. It's very crowded but has a festival atmosphere. Totally worth going.",
          "Get a taste of local flavours here. Street foods are aplenty here. Souvenirs too. Visitors can also hang out at one of the cafes and clubs along the street while soaking the atmosphere.",
          "A place with ancient history and exotic charms of Vietnam. Cute handmade things and local specialties.",
          "The market was very touristic and crowded . They operate between 6-9pm although the asking price of the goods is always high. The street food is a gamble as it can be good or you might visit the hospital.. i saw dead raw lobsters that some brave people tried to taste them...",
          "This place has an amazing vibe in the night. You get to see vibrant colored lanterns all around, souvenirs, gift items, jewelry, clothes etc to buy and spread of good street food (vegetarian options too). A must visit after 6:30 PM.",
          "This is a must visit, especially after the sunset. The place lights up with colourful lanterns everywhere. Even on the river. There are boats that have lanterns on it and you can go for a round and click a million photos. There\u2019s so much \u2026",
          "Pretty good. There are a few unique snacks here. The lighting is really pretty. Unfortunately you get haggled every 20 seconds.",
          "If you're in Hoi An,  you will spend a lot of time here,  wonderful market, food,  street vendors,  shopping and food! Oh the riverside at night is the place to be!!!",
          "Fantastic market. You can get really good deals on hand made products like shoes.",
          "A wonderful local market near Japanese bridge. One can enjoy here the street food and shopping. Also boating in Thu Ban River is worth enjoying. And if you float candles in the memory of your near and dear ones who departed, it adds to the \u2026",
          "Market was lively and full of locals and tourists! The shops were open till 9pm which was very handy for us.\nThe stalls had a good selection of street food and clothes/bags/souviniers.\nThe only reason why I\u2019m giving this a four star is \u2026",
          "Hoi An by night is magical. I wouldn't say the market by itself is worth it. It's very small and all the stalls are the same (ice cream rolls, banana pancakes, jewellery and souvenirs, clothes), but it's worth going to see the illuminated lanterns everywhere.",
          "A beautiful market,  very picturesque place, worthy of a walk.",
          "Lively place. Looks Awesome in the evening. Lots of things to eat especially Vietnamese pizza, Crepe, Fruits etc. Local beer and cafes rocks",
          "An enjoyable bedlam. If you don't mind crowded chaos, the night market is straight out of a Disney movie. The lantern boats and ancient buildings provide a beautiful backdrop to the street vendors and restaurants.",
          "The place is quite touristy, but dont be afraid to taste the local foods that are being prepared on both sides of the market. If you go all the way to the end, there is one legitimately good lobster stand that also has shrimp with blue \u2026",
          "Food was delicious and cheap as well, I tried a classic banh mi, a vietnamese pancake which incorporated beef and other vegetables and sauces into what resembled a large taco. Finally we also tried the banana pancakes, which were more like \u2026",
          "Very lively night market. You can find local food and snack. Most of the food here is will have the second price for tourists (higher than normal price), and the taste are not that great. Clothing and bags are very cheap. \n\nThe night market starts from 18:00 - 23:00.\nBut there are lots of shop that still open till late night.",
          "Beautiful to walk around at night. Very colorful with friendly vendors. Food is good in area. If you have insomnia this is the place to be. Loved it.",
          "Pretty to walk down to absorb the atmosphere but unfortunately incredibly touristy with stalls trying to rip off tourists with incredibly inflated prices. For example below are the prices given in the Hanoi night market vs Hoi an market \u2026",
          "Leather stores everywhere. Gotta pick up something leather. 200k for a really nice wallet, 160k for a hand made silk tie and cuff links",
          "It's all about the ambiance. The river and banks are populated with an abundance of lanterns. Very beautiful! There is fun street food, tourist kitsch, and restaurants and bars. A must when in the area.",
          "The night market will probably be packed with people, both foreigners and locals, but it's worth a visit. All the lanterns and lights make for a really pretty walk along the water.\n\nIf you take a boat ride, try to bargain down the price a \u2026",
          "Same same .... merchandise does not change much. Friendly happy atmosphere  despite very difficult times.",
          "This is a vibrant place with many shops and restaurants. There are boats on the lake and lights that add to the atmosphere of the place. You won't struggle to find good food or cocktails here!",
          "Lovely market with lots of good food stalls and jewellery, lantern, souvenir stalls. It was very lively when we were there at around 7pm.",
          "Fun to walk around.  Shopping is pretty much the same.  About 8 different \"shops\" but 20 of each plus a bunch of food options.",
          "Beautifulll!!! Amazing!! Extraordinary!! The streets, the cloth shops \ud83c\udfec where glyph can order any suit you would like at very reasonable prices!! Just choose the outfit you want and they will make it for you!! Not expensive, at all!! The \u2026",
          "Definitely worth a walk around as a tourist. Lots of stalls selling same items so don't be afraid to shop around and haggle. Wear good shoes and bring water. Some small food stalls, and other restaurants with higher prices. Be prepared to \u2026",
          "The market has a lot of charm to it!\nPro tip, if you're at a food stall and it looks like the food they sell has been sitting there for a few hours, ask to make a new one. My friend had a bad experience with some food that felt like it was \u2026",
          "Great atmosphere in this lovely night market set in the back drop of all the lanterns floating down the river. The food is really good and there is plenty of choice, from bbq shellfish to delicious banana pancakes.",
          "One of \u0110\u00e3 N\u1eb5ng's premiere locations, H\u1ed9i An Night Market was a lot of fun, but only when the sun goes down.\n\nThere are a lot of activities and it's quite enjoyable seeing all types of folks of different nationalities on the globe walking \u2026",
          "The other side of the river turns alive and happening at night. \nThe night market actually closes around 10 pm. The goods they\u2019re selling at the same as the other stores in old town. Here they have also some sea food - that you can have \u2026",
          "Very beautiful place. Lots of shops to browse through combined with great street food makes this a must visit",
          "Lot of food venues and lantern shops. Try to find the coconut pancake cake stand. Delicious!",
          "Cute night market with all sorts of food and clothing stalls, I tried the frog on a stick with chilli sauce and it was very nice so would recommend! Can be busy as it's very touristy but it's nice to wander and enjoy the lanterns and boats on the river :)",
          "An amazing place to visit! There's so much to do.\n\n, Lanters hanging out everywhere. Wonderful especially in the night time. you should come in the dawn/dust and light some lanters. It's beautiful to send it across the river. \n\nFor one \u2026",
          "Good variety of food. Not that big and lack variety. I saw fried frogs but didn\u2019t try as I was already hungry.",
          "We went to the night market each of the 3 nights we were there. It was really great and  good prices. The food that we had was all delicious and it was nice to walk around with all the lanterns on the boats and streets. It had a great \u2026",
          "Interesting and lively place. Completely pedestrianised so far easier to enjoy yourself compared to Hanoi etc. There are lots of stalls, most have similar stuff but I found them to be more expensive than other places outside of the \u2026",
          "It was a good place but you need to have your wits about you when you are buying things because they will try to rip you off. At  about 8:30 the music comes alive and the markets die down and the experience really comes alive. It's also a great opportunity for photos.",
          "So much to see, smell and taste. Fun to explore and sample a few bites. But best to go with someone specific in mind you're looking for, as a lot of stands sell similar wares. Part of Hoi An's night scene, have to go at least once if you're a tourist.",
          "An amazing place. The old city us truly special and the night market is fantastic. Really great food, an amazing atmosphere. I was there on  Friday night and it was busy but not overwhelming.",
          "Very pretty when lit up at night, and a must see if visiting Hoi An. Visiting in late October, the market was busy but not overcrowded. The stalls themselves are selling the usual souvenirs, so if you want some cheap tat this is the place \u2026",
          "Good atmosphere but price is not reasonable",
          "Assortment of stalls selling tourist souvenirs, lanterns, street food, cigarettes etc. Stalls start to pack up about 9pm. The street food is great and really cheap, I recommend trying the local rice pancakes - you can also get them vegetarian (and vegan without the quail egg) - look out for green coloured stalls.",
          "The street is lined with food and souvenir vendors (in the middle) and restaurants along the sidewalks. Very central, a fun night",
          "Vibrant food and souveniers style market. Entrance at the japenese bridge over river. Buy great street food and eat it by the river whilst watching boats lit up. Beautiful..",
          "Can find a lot of things they sell at the shops for much cheaper like those beautiful lamps. I highly suggest checking it out.",
          "Lots of lovely little stalls and great street food. Would highly recommend getting yourself a banana pancake - they're amazing. Such a beautiful place",
          "I like it a lot.\nLot of things to see. Long place to walk.\nWe have a lot of choice to shop some things as souvenirs, or to eat\nand of course take beautiful/romantic pictures.",
          "Incredibly massive market with a huge selection of everything and a wide variety in quality. Something for everyone!",
          "Beautiful place and views,  Don't like bargaining. For example those shirts with fruits print. Its started with 450,000 Dong and reduced to 200,000 Dong.\nThe ride on the boat where you put the lighted candle.  Its started with 500,000 Dong \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, a lot of lights in all streets, the market is near the river and you can shop gifts, traditional products and try the local street cousine, 100% recommended",
          "Nothing special just another Vietnamese night market. The boats where pretty could be nice for couples. And they will try to charge you just to enter the market, in my opinion prosperous.",
          "Crowded, noisy, dirty and way over priced. Some of the food specialties were pretty good and reasonably priced. Be careful and know what your change should be. I saw as lot of short changing people. \n\nThe paper lantern shops are quite attractive after dark. Watch your pickets carefully.",
          "Owesome best of the world here only",
          "What an amazing experience. There's truly something for everyone. It's easy to get lost and I can't think of another place I'd rather get lost at. I can't wait to get back!",
          "Quite a lively night market,. somewhat reminiscent of markets you'd find in Taipei with a mix of food vendors selling things like banh trang (grilled rice paper filled with meat, green onions and quail's eggs, delicious!), \"smoking ice \u2026",
          "What a place!!! I was sceptical about it, but how it looks is breathtaking! Colours, lights, food, so many things to see or buy if you want. Streets are full of people, but still it is a place you have to go. If you fancy a boat trip, I strongly recommend. Everything looks different;)",
          "Hoi An is a beautiful part of Vietnam with a more laid back feel than the major cities in Vietnam. The night market comes alive at night with wonderful smells and people across the globe enjoying the sights and sounds of Hoi An. There are \u2026",
          "Hoi an is magical, great market with nice atmosphere. Lanterns.. Vendors often try to rip you off especially late in night.",
          "The market starts by evening, with food to shopping you will love everything about this place. Amazing place to shop for your loved ones when you are traveling and price is much cheaper than the shops in Old Town. Try to bargain.",
          "Totally worth it. Buzzing with with beautiful lighting and lanterns. Very beautiful and awesome for taking pics. Really nice restaurants all along the river and up the streets. Well worth a visit",
          "Lots of vendors hawking a lot of stuff, and a lot of massage places. Food only so-so at best. Maybe the food is better outside of the touristy areas.",
          "Nice night market. There are mainly souvenirs here. There are limited food stalls, mainly selling snacks and such. The people all seemed friendly and there was a decent amount available. However, in comparison to some of the other markets I have visited in the north or Vietnam, it was lacking in some departments. Still worth the visit.",
          "Relaxed night market where the vendors are not too pushy. The stalls will sell the same stuff so don't be afraid to shop around get some prices\n\nThey have some beautiful lantern shops which would make great presents.\n\nHas some great food as well",
          "Very busy, but very colourful too. Lots of food stalls, souvenirs, and beautiful lights. Not a place I would visit often, but it\u2019s an experience.",
          "Hoian is extremely beautiful at night!",
          "Great place to visit while in Hoi An, you have to buy a lantern, there is so much choice.",
          "Better go before sunset, you will see such beautiful view of Hoi An. Many street foods to enjoy while you sight seeing and go around there. Recommend for group of people to enjoy drinking with bbq",

          "The price is quite high. The food is diverse and very delicious. A great experience in Hoi An. In winter, the air is cold, very suitable for the lantern image. I usually come here every weekend.",
          "Really nice to stroll through. Really nice lightening with All the colored lantern in the street and on the water.\nThere are a bit too many tourist around that you get pondered through the street but it still is pretty easy and relaxed. Remindes me of the old days of khao San road with an easy vibe",

          "Hoi An is lit up differently at night. A must visit if you're in hoi an, at night time. Plenty of things to buy, plenty of things to eat, and plenty of locals to meet. It's a beautiful place to be at night. You can even take a boat ride for \u2026",
          "Great old town and world heritage site. Vendor mostly speak either Vietnamese, English or Korean due to large Korean manufacturing influence, entertainment industry and tourists",
          "A lovely place to walk around with lots to see. It closes earlier than we expected for a night market, aim to get there before 9pm to see the best parts.",
          "A fantastic night market with a large selection of food offerings (mainly small sweets and finger foods). Goods are mainly smaller souvineers but nothing unique from any other night market. The atmosphere is great, particularly with \u2026",
          "A must go visit when you are at Hoi An. \nYou will find nice souvenirs and tasty Street food. A lot of clubs and coffee shops around. Romantic atmosphere",
          "I really love coming to Hoi An. The colors and smells are wonderful! The night market only adds to the experience. The people are a lot of fun and very honest. Having said that, make sure that you haggle\ud83d\ude09",

          "Very nice market for street food and souvenirs. You must bargain!",
          "Such a beautiful night market! The lanterns make it magical. The stalls are good value, there is usually about 2-5 different vendors for the same food/clothes/knick-knacks, but it also means that everyone has to be on their game for a good \u2026",
          "Very unique night market by Asian standard. Lined with lots of stalls. A tip - bargain hard. Slash em by 40% and then negotiate from there to see what you can achieve. It was rainy and cold in December. The place was full of Korean \u2026",
          "Very crowded and touristy, but still lovely and charming despite that. A lot of interesting street food, especially the grilled banana pancakes.\n\nA lot of the clothing shops sell identical or very similar things so definitely shop around. \n\nDefinitely wear good shoes and bring water/a fan. Definitely worth visiting more than one night.",
          "It is absolutely beautiful. All the lights and the old buildings are spectacular. Be prepared to be hounded by people trying to sell you boat rides, though. They are persistent and they do become a major annoyance after a while.",
          "Bright colors, Bright lights! A fun place to spend an evening healing for those one of a kind souvenirs.",

          "It is a beautiful sight to see and has been congested with many tourists. The charm of this UNESCO site is evident in both days and nights. An entry ticket per stay is 120VND = 7AUD. There are some interesting display of food but repeatedly I've been told 'no pictures' by the food hawkers.",
          "The PROS ..Was very exciting,  chaotic and pretty with a multitude of coloured lanterns.  The CON is that most store merchandise is the same.",

          "very beautiful. with lantern lights and the coata with colorful lanterns on the river. very romantic. a lot of amazing places for dinner along the river",
          "Great to see. But very tourist orientated. Better than Bali though not being harrased every two steps.",
          "Very touristic place but very cute. Once it\u2019s night time all the streets light up with a lot of lanterns everywhere. Some places charge you when you want to take photos in front of their shops, but it\u2019s like one dollar. \nYou can also have a boat tour on the river, with little lights in the boat.\nOverall a good experience",
          "The whole place is lighted up with colourful lanterns.  Very lively and enjoyable evening walk.",
          "Amazing especially once the sun goes down and the lights come on. Its a wonderful area and the streets are lined woth restaurants, bars and coffee shops.",
          "Too much of the same, just at night.. The lights look pretty but charge you for a photo... Good to go once and that's it",
          "Amazing night market. The atmosphere in town at  night is amazing. All the colorfull lights are making this place unforgetable. Just go there, try some local food from strret grill stands, buy some little souvenir from various market shops, than turn back to river bank, sit down,have a drink and relax. This is Hoi An by night.",
          "Really nice and scenic (instagram friendly) night market in Hoi an. \nIf you want a little extra experience, stay untill late, and walk home when everything is closed or closing, you will understand why we named it 'Rat Capital'. \nYou will \u2026",

          "Hoi An night lights. With a side of boat rides and street food. Enjoy the time here. Have a beer",
          "Tourist trap. Same souvenirs you will find at any touristy place in Vietnam, and you'll constantly be harangued by people trying to sell you a boat ride.\n\nIf you want the real deal, you'd be much better going to the Da Nang night market on a Saturday/Sunday. Much more authentic, and the seafood is half the price.",
          "Hoi An is great. The night market is fun to walk thru.",
          "Really beautiful and lively. Lots of wonderful products to buy and foods to try.",
          "Everything you want in one place ... A good vibe, great souvenirs, friendly people and delicious food.",

          "Such a cute little market with such great vibes. A must visit if you\u2019re in Hoi An already.",
          "Bustling place at night. Wish there was more street shops for the curious but overall v nice place to just chill, lose yourself among the crowds and relax",
          "Very pretty, especially at night but so many tourists there. Difficult to get nice photos because too many people visit.",
          "Good to visit! But you have to be patient cause there are so many people will approach you for massage or boat as well even a bit away from the river. \nBut you can enjoy the variouskind of street food and fruits!",
          "So picturesque it's almost unbelievable. Unlike other night markets, the atmosphere is more relaxed and you can soak up the gorgeous views whilst getting some shopping done",
          "A large market without any local feeling. Just fake clothing and some food. Still... Worth to visit as this is probably the best market in Vietnam, when i compare to Hcmc.",
          "Definitely bargain, otherwise really beautiful surroundings.",
          "This is must do both day and night, Vietnam at its coolest with a slight French influence.",

          "Very beautiful at night with lots of food stalls and shopping.  Right next to the river which makes for a great night.",
          "Unique and beautiful night view with lots of tourists. Be careful of some dishonest local traders who are trying to sell you things that are 10x overpriced. And then, she will reduce the price to 5x if you buy more. I felt not comfortable \u2026",
          "Very friendly and hardworking people, beautiful  layout along the river. Great restaurants and can pick up souvenirs quite cheaply",
          "Visiting the night market in Hoi An, Vietnam can be experienced with local food and culture.  But too many people can't help it",
          "A street market just over the river that is populated with all sorts of street food, trinkets and clothes. Prices are \u2018reasonable\u2019 but always try for a better price.",
          "The light shops are nice to look at or to take pics. Other than that, the market is super touristic and has nothing special.",
          "We can spend nostalgic night",
          "So many shops full of souvenirs, leather goods and restaurants. Choices can be limited and prices can be higher than other regions. Streets are lovely and covered in lanterns.",
          "This place is spectacular at night. Famous for their colourful lanterns. It is a must see attractions in Hoi An..",
          "Nice place to go out at night get some food and do some shopping. Be prepared for the street sellers, they are persistent",
          "Luminous bliss, but prepared to be ensnared by the lure of touts.",
          "Not a large variety of foods but good and you'll come out smelling strongly on smoke from all the grills. You can purchase a nice lantern for cheap from the front section.\nIts a fun experience and decent street food",
          "nice market. the best for me was the lamp shops. you have a lot of street food too",
          "Nice and interesting area in central Hoi An. Very crowded at night and really hot (late June) so plan a couple of stops for drinking. A lot of shops with really touristic stuff. Easy transportation using taxi as well, we tried the green \u2026",
          "Big nighr market. Buy souvenirs or gifts. Enjoy sightseeing and a boat ride. River filled with lanterns",
          "So much going on and lots of fun to be had with the vendors.",

          "Great markets. \nBargain for the best prices in Vietnam.",
          "The food is amazing and the walk around the market is special! Worth going souvenir hunting",
          "Although! Hoin An is very much touristy and little bit of hectic, but it's worth of a visit. Specially in the evening , when street lamp light up and gives a complete different vibe compared to the daytime.",
          "Fun but the stalls  repeat themselves. Just like any other markets. A lot of noise. The things around are more interesting",
          "Very nice. Many shops around and many eateries place that served good foods.",
          "Great place but watch the bars with happy hour its a con",
          "Ate so many yummy snacks here. Really fun to visit, beautiful lantern place.",
          "If you have not been here, please pay a visit. You will not regret for coming here",
          "Most of them are selling more or less the same stuff but you could haggle. Better to buy the paper lanterns from here compared to the ones during the day. Cheaper prices",
          "Nice place to shop but it's to bussy for me.",
          "A wonderful experience. A MUST VISIT. Here's a little pointer, if you are planning to buy anything here please scout around first by asking how much it cost and then only make the purchase. For example, a magnet would cost you about 20,000 VnD  to 30,000 VnD but try to bargain til you reach about 15-17,000 VnD.",
          "Fantastic variety of old and new. I think the Koreans have made this their second home.",
          "It's a crazy place. Still very much worth seeing. You see a lot of the same foods and wares from place to place.",
          "starts at 6pm ends at 10pm was nice to stroll around and look at souvenirs but as usual tbe prices went up as soon as you enter the night market but you can bargain with the sellers. its better to buy your souvenirs at the old town area of hoi an :D",
          "Can only find these things in Asia. Always bustling and busy with visitors and even locals.\nIncredible night market with things from clothes, to toys, accessories and an abundance of atomic food you can smell from a mile away. Definitely a stop by. Washrooms are also available",
          "Most amazing site ever, all of the boats were alight, winderful",
          "Fun to walk around but it gets old pretty quick. The lanterns are beautiful.",
          "Awesome night market. Must visit place in vietnam. Lots of option for shopping, food etc. You need lot of time for this place as there so many things that time will always be less. Best thing is to stay in Hoi An overnight and enjoy the night life and market.",
          "It's nice place to visit, but it's really crowded and I come not in the weekend.\nI cannot imagine if it's weekend...\nIt's quite cheap for the food I've come for dinner.",

          "Pretty nice and beautiful with all the lights and a couple of nice restaurants.",

          "Touristy sure but fun night our wondering the streets, found a great seafood bbq right down at the far end of the market. Best dish was the stir fried razor clams, cheapest too!!",
          "Fun place to spend your nights in Hoi An if you have nothing else to do. Dont expect any unique shopping to happen here. Very typical products are on sale here.",
          "I love this place so much, it was really beautiful at night. With the colourful lanterns hanging everywhere, it just made me want to stay longer there to enjoy the night view.",
          "Beautiful. Nice food. Find the sticky banana guy.",
          "Bustling market, be prepared to haggle for goods. Open pretty late, Sunday evening until 11ish and Monday evening until 10ish it was pretty busy.",
          "Amazing. Words fail to express or describe what an enchanting place this is. Awesome that one can only walk or cycle in the market area. Great food. Mellow relaxed eateries along the river. A must when visiting Vietnam. Love the fact that \u2026",
          "This is a must see for anyone visiting Vietnam! Yes, this is extremely touristy and you will see more international guests than locals, but it is beautiful and well worth a one night trip. Bring cash cause not everyone accepts cards. For \u2026",
          "Amazing display of lantern and lively market place. Must visit when in Hoi An and Danang.",
          "The Lunar calender celebrations and Old Town lit up with hundreds of lanterns was spectacular",
          "It's a dingy night market with vendors selling tourist souvenirs and cheap counterfeit goods, below average street food, a few overpriced bars nearby. Pretty much exactly what you expect from a night market in the middle of a very large tourist trap. But you're not going to visit Hoi An without going there at least once. Five stars!",
          "So much to see and a a great place to greet presents for your loved ones back home. The lanterns are wonderful to see.",
          "Best night market in Hoi An city.",
          "Nice friendly place and unique experience of Vietnam.",
          "Plenty to see and eat. Lights magical with reflections in the water. Typical market stalls with a few interesting ones as well. We visited on two nights, the second one to eat at Morning Glory as we had a number of people recommend it. Also \u2026",
          "Lovely foods :)",
          "Good atmosphere, even if they usually all sale similar products",
          "A little town with latern street. Love it",
          "So  many people so many shops and so many street food. It can be a pleasure to watch the tourists and to see the beautiful night view.",
          "Ok night market, good for a walk around. Don't expect variety in the souvenirs or food. Can bargain",
          "Not altogether impressed with the offerings at the night market. However its a reasonable place to go just to get a feel of the expected tourist trinkets on offer.",
          "Always the same tourist stalls but the food stalls are Great",
          "Lively and colourful. Lots of souvenirs and food, local delicacies. Beautiful river side.",
          "Loved the vibe there. Avoid going on a full moon night when it\u2019s flooded with tourists.\n\nThe street side bar and food was amazing too. Watch out for them. They play good music and serve the same drinks served in other bars at much cheaper \u2026",
          "It is so different from which I visited many years ago. Lots of tourism services, so crowded that u hardly ever see anything from an acient town like it was before. The good sign I could see there is that... no chaos, it seemd to be quite safe place even at night time.",
          "Nice night market with a lot food options and massage shops around",
          "Very nice ag night.. good food options",
          "This is a beautiful place but that beauty is seriously diminished by the pushy sales people trying to get you to buy things, boat rides, or come into restaurants.  It gets really annoying really fast. We did enjoy a delicious pomelo salad at Morning Glory on the balcony under the lanterns. I think weekdays are less crowded.",
          "The night market is full of life and great snacks. Don\u2019t miss watching the sun set over the water with your beers and food. You will find many exotic foods at this market too and you can have a foot massage while eating your rolled ice \u2026",
          "Nice place but got too \"touristic\" and kinda lost its soul",
          "Totally worth a visit, great ambience, good food and amazing boat ride. All the feels of an old town",
          "The lighted lanterns at night is so nice. Choose a restaurant and have a nice dinner while enjoying the view.",
          "Not much different compared to the every day markets on the river front.",
          "Come early because the shops start closing by 8:30pm but restaurants n street food vendors are available till late. Amazing street food, decent veg options like vietnamese pizza, coconut sweets etc.",
          "You will have different feeling between day and night , both of day and night are very beautiful",
          "It is a great place to check out and see many of the local wares. Also a lot of great street food. Just be ready to face a massive crowd if you are here during tourist season or go on a weekend night.",
          "Really liked the night market, soo many stalls. They kind of repeat themselves with what they sell. Be careful when buying the lanterns when I got home and opened it, the design looked nothing like the one I wanted. Looked rushed and not \u2026",
          "I was a bit disappointed by this market. Maybe my expectations were too high. Definitely not the best market I've seen so far and at 21:30 they start packing by 10 it's all over. Not much appreciated sorry....",
          "A small night market by the standards of night markets in other Asian cities. Enough to occupy an hour and take a break from the camera that hoi an demands at every moment. The stalls are repetitive with little variety, but there is some cheap food around",
          "Was nice walking along the streets, taking the boat ride and setting the paper lanterns into the water for luck, street food, bars, leather goods shops, silk shops and so much more. Most places closed before 11pm so advice to start earlier if you love shopping.",
          "Lots of good food and shops. Beautiful at night with lanterns and live music.",
          "Incredible atmosphere, frantic pase, loud, fun,great shopping.great place to go and .see",
          "Surprisingly small and narrow place. However, every single menu I tried was just awesome. Great performance per cost.",
          "Been here twice. The whole street along the river is fulfilled with many kinds of street food and souvenirs. The night view is likely with colourful sparkling light. And yes, with many people too.",
          "Bustling place full of street foods and souvenir. Lots of riverside bars too.",
          "120000 vdn fee of entrance in the village....Nice places for couples \n....too much for tourist. But really suggestive with all this lantern everywhere.\nNice dinner at foodmarket\nNot TO much expensive the souvenir shops. I didn't have a boat \u2026",
          "It's really fascinating to see their cultural hand made items being displayed and sold, it's really amazing, you have such a wide variety of street foods and items to purchase, great experience.",
          "Beautiful at night. Great selection of street food and restaurants. Busy but great atmosphere.",
          "Be careful what you eat. I got Bali belly. Still have now on third day.\nVery interezting their street stalls and variety of food. Great night atmosphere.",
          "A beautiful and dangerous disappointment. The ambiance above is unique, the lights and building absolutely lovely and the river and bridges breath-taking. The vendors seemed sorry and tired of tourists. The prices a lot higher than Cambodia \u2026",
          "Market is fine and nice to visit. It is in the middle of the city center, so no need to skip the market. Don\u2019t expect too much of the stuff the people on the market are selling; it is a lot of the same. But definitely try a banana crape with Nutella for 40k!",
          "Get crazy trying as many street food as you can. All very tasty and cheap.",
          "Heaps to see, taste and explore.",
          "The evening events with lanterns were enjoyable and are  worth checking out. Night markets and the smell of the food was amazing",
          "Nice town where the most place I like",
          "Lots of local street food to try. Also restaurants,massages and souvenir places.",
          "It looks lovely at night with all the  lanterns and boats cruising along the river.  Lots of people enjoying the scenery and the shops.",
          "Great atmosphere, great places for kids but very crowded",
          "Very clean city. Beautiful with all the lanterns!",
          "Definitely worth a visit when in Vietnam. Friendly atmosphere and plenty of activities happening. Easy to mix shopping, eating, bars and just people watching if that's your thing. I'm sure there are cheaper markets around, but the lights and vibe makes this a must do",
          "Beautiful place to walk,take a boat tour (15 m\u1ecbn for 5 us dollar).  Very crowded!",
          "Lovely little place to explore the street food and street vendors..",
          "Ohhh.  I still miss those yummy banana pancakes . Was in love with the lanterns they were selling",
          "There were interesting food options along the side of the market. The market itself was mostly a collection of souvenirs and some sellers were a bit aggressive, walking after female tourists hassling them.",
          "I'm in love with this town at night.\n\nThis entire area is super touristy, but it has this romantic charm that I've never experienced before. You can get a little table right on edge of River and eat. You can take millions of beautiful photos \n\nIf I wanted to go on a romantic outing, this would be the place. It's absolutely lovely.",
          "A must experience spot in Hoi An. The boats on the river with their lanterns is just magical.",
          "Great place to visit in Hoi An. It is very touristy and the range of food available isn\u2019t huge, or particularly tasty, but it\u2019s a fun, lively atmosphere and makes for a nice evening stroll. I\u2019d recommend eating at a local restaurant nearby.",
          "The night market is located across the river from the old town. There are a good selection of stalls and of course lots of street food. We went earlier in the evening as to avoid the crowds as it can be quite busy later in the evening. Overall a nice market...very typical of the markets in the area.",
          "Good but you need to discount to at least 50%",
          "th\n\nThe 3 stars only relate to whats on offer at the night market, if you want lanterns, this is the place to buy them, however apart from food, there is very little worth buying at these markets. However worth a walk for the festive atmosphere.",
          "Very pretty but the same as most of Vietnam.",
          "It's a must see Ancient city while visiting Danang.\nLocation - Hoi An, 30-40 minutes scooter ride from the main city center of Danang.",
          "A lot of people but still nice in 2 times come back. HA night market is the small town of lights. Try some street food they're better than restaurant and have local taste. Cao Lau, Thit Nuong is best choice :\")",
          "Great place for food and souvenirs , very lively .",
          "Nice scenery.  Night market a lot stall but not much variety of products. Remember bargain the price.",
          "It was ok. Food variety is limited, the crowd during peak time is quite something. Not really my cup of tea",
          "Nice place to walk around and try different street food. I'm vegetarian and still found quite a few things I could eat - Mostly sweet and coconut based, but still delicious. You can get a veggie banh mi and ask for no cheese or mayo if \u2026",
          "Nice place but a little bit dirty",
          "The best shopping place in Hoi an",
          "Amazing view especially at night and on full moon day.\nYou can purchase many things from local market at very good price.\nYou can also find food everywhere",
          "Hoi An always looks great at night.\nMassive variety of goods and fruit and vegetables. Pleasant atmosphere. Many many cafes and food outlets selling mostly local foods. As always at markets in Vietnam ( and other Asian countries) beware of paying too much.",
          "Great place to try some of the local delights or vuy somr souvenirs. Definitely you need to walk around here if you are in Hoi An. Cheers!",
          "Good food and relatively laid back.",
          "Amazing, full of lights - lanterns , good food and atmosphere \ud83e\udd29",
          "The market is located in the island just crossing the Bridge of Lights. It's a very busy road with souvenirs and food stalls but is missing all the Hoi An atmosphere from the other side of the river.",
          "Smallish market, just one long street. Prices are ofcourse inflated compared to a couple hundred meters away, but pretty and worth a visit",
          "Fun place to walk around, shop for crafts and fun souvenirs. Great street food on the sides. Easy to get by with English. Can get very crowded.",
          "Overcrowded, buildings were covered by vendors wares. Every space was occupied by some  souvenir shop. Couldn't see anything of the old town.\nThe latern boat trip was very relaxing and worth doing.\nWe ate at the Morning Glory restaurant . Quality was good and price reasonable. Overall recommend the trip.",
          "Cities always have 2 sides, one during the day, and the other during the night. Hoi An market in the night us beautiful",
          "The market is sooo peacefull. I recommend this if you are looking for some peaceful place.",
          "Wonderful town, excellent to explore on foot.",
          "A must go to place to round up your trip to Hoi An. Lots of souvenirs and local delights to try... Beautiful Instagramable spots",
          "We enjoyed our time at the Hoi An Night Market. It has a little bit of everything in a small village. \n\nThe street food was delicious and their restaurant options were aplenty. We went to Morning Glory and loved their food! The streets are \u2026",
          "Full of life and lots of delicious food and things you can buy that you would not find anywhere else..loved it..also the people are welcoming and very warming.",
          "Just some random little stands selling stuff and some nice food. Sadly not at all what we expected based on stories from the hostel",
          "One of most sort after place near Da Nang. The place is film for foreigners. Best time to visit in the evening. Full of lanterns everywhere. Good places to eat and shop",
          "Lots of nice little knick knacks to snatch up as souvenirs to commemorate your visit to Hoi An city. Make sure to haggle prices and try and get yourself a bargain. Or at least to not get ripped off!",
          "Very small area, expensive food.. You will be wasting your time.",
          "Lovely in the night, but masses of people",
          "Still a vibrant night market no matter how many times I visit. Should go at least once if you're in Hoi An.",
          "Great tonight the rain held off and it was not crowded!",
          "Nice to see. But not so nice for buying...most of the price are twice or 3 times more expensive than in Hanoi city!!",
          "Great market. So much to see. Great atmosphere",
          "Hoi An is so so beautiful. The markets have such a beautiful vibe and great feel to them",
          "This is one of the greatest attractions in Da Nang. Many foreigners and crowded always. There are plenty of restaurants and shops to buy local items, souvenir, bag etc. You need to do some bargaining. Also it is best to go in the evening so you can see the beauty of this place with amazing combination of colorful lights.",
          "High prices, low quality. Disappointed.",
          "Very busy but a great place to pick up souvenirs and good vibe",
          "So pretty! The market has lots of food and souvenirs stalls",
          "We enjoyed the holiday lights and activities for TET.",
          "Very cool, right on the river. Nightly lantern lighting around 6pm. Just a bit small, but has lots of souvenirs and clothes for cheap. Many restaurants a long the river that were a bit more pricey, but good food. Street food also available and very tasty.",
          "A beautiful, touristy night market that has a specifi H\u00f4i An look with shops with lanterns or food. We had a good grilled octopus there. The shop owners asks 20kVND to take a picture with the lanterns.",
          "It's quite a nice place, with many restaurants and cafes. However do be warned that it can get quite crowded at night. Should you want a less crowded experience do come at around 9pm before the weather starts heating up around 11am. Be prepared to bargain your way to a deal in the many shops as some of their prices are steep",
          "Coloring amazing place",
          "Huge choice of interesting and tasty street food. Masses of tourists though.",
          "Great atmosphere, plenty of food and goods.",
          "We loved this place but felt it was a little bit all over the place. Compared to the night market in Da Nang, this place had less options for food and all the food stands were spread along the whole market. We felt that maybe have all the \u2026",
          "Very oppressing. Not a place to see as a tourist. Natives ate very upset if you dont buy anything. Have seen better attitude in asia. Dont waste your time...",
          "It was ok, too crowded for me so I do not take any picture. The people are nice but then again, because there are too many tourist it gets super hot when you have only walk for about 5 minutes.\n\nI still recommend them for first timer to Hoi \u2026",
          "Full of lots and lots of same same stalls, nice food, but every stall basically sells the same.\nVery busy so expect that.\nSurprising starts to closes about 10pm (ish)which is quite early for Vietnam.\n\nAgain, has nice food, you could prob get cheaper food just around the corner. But then again, you would be alone.",
          "Quite something, very colorful and vibrant night market",
          "A bloody madhouse! Far too many people. No fun at all.",
          "Amazing scenes after sundown. Shopping and food is great.",
          "It\u2019s a nice easy going market. No one is pushing and shoving and vendors don\u2019t really bother you like in other markets. The roads are shut to cars which is nice and allow pedestrians to take over the streets. (You can ride your bicycle) \u2026",
          "It's really beautiful place. Especially if you go there at night. One of the cities that you have to visit in the world.",
          "Being alittle tourist here. You get to shop and buy some local products. See some old relic, like the japanese bridge, you also see some newer side cafe where you can enjoy some coffee. And visit mr bA",
          "A really romantic and nice market",
          "Must do if staying in Hoi An. Between this nightmarket and a lot of the artisan shops around I found that Hoi An was the beat place to buy souvenirs in Vietnam. Although a lot of the stuff is unique a lot of the stuff is also quite similar so make sure to haggle at different stalls to get the best price!",
          "Awesome! Very large selection of food, clothing, jewelry, leather handbags etc...",
          "Extremely bustling and touristy. H\u1ed9i An is best experienced at night, as the old town lights up with lanterns and the bridges are illuminated. The night market is on the island across from the center of the old town, and it's worth stopping \u2026",
          "Beautiful place but overcrowded and the sellers are a little annoying.",
          "Good food on the market. Lots of things to eat",
          "Nice market within walkable distance to the river and boat rides.",
          "A great place to take some pictures in the evening with some cool locations",
          "Just a little market selling trinket, lanterns and some food. The food was a little overpriced, some stalls had better skewers were better than others",
          "Street foods, restaurants, musics and tourists are the key elements make up the whole night market. Unforgettable holiday.",
          "Very beautiful night market with cheap food and souvenirs.",
          "Really nice. Take a boat ride. Well worth it.",
          "Great experience! So much fun in the heart of Hoi An!",
          "Lovely place with delicious local food and coffee.",
          "Nice. Very beautiful with the lanterns. Food is reasonably priced!",
          "Something for everyone and many shops stay open late too in the old town. Really a very relaxed and safe area in general.",
          "too many people.. too hot..\nespecially with children.. it was really hard work.\n\nbut the market itself was great.",
          "Great energy at this market, food was good and walking around by the river was very refeeshing",
          "It looks awesome , place to click many pics with night vision. But it is not as cheap as people say. Place to roam and enjoy cool evening . busy street with many many lights",
          "Tourist street, some vendors whose business is not so good can be rude to tourists. \nGenerally food and souvenirs  are pricey and tourists just visit to look see. Not many people buy items.",
          "A nice Place  To stay and spend  some Time.  besutiful  sceneery with all the  Lampions in the Street  and river",
          "Wow! I loved Hoi An so much and visiting the Night Market was definitely a highlight.\n\nI wish I knew shopping was so huge here because I wouldve brought an empty luggage bag with me. You can get some incredible quality clothes, suits, bags, \u2026",
          "The place was crazy, teeming with tourists. The sellers harassed everyone and the produce was pretty generic. If you want small souvenirs and you like flashing lights, sure, go ahead. But none of it is artisanal or genuinely Vietnamese.",
          "LOVED HOI AN NIGHT MARKET. must see in Hoi An. The lanterns are incredible. You can find vegan food if you search around. Not super easy to find though. Great night out.",
          "Colorful, has lots of thing to buy and eat. It's a fun place to move around when the sun is down and the weather is bearable.",
          "Well...a good place to have a walk, eat street food and shopping if you like to do bargains and enjoy with that, for me was exhausting u can even get almost the half of the price of some things. U can find a lot of souvenirs and things to \u2026",
          "Indian Sarojini ! superb place !",
          "Great for little souvenir trinkets and things, and remember, bartering is perfectly acceptable here! \ud83d\ude04",
          "So much fun and can be easily done all in one night. It\u2019s a lot bigger than i expected. Tons of food carts to try out but you just have to go around and find it. Come Hungry and most likely you\u2019ll be leaving happy :)",
          "This place is awesome! It\u2019s defiantly must visit place. So beautiful. You might want to visit here around 4-5pm since many street vendors open up that time and lanterns are on when it gets dark. Be aware of big crowds. I never seen that \u2026",
          "It is a great place to take in the sights, eat some good food and walk. The lanterns, smells and bustling night life is fun. Make sure to try some of the street food!",
          "One of the nicest markets i've seen in vietnam so far. Specially the streed food walk, worth even just a look.",
          "At times can get very busy and packed but other then that a good vibe. Just needs to clean up the area.",
          "Unique sight especially at night and definitely worth visiting.",
          "Really nice but a little bit crowded. Totally recommended to visit in your visit to Hoi An.\nPrices are a little bit higher than in the rest of the city during the day though.",
          "Good vibes and enjoyed the live music at bars. \nOf course it's a bit touristic even as the prices. But than again..",
          "A beautiful place with structures built around 17-18 century AD of Chinese architecture and streets covers with lanterns which look amazing in the night. It gets really crowded with tourists all around the place",
          "Full or life, activities, food, smoothies, etc ! Just next to the pub street if you want to have a drink after.",
          "it was a big night market than I expected.\nmy wife and me went there last night.\nwe found so many food carts and sovinier shops.\nand beautiful view from bridge is optional",
          "Alot of shops and great scenery",

          "Amazing... Magic starts after the sun sets..",
          "Beautiful place to visit. You will see beautiful lanterns hanging all around. The place is lively with wide range of restaurants. The boat ride in night market is amazing",
          "This is really the place to see In Da Nang area, and totally different than on day time. Worth to visit",
          "It's a generic east Asian night market. Tourist tat and some tasty street food (We didn't try the frog or octopus - but they looked good!). Go around closing time at 10ish for some last minute bargains and a much less hectic atmosphere when the coach loads of tourists have left.",
          "Very cute place but very touristc. The local are haggling a bit  too much",
          "One of the most amazing place on Earth.",
          "Great area and restaurants and food stalls",
          "Really packed with tourists and people trying to either sell you something or drag you into a bar. Despite this, it is really beautiful and a unique sight. Quite large as well.",
          "Great place to visit for people having great bargaining skills. Food street has great options to eat. Live band and the food adds to its beauty",
          "Very crowded place,  very interesting market. But you have to walk a lot",
          "The markets are much like other markets you would of already seen in Vietnam really. Lots of people selling the same stuff. The river down the middle though is quite a nice boat ride at night, they even give you a free candle to float in the water as your riding.",
          "Nice night scenary. But much effort needed to take care of the heritage and order of the tourist place.",
          "This was adam experience for the lanterns, lights and atmosphere. The shots are all identical selling the same stuff and telling you why there's is best quality. Eventually it just became over whelming and we left.",
          "Typical Asian night market touristy stuff. But the laterns are a beautiful sight.",
          "Orange Spa Foot massage was really good",
          "I think there can be more things alot of repetitive shop, need to be watch full of the change, paid 500000 vnd for a pancake that cost 20000 and got back a 30000vnd change the lady had to stay there for a while for the person to realise that the scam did not work.",
          "Interesting but very touristy, you will be approached to buy boat rides, lanterns you name it's here. Because of the number of tourists it, for me, has lost the spiritual significance of the lantern ceremony and has gone from monthly to daily.",
          "beautiful place to rest!) and to eat!\ud83d\ude48",
          "Good food stalls everywhere! \ud83d\ude00",
          "Cool place but it's old. Kinda sad feeling.\nOvercrown with peoples. Too much tourist.",
          "I liked it for the chaos, liked it for the fanfare and festive nature, I liked it for the drinks and food. It was only an issue when it came to crowds being so dense people were running into each other. Very little ac and a lot of cheap \u2026",
          "You can find everything there and even at the 3rd visit you will find something new",
          "Very beautiful place at night.  with a lot of gift shops that is of no interest to me.",
          "Lanterns are pretty cheap here but beware of the quality. I was getting a bulk purchase from them and when I was checking the lanterns, there were cuts on the fabric for several pieces. Always check before you pay!",
          "Great Streetfood. Prices vary greatly. Usual market good being sold. Go a little later to avoid mass crowds. Great BBQ grill street food place at the very end.",
          "This market was great atmosphere with lots of things to do, you can buy souvenir as lanterns, street foods, beers...or just enjoy a drink at the nice conner & experience colorful street!",
          "Good mix of food and souvenirs. Most of the night markets in Vietnam have the same items. Just remember to bargain so you don't get ripped off. Less busy then other night markers I have been to so that was nice.",
          "Beautiful multi colored lanterns on the rivers.",
          "Great variety of fresh food and fruits \ud83d\ude01",
          "The lantern-lit nightlife of Hoi An is both delightfully magical and a tailoring wizard haven. Try to opt for less touristy months to visit, as the market is less crowded and the vendors are far more ailing to barter. There are an abundance \u2026",
          "Very crowded but a great atmosphere and the lanterns lit up look beautiful.",
          "More lights, higher prices. Buy the same thing during the day & it's cheaper.",
          "This ancient city market bursts with even more life at night where people are just seen everywhere shopping, eating and exploring every nook and cranny for bargains and unusual eats.",
          "a great place. if possible I\u2019ll visit again. lots of pretty places.",
          "Very beautiful! Especially in full moon! Very recommended!",

          "Food is delicous and cheap \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Ancient City with rich cultural places. A must go place especially at night if you are in Danang.",
          "Really liked it! So many colours and amazingly good street food. So far the best place I have eaten in the whole country.",
          "Nice place to walk around the river, lantern street, not so noisy from the bar, beautiful boats lights and good place for couple\u2019s evening walk.",
          "Make sure you ask price before you sit down for food! Tourist zone. Make sure you know how to barter too! Beautiful at night though. Don't pay over 25 for a beer.",
          "A tourist trap. There are no much local things to see or local foods to eat. Most stalls sell similar things. The price is so much inflated. Nothing authentic about this place.",
          "Want those lantern photos that everybody comes to Hoi An for? You will find that here. Nice place to snack on little street food dishes.",
          "Great for souvenirs, try to haggle a little bit. Also great to grab some quick bites of nearly any Vietnamese market food you can think off, rolled ice, Banh Xeo, pork skewers, frog legs, etc.",
          "Nice town but too many tourists. Would give it 5 star if not for the crowd.",
          "Colorful. Unusual foods on the street.",
          "Magnificent places especially at night when they put on the lanterns",

          "Just chilled in and went for lunch at 3PM... I was 10PM when i return back... Awesome place..",
          "Lots of fun booths, but beware, they don't like it if you try to take pictures with stuff. Guess you have to buy it first!",
          "You have to go once you get to Danang.\nI recommend you take a slow look at it rather than a short time.\nWalk. If you're tired, massage your feet.\nIt's fun haggling over the price when you buy",
          "Very pretty with all the lanterns on the buildings and the boats",
          "Beautiful old buildings, this is mostly a shopping center during the day. The ambiance at night is excellent but during the day, the sun is harsh and there are few trees for shade.",
          "Pretty good place to visit and eat street food, the view and atmosphere is fantastic. Best time to start at 7 pm, don\u2019t buy anything too expensive since there are plenty of cheaper place in Danang.",
          "Such a cool market, a dream for street food lovers. Prices are incredibly affordable with lots of restaurants offering beer for only 3000-5000 VND per glass\n\nThe lights are lovely to see, especially if you are here for the lantern festival",

          "Great food! Cool shops all over, heavy tourist population, sick atmosphere!!",

          "nice place you can visit, but too noisy, every minute you can hear horn sound...",
          "So much beautiful at this place nice to  take photos at night & so much lantern i never seen befor.",
          "Place is like being on the Hong Kong subway at rush hour. There's no mystic, those days are over. It's a conveyor belt of Asian tourism, constant solicitation and uncleanliness. Wish I had the opportunity to visit these places 20-30 years ago. One day, two tops.",
          "Awesome and beautiful place to be.",
          "Beautiful night life with lights and local cuisine",
          "For night markets there prices are quite extortion I know they know tourist pay but charging 30kdong for a chicken skewer or per kilo of watermelon is ridiculous, fridge magnets where cheaper in the airport than these markets, bit of greed around because of tourism as rest of Vietnam is super cheap!!",
          "Bleh. Very basic. Saw nothing I wanted. Nearly all the booths were the same. Overpriced and not unique, I'd skip...",
          "Those who like ancient product will like hoi an. Its trulyan old quaryer town",
          "nice hand craft, but you need to be smart to strike more discount",

          "Night time photography is great along the river. Haggle your way through if you're planning to shop here",

          "Pretty cool place to walk around.",
          "Pedestrian enclave. Calm. Friendly. No hawkers. Restaurants good value + service.",
          "Very busy, but worth a quick trip just to see.",
          "Kind of a tourist trap but fight your way to the scenic sights. Beautiful ancient homes and incredible temples. Be sure to stay past dark to watch the lanterns on the water.",
          "Very enjoy and the beautiful city to visit.",
          "Vibrant with all kinds of foods. Btry the grilled octopus, just delicious!",
          "Bargaining is fun if you enjoy it, the lanterns on the full moon are really nice but all the stalls are the same, lots of tourist tat.",
          "The night market is near the ancient town and closes early around 08:00p.m. It includes wide range of things like local foods, souvenirs, and massages. A good place to discover but always crowded. Be careful of personal belongings just in case.",
          "Beautiful place. I can walk hours here. The evening lights create a romantic ambience",

          "Come to Hoi An ancient city at around 1830 to enjoy the street food, get a drink and emjoy the riverside night view decorated with traditional lanterns. You can also get on a boat and place a lotus candle light on the river to wish for good luck.",
          "Great market but beware, they will charge u 300% of what the locals pay. Always barter half the price at least, they will say no. Walk away & they will call u back at the price u negotiate.",

          "Beautiful town. Festival nights are magical with the paper lanterns. Lots of good food around aswell.",
          "Nothing special if you've already seen a few markets in Vietnam. The river is very pretty at night when it's full of boats and lanturns however. \n\nIf you're feel brave and hungry, try the bbq frogs! \nSome of the food may seem expensive, but remember that most prices have some wriggle room if your haggling skills are on point.",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "On the day we visited it hadn't stopped raining all day. People were purchasing throw away plastic macs and were anxious to take cover, hence the crowded interior. The building appeared to be long and narrow and the wooden interior was very dark. There was a large poem board",
          "It seems like this would be an interesting stop, but like most things in Hoi An, it was totally packed. We did a quick walk through, but most of the back of the building was a gift shop. It was just ok.",
          "This might be your first stop. The inner courtyard is beautiful. Make sure to read the rags to riches fairy tale of the owner.",
          "No, this isn\u2019t a \u201cmust see\u201d, \u201cimpressive\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d. It\u2019s a tiny house where you can walk though the ground level (a couple of rooms and a small courtyard) then exit the other side. I visited alone and although there were staff milling around, no one could be bothered to give",
          "If you are a history buff it\u2019s worth a stop. I was particularly intrigued with how they shuttered the store front.",
          "Don't know why this place is getting any good reviews. There isn't much to see (you can't go upstairs at all), the gift shop dominates and the back was full of scooters - hardly ancient! If you want to see an old Hoi An trader's house go to the ceramics museum - skip the",
          "Old house with nicely displayed history located at the Heart of the Ancient Town. Entry fee is VND22,000. Well worth a visit.",
          "Old house of a merchant from the past retained with its many artifacts. Interesting place with glimpses of the past.",
          "In the Old Town of Hoi An, there are several old houses, now open as tourist sites. For me, the most interesting area is the interior courtyard, where the house has an area open to the sky.",
          "Definitely worth a visit to learn about the past, the living, the customs and the present... Interesting surviver of annual floods. History of many generations. One of only a few houses of that age and style in Hoi An that can be visited...",
          "More interesting on outside but not alot to see inside Only visited as using up tourist voucher books",
          "An old gofar. That's interesting. What's more interesting is the river floods most years. Last year it was 3 meters high. There is a wall that shows the height of the floods. Seems like floods happen every 2 years. If I missed the house my day would not have been ruined.",
          "The house is worth a walk through for the historic architectural and structural workings. The family is more than happy to sell you a table cloth or other embroidered work done in house.",
          "You need to have an entry ticket for this place. It was highly commercialized with overpriced products sold inside. Also not a great attraction.",
          "This ancient house on the river bank is beautifully detailed and maintained, and one of the better examples of how much wealth there was in the 16th and 17th century in this city. Intricately carved woodwork throughout, and a lovely central courtyard with gorgeous garden to let",
          "This was the third ancient house we went to in Hoi An, and by far the best - there was english signage and interesting artifacts around the house.",
          "Another possibility of a five-stops ticket. The house is small and often crowded but is worth a little patience. Most important is that the house is really preserved and not rebuilt. No wonder that it is mostly photographed and its pictures are all over Hoi An. You can choose",
          "An interesting old merchant house that is known for being constantly flooded, but having been built with good materials, it withstood the test of time and water. There are some interesting facts you can read by yourself, but definitely would be more interesting with a tour guide.",
          "Visited this ancient house while on walking tour. An amazing old house to see the flood lines on wall and the way it was built. Amazing.",
          "Tan Ky is definitely worth a visit once in Hoi An. There's more to this beautiful small town than tailors and lamps - the history behind the doors of this old house is fascinating.",
          "Like most tourist places, they are more interested in selling you items at the house than sharing info. Our guide gave us some info, but he was in a hurry to finish the tour and get rid of us",
          "Our walking tour took us here. Interest to visit with the guide giving information about the house and the area. Only needs a quick visit but worth a look",
          "If your in Hoi An and don' know much about its history, you'll learn so much from members of the original family who owned this house.",
          "This could be a great place to see but the tourism set-up is bad. Trying to rush lots of people through, someone gives a very quick, undefiled and sometimes hard-to-understand talk. Then they spend a longer time trying to sell you souvenirs.",
          "We purchased 6 tickets for entry to houses. There are different sites to choose from. Out of all of them, this one is a must. Upon entry we elected to have a host tell us about the history of the house. The host explained that the house foundation is marble and when the typhoon",
          "The parts of this house the have been preserved are very impressive but once the entrance hall and large gift shop at the rear are taken off, there isn\u2019t a great de to see. There are much better uses of the the Old Town \u2018visiting coupons\u2019 than this.",
          "The survival of these old structures are quite amazing, built with weather changes in mind, very interesting.",
          "This really is a very special house that was once owned by a well known Vietnamese merchant family. Have one of your Old Town heritage tickets handy, you'll not get in without one although it looked like you could pay with cash as an alternative. Its been very well preserved",
          "The house was rebuilt in the 18th century. It is built over 2 floors and 2 inter connecting houses. The architecture is split between Chinese And Japanese wood. This was a merchant's house and the ground floor was for stock that was to be sold immediately while the second floor",
          "The Old House Tan Ky in Hoi An has left us with full of impressions... Since generations, generations and still more generations this venerable property, constructed in Fengshui architectural style, has survived, without any harm for the wooden construction, the many frequent",
          "The interior was interesting. The basic building style can easily be seen by the wooden frame. No fancy ceilings, mouldings. Just the bare necessities in a home which has lasted for a long time.",
          "It is probably my favorite monument I visited while in Hoi An. Nothing breathtaking to be expected, apart maybe the watermarks for the past floods. But the house is well preserved and give a feel for the glorious past of this once major trading port.",
          "Personally, I did not find this house a very worthwhile experience, it was incredibly small; literally just walk in one door and out the other. In addition having travelled to many asian countries in the past it was definitely not something new to see. Also we had a guide from",
          "This old house is preserved and one of the cornerstone houses of the preserved district of Hoi An. Various flood levels are marked on the walls. I found it so fascinating that this house has been able to withstand everything for centuries and is still in great shape.",
          "If you only see two things in Hoi An it should be Tan Ky old house and the Japanese Covered Bridge! The Tan Ky house requires buying a ticket to Hoi An old town! This ticket can be bought at the tourist information boths (there are several in old town). One is allowed to see the",
          "Since we stayed in a beautiful historic hotel in town that looks like this (but much nicer), i could have taken a pass on this museum. i think there are other options on the list that would be better to see if you purchase the multiple pass. while it had interesting character,",
          "Built two centuries ago by an Vietnamese family and preserved through seven generations. The roof structure shows Japanese and Chinese influences on the architecture. It is a typical Vietnamese house with living room, centre open air area and kitchen at the back. The living",
          "It was nice to see and hear a little about the history of the area and the family. If you are short on time, this was a very quick stop that was informative. The lucky coin was an inexpensive way of walking away with a souvenir of the place. In fact all my kids wanted one and",
          "The host gave us a quick history of the old house and then take us to the next station which she try to sell us some coins and embroidery. The whole house is made of dark woods so it is dark and extremely crowded. too many tourists in and out.",
          "Really interesting to go in here and look around and see how people lived and still do in this very old house. Looking at the furniture and style fascinating",
          "When you purchase the entrance ticket to Ancient City, there are 5 ticket stubs which allows you to choose 5 different checkpoints to visit within the ancient city. Japanese Bridge is a Must Visit and the rest of the checkpoints include Old House of Tan Ky. Nothing much to see,",
          "You only get to see the downstairs of this house as the family still live upstairs. It\u2019s quite dark and lots of people are let in together so it gets a little crowded and it is easy to get washed through with the crowd. We were part of a tour group and the old woman who was",
          "The house was nice, but the visit was mostly about them trying to sell us drapes and embroidery: this should be changed",
          "Amazing house, in my title I say its amazing its still standing, but however when you see the workmanship and the solid materials then there is your answer. This house is still occupied by the 7th generation of the original occupants. There are many family pictures on the",
          "Nothing like a family business run from the family home when the house is the business. I thought this place was really cool. We enjoyed a drink, the commentary and the purchase of a souvenir. When we visited it was very busy and a bit steamy as it was raining outside but the",
          "We love seeing the old ways people lived. This home is in great shape and super well preserved. Check out the FLOOD level marks in the back of home.",
          "It is only a small attraction, but a nice part of historic Hoi An. We found it to be an interesting house, preserved well, with staff to explain how the merchandise is hurriedly hauled upstairs during times of flooding.",
          "This old house is OK. There\u2019s a lot of dark wood so it seems a bit dark and dreary. It\u2019s also very crowded as it has a good reputation but I feel that it falls a bit short. Hoi An regularly suffers from flooding and the one thing I did find interesting was that they have kept a",
          "Its supposed to be one of the oldest houses in Hoi An. Apparently the family still live upstairs as the place floods regularly. Interesting to go inside.",
          "You can't miss this old house in Hoi An ancient town. The location is by the river and near the restaurant row. Tan Ky Merchant house is a nice stop to explore the old house in that era.",
          "You will need to buy the tourist ticket to access the inside of this house, these are available at the beginning of the Ancient Town. The house is clearly old and does contain many original features so worth looking at.",
          "Tan Ky Merchant House is a nice stop. This is an example of a family being relatively well-off from that era. That they are able to keep the abode in much the same fashion is nice. You are able to see much of the first level, the second level of is off limits and still in use",
          "A must see when in Hoi An. Brings centuries of history close to today. The markings of the flooding gives you a very good idea on how much the water actually covers when the area is flooded. They needed to close the old town of Hoi An due to flooding just the week after we left!",
          "Nice way to escape the heat while walking around the old town. Super cool to walk in to the original old house. You can get nice pictures of this from the other side of the river. It\u2019s a bit surprising to see the water levels of the past floods which have been marked near the",
          "This house is quite spectacular, stretching as it does from street to street. A daughter of the family will conduct you around (and try to sell you amulets), and it's a rare and lovely thing to be able to sit down with family members in the home, and take in all the detail and",
          "An ancient Chinese house continuously lived in by 8 generations of the same family. Wooden structure with antique decorations and furniture still intact and gorgeous intricate mother-of -pearl inlaid columns. When the house floods every year to heights of up to 3m, the family",
          "I had decided to visit this house again from Italy when I was planning my trip to Vietnam. A family member will receive you and you will sit on the beautiful wooden chairs and pearl entrance by serving tea. Then he will learn the architecture of the house. The ride is also very",
          "This merchant's house is rather interesting, as it has survived multiple floods and is lived in. The levels in the year of flooding is marked on a wall. We were told by our guide, that some in the family (now into 7th generation) still lives in this home. They move the relics",
          "Look back several centuries to see how people lived here in Hoi An. This well preserved house is a pleasure to visit. Once again you are required to present your paid ticket prior to entry. I would think 20-30 minutes would suffice. We had several large groups entering so be",
          "We walked around to see and amazing old house nearly 300 years and still in excellent condition. We,met with the owner while we were there. All the furniture in excellent condition like the ancient time. Amazing.",
          "This ia another old interesting house in the old town, these building all make up the fabric that is the old town, so worth looking at as they are all slightly different",
          "This is a popular tourist site. During our visit, several tourist groups came and went. Every group is presented with a short informative history of the house and interesting relics are pointed out, can be a bit commercial. Can get quite crowded. Beautifully preserved though.",
          "Beautiful merchant house with sophisticated decor, historical objects and a wonderful little inner courtyard. Quite pleasant if crowded...",
          "An old house, very deep going back from the street to the river. Clearly was owned by a wealthy person. Lots of interesting contents to see. There was a group doing a traditional music and dance show for about 30 minutes too inside the front main entrance room",
          "The staff is nice and courteous, but, inclined towards selling Souvenirs instead of giving more information about the history and facts of this house and information related to it.",
          "Another stop on a waling tour of Old Hoi An. It was an interesting view of historic Hoi An. Our tour guide droned on a little too long. Again, ok for a quick walk through. Recommended",
          "Visited with our guide, he was very informative with the history of this very well preserved old house, thats several hundred years old, all the rooms are small in size, and packed with various antiques, the old house reflects the combination of both Japanese and Chinese. The",
          "This is one of the places included when you buy the pass before entering the old town. It is well worth the stop to see the interior decor whit some of the fine, old furniture.",
          "Buy the 150,000d Old Town Pass, it allows you free entrance to 5 historic sites. It's a donation to help resoration efforts.",
          "This was an old Chinese traders house and it is beautifully decorated with mother of pearl inlay. The house is built to withstand the floods that happen in Hue every year and you can see the heights of the floods as recently as last November when the water reached about 7-8 feet",
          "The house was a merchants residence as the town of Hoi An was a commercial port. Even though the town's business has declined and there have been several devasting floods the house has been beautifully maintained by the 7 generations that have occupied it. It contains many of",
          "It was worth visiting. Despite the floates all These years and centuries this house still stand on his place. Great Quality of Wood and handgrafting. Admirable!",
          "Visit only one old house. Ask ur tour guide to take you to only one as the story they tell inside is very repetitive... Location makes for some goods pictures.",
          "This small but very worth while House is a must to visit during a stay in Hoi An. This house is still kept within the family from I believe 7 generations. The artefacts and furniture are kept in superb condition and reflects how villagers would live in days gone by.",
          "This is a very good use of one of the five \"relics\" to spend your Hoi An Ancient Town ticket on. There's a short sales pitch by a tour guide giving a perfunctory explanation of the house, but the advertisement isn't as bad as in other places here. The home is beautiful, and you",
          "Beautiful old Merchants house. Supposed to be the most famous and important in Hoi An. Only four rooms but beautiful. Chinese and Japanese architecture with lovely mosaics in the garden.",
          "Another stop on your Hoi An exploration. Need a ticket to enter. Weel preserved slice of history and ancient architecture.",
          "The building is interesting, and has good signed info in English and Vietnamese. The cross section of the house is good. You can see the flood levels and the mother of pearl carving is lovely. The interior is marred by tourist sales tables and a hard sell to buy zodiac coins.",
          "...then it is probably the best we visited. However these visits result always disappointed and in the end they always try to sell you their souvenirs. Presentation delivered like a robot, without emotion neither passion.",
          "I first visited Hoi An more than 25 years ago, and over the years as tourism has impacted this ancient town, more and more people have sold out to restaurants, souvenir shops, clothing shops, tailors, and bars. The result is that there are now few remaining real residences in",
          "It is amazing how the house survives all the floods. The house is small but worth the trip. You should visit it.",
          "If you have a rainy day to spare in the area, check it out. Nothing too exciting. But interesting to see interior of the old houses. The courtyards are beautiful.",
          "One of the places you can visit when you are on a walking tour of the old town of Hoi An. Was good to see the old house and get to know about the history associated with it. There are 5 places you can choose to visit on the ticket you purchase to enter the old town ; you can",
          "Your tickets are better used in the communal areas. Not much to see inside this home. Skip it unless you\u2019re bored.",
          "The Old House of Tan Ky is an educational and interesting experience - an insight into the history of Hoi An and it's people. Would be good for a visit with children",
          "Went to visit the old house in order to learn about Hoi an and the other Asian influence..instead we received a brief description and our guide mostly wanted us to buy the items they were selling in the old house. Didn\u2019t feel we got much out of the tour and when the guide",
          "This house is still occupied by the 5th generation of the family who built the house. The most interesting thing about the house is the way it was built. Since Hoi An frequently floods the interior walls can be removed and stored upstairs with all the furniture until the flood",
          "Fascinating house built by the family which still lives upstairs and generating of which have photo's displayed in the lounge before the internal courtyard. Flood markers indicate how high flood water can go as recently as November 2017 but with the right hardwood construction",
          "A relatively impressive period building that has been restored at different points in its history like much of Hoi An. The major problem here is simply lack of information about its role and place in local history. Also much of the artwork, photography and sculpture looks pretty",
          "This Vietnamese house was built two centuries ago and combines Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese architectural features. There are only four rooms in the house and are filled with wooden antiques. These were a welcoming room, a living room, courtyard and a bedroom. On one wall,",
          "Very busy, far too many visitors at the same time so you can not really see and enjoy the visit. Positive the free guidance .",
          "Was a stop to use up one of our tickets. Interesting but over run with people. Girl who showed us through was lovely!",
          "We chose this house as one of our stops on our tourist ticket. It is a well preserved old home in Hoi An where seven generations of the family have lived. One interesting thing to note is the flood levels recorded on the wall with the most recent one being just a few short",
          "Short and interesting visit. I didn't love the guide - she showed us around in 3 min and was mad when we didn't want to buy a small gold coin - but other than that, it was great!",
          "We fell upon this amazing house. Such a beautiful place to stop and get a taste for how things were. The woodwork is incredible. Asian French Fusion. Some neat art to buy as well!",
          "Perhaps I had too high expectations from recommendations. It's interesting to see the flood markers but the hard sell on the tangentially associated zodiac coins made it a bit stressful. Worth a quick shifty round though.",
          "The wooden house was built two centuries ago using Chinese and Japanese influences. Beautiful interior decorated with Chinese poems written in inlaid mother-of-pearl. A courtyard provides light, ventilation and collects rainwater. From time to time they suffer flooding of",
          "always a lot of people and I didn't get a tour but enjoyed just admiring the house and imaging what it was like in the old days. A must see",
          "It is advisable to take a guided tour if you visit these old \u201cheritage\u201d houses or you will never appreciate why it is being fussed about. The history is impressive and the fact that despite all the calamities that passed by, it is still standing good. But if you\u2019re not into",
          "One of the many \"old houses\" of Hoi An, this one is one of the oldest and most interesting. Built of wood, the rooms are crowded and dark. In the middle is a tiny central outdoor courtyard to let in light and rainwater. They serve free tea here, which is very refreshing, and",
          "We had a short (unfortunately) guided tour and it was very interesting to learn about the life of the people in ancient Hoi An. Would recommend a guide to get some background.",
          "Lovely little house of a real Vietnamese family, who still live upstairs. Two downstairs rooms with quite a few pieces of antic furniture. The ground floor gets flooded every year due to its proximity to the river, and the signs on the walls show the levels of floods, this",
          "Well worth stopping off and taking a tour of this ancient merchant's house. Interesting to think that members of the same family are still living there. Take a guided tour and you will be given a refreshing drink as well as an insight into the long history of the house and the",
          "Not much to see. As 5 attractions are included in the ticket for the old town we visites this one as well. 5 minutes is enough.",
          "Don`t miss this Old building . A Beautifull example of a Ancient House.Such a clever lift system to get all your ground floor furnishings above the the water line when the river floods .",
          "We visited here as part of the Old Town pass, and it was very interesting to read the story of Tan Ky and to see the manner in which he lived. Marvellous to think that his ancestors are still residing there.",
          "I didn't see the point of stopping there. I've used one of my 5 sightsees in there and regretted it ...",
          "One of the old trading houses of Hoi An. You will need to use one of your tickets from the Old Town Pass which you can purchase from ticket booths around the town. Interesting to see and learn about trading in the area at the time. One of the interesting facts is how the floods",
          "Came as part of an intrepid tour. Really lovely home. Part of old hoi an ticket. Can see why it has become an unesco site.",
          "It is amazing how the house survives all the floods. It is great the city restores these old homes. A tour guide is recommended. Much cheaper directly through the Hoi An Office of Tourist.",
          "Interesting old house that truly represented the life of Hoi On merchant family in old days. But the scale and the level of preservation are not impressive when compare it with the same in Macau or Guangzhou. The later intervention of the heritage house makes it a bit messy.",
          "There is little to see. The 'tour' was about 2 sentences when sat on a couple of plastic stools. At the end of the 2 sentences we thought we were about to go on the tour we were passed on to another lady whose job was purely to sell us some tat. That was it. Don't waste the 10",
          "Very interesting history, how they lived & means of survival in the old days. Amazing artefacts, clothing of that era, how it must have been living in that era & time.",
          "This old house was built from traditional materials and was influenched by Chinese and Japanese styles. Very wellkept with a big wooden doors. You can look at the old antiques and art in the house.",
          "It was interesting to have a look around. There are flood level markings and old furniture. However, the staff working there ruined our experience as they were so rude to us. We had a 'guided tour' which was very rushed and came to an abrupt end when we said we did not want to",
          "We used the tickets from our \"passport\" for the town to visit, we were shown around and had an enjoyable visit.",
          "On arrival you are given a welcome tea and a guide gives a small tour and explanation of the insides. Our guide had really good English and the length of time she spent talking was perfect. Well worth a visit.",
          "Great to go in and have a look around, it is informative and interesting to see what houses were like around the area",
          "The house is small but worth the trip. It is still run by the family, it has amazing inlaid woodwork, and the dark wood furnishing gives it a special appeal. There are other places to visit, but this one does not try to sell anything. We enjoyed touring the house.",
          "It's perfect way to see the culture. Nice architecture and wooden making. Highly recommend everyone to come and visit.",
          "If you get a attraction ticket then this is one of the sites you can visit as part of the ticket. The house gives you an insight into life in Hoi An in a previous age but nothing special",
          "My wife and I stopped at the Old House of Tan Ky while in Hoi An. We particularly loved Hoi An, what a beautiful place, and this house suits it so well. The house itself is wonderfully traditional, even though part of it is still lived in and used. The most fascinating part",
          "The house was packed with tourists and I had to visit it very quickly. There were some explanations from guides, but they were trying to make people do a fast visit.",
          "After presenting our tickets we were told to sit down on a bench just inside the door.A couple of minutes later, we were approached by our 'guide'. Our tour lasted literally less than a minute, and ended rather abruptly when we said we didn't want to buy anything. Our guide",
          "When you arrive here you are greeted by a host whose job seems to be please you enough so that you might buy something. The welcome felt fake and made me want to leave sooner rather than later. The house history and the architecture is beautiful, shame how its operated.",
          "Disappointing. Ushered in with a rushed spiel of history then quickly lead to the souvenirs for sale that have sadly taken over this historic house. Not worth it.",
          "Very vibrant restaurant, good traditional food, service efficient. Great value for money. Nice views over the river.",
          "Tan Ky is a showcase of a typical Vietnamese old house still well-preserved and in existence in the heart of Hoi An Ancient Town. There's a family still living and looking after this old traditional wooden house and there's even a flood indicator showing how bad the flood",
          "Went to this as part of a tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff explain key features and you can gave tea. People still live here - and put up with an annual flood up to a metre - how the 200+ year old wood survives is amazing. The calligraphy in mother if pearl is",
          "Came to learn how Vietnamese people make their house, very nice decoration with great caving. The house was very cool because of Yin & Yang tile and timber. Surprised that house was still in good condition even in the flood very often. Thank you!",
          "I stopped by the old house to discover that a family actually lives there. They will let you walk through it for a dollar",
          "Whilst it is amazing that a family still live in this house albeit that masses or tourists walk through every day I simply found that the house was hard to enjoy as a result of how crowded it was with tourists. I felt as if I was on a conveyer belt. In between people taking",
          "We wondered in to th old house with our ticket for the old town attractions and expected to wander through and hav a look, but a member of the family in the old house grabbed the 2 of us and sat us down and explained the house before showing us around, and yes we bought a",
          "A guide will shuffle you through this old house with a few sentences of interpretation and then sell you souvenirs. Walk through and check out the old furniture and architecture, and continue on.",

          "Visiting the Old House of Tan Ky is limited to the first floor (as it's still a private residence), a tea, and a short narrative. For me the most interesting part of the visit is to see the lines on the walls marking the levels of the record-high floodwaters. The house guides",

          "This house was quite interesting from the perspective of how much family pride they have in the house and its heritage. The house is still occupied and run by family after 7 generations. Just look at the pics on the walls. Fascinating to see how they handle flooding too --",
          "I visited Tan Ky House as part of an evening walking tour of the Hoi An Old Town with a group of 30 people. This place is way too small for 30 people. We couldn't all fit into the main area of the house, let alone do any exploring before the next group came in. This isn't a mark",

          "This Tan Ky old house does not allow you to go upstairs as it's still occupied by the family. They also seem more interested in selling you chinese coins as lucky charms. Really takes away the real reason why a tourist would want to visit such an ancient place. Disappointing.",
          "The house encompasses elements of Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese, which made it rather interesting. The 5-10 min quick introduction about the house was useful and insightful. After the introduction, we were left to wonder around the small house mostly on our own. Yes, they",

          "Yes, the house is \"on the tourist trail\", but it just seems commercialised and not really representative of how people would have lived in the oldie houses. There is a good sign on the wall with markings of high floods from earlier years and a little yard/garden to explore.",

          "A charming and quaint old house, dating from the 18th century. Beautiful wood carvings and mother of pearl inscriptions. Listening to a short informative talk whilst seated on period furniture was a plus, as was the welcome cup of tea. Not much hard sell going on inside,",
          "The family still live upstairs so you can only view the downstairs which is part taken up by a kitchen and part by a table of trinkets they want to sell you. Having done the tour of the Blue Mansion in Malaysia and the beautiful old shophouses in Melaka was a let down.",

          "This is the prototypical family house from old time Hoi An. One gets a good explanation of architectural details, views on the family that lived there along with cultural details, etc. all this and a small cup of tea. I felt they pushed the souvenir aspects a bit much, my guess",
          "There wasn't much to the house of Tan Ky -- a thimble full of tea, a quick rundown on the family members, and an opportunity to buy souvenirs. The specialty of the house is horoscope medallions for $1.00 US.",
          "Unless you dive into the architecture details inch by inch or meditate in front of the Chinese poems, 5-10 minutes is more than enough in this house overcrowded by tourists from time to time. Having said that, the exterior (facing the riverfront) is amazing, especially when the",
          "This is probably the house to visit if you visit only one of the old houses. Fascinating to see how the merchants along the river front used to live, although try to go off-peak as it's not large and can get crowded.",
          "Compact but absolutely charming. Beautiful design and decoration from the building itself with internal courtyard, to the furnishings. Preserved and presented with love and care. Seven generations of a successful trading family have lived here. House is in the middle of town",
          "Really interesting home to bust where the family still live. Typical Vietnamese house built around a small courtyard. Good guide who pointed out main features. Well worth a visit.",
          "In addition to being a multi-generational house, it's another opportunity to purchase more handicrafts...hand embroidered tablecloths/napkins.",
          "It is fantastic that so many of the historical buildings have been preserved - very difficult to choose which to visit. This was written up as being one of the best and it is very beautiful and interesting to see, but it only takes 5 minute to visit which we did right at the",
          "I enjoyed this unique visit; the ticket lady noticed we were English so gladly took us around the two rooms and explained different areas to us. The house has some great architecture and a tiny shop at the exit. It is a short visit, we spent about less than half an hour here.",
          "Beautiful Hoi An style house showing a combination of Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese architecture. Look out for the flood level markers here.",
          "The old house is included in the Hoi An pass. It contains a mixed heritage and provides an interesting insight into home life from a couple of centuries ago. Quite cramped inside so choose a less busy time to visit. A qualified useful.",
          "I enjoyed visiting this ancient house. It was one of the places you could go into on the ticket you purchase for Hoi An Ancient Town. The house itself was small and there were quite a few people in there when I visited. The old furniture is interesting to look at. There was",
          "one of the oldest and most well kept buildings in hoi an, this is a mix of vietnamese, chinese and japanese styles of architecture. quite small and can be navigated in about 15 mins.there is an entrance fees for it and it is right in the center of the town",
          "I found the \"old house of tan my\" very interesting. You could definitely feel the history in the house. Our guide explained it's history . A mixture of both Chinese and Japanese imprints. I felt very privileged to see it. Tip : make sure you have a tour guide, early morning",
          "This is the most interesting ancient house of the lot, and it was ornately decorated, with lots of interesting details to look out for. There were people still living in the house, which adds yet another interesting detail to it.",
          "This is one of the oldest house in Hoi An ancient town. I really like this because it gives me a quick view about culture, architecture and people's lives here.",
          "As a part of our walking tour through the streets of Hoi An, we visited this interesting house almost at closing time, but it was worth it. I didn't take more than 10 minutes to see everything. The highlights were the wooden mother-of-pearl furniture and the flood levels marked",
          "This was a lovely house. Stopped by in the morning and was served some tea and given a quick explanation into the history of the house and the architectural design, which has Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese influences. They do sell a few little trinkets that symbolize luck,",
          "One of the oldest houses in Hoi An. It tends to fill up with tourists. A short talk from a guide is included. Most notable are the flood level markers at the back of the house!",
          "Great history and well spoken guides at the home. Beautiful combination of Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese architecture.",
          "We visited this charming 200 year old ancestral home as part of our tour of Hoian. This house was built by a wealthy Vietnamese merchant and has been owned by the same family for seven generations. It is such a beautiful structure that utilizes both Chinese and Japanese",
          "We visited waiting to see a shop, not a house (due to the reviews here) but eventually it was pretty nice. A bit small.",
          "Part of ancient hoian pass visit.. ( 5 thingys on one pass) and this could be included within that . I found most old homes and assembly halls rather similar with Japanese ,Chinese and Vietnamese influences in their structures ..however this for me struck the best compared to",
          "Well worth the visit as part of our 5 building pass. Really interesting to see these lovely old original houses and learn a bit of their history.",
          "This old house were made of precious wood which made it look very nice. There's still a family living there to take good care of the house from generation to generation. Worth to have a visit!",
          "This old house is very nicely preserved and is itself worth seeing. As you get the tour, you get the \"opportunity\" to buy stuff, from US$1 \"lucky\" charms based on your year of birth, to artwork to an entire souvenir shop of things at the side of the house near the water. They",
          "It is probably best to read up about this first as it is quite a small place and you don't get a lot of time to hang around. The pillars going into the courtyard have Chinese characters on them which are made up of carved birds in different positions of flight and are about 150",
          "From the houses we visited, this one was the best. They provided us with information about the history of the house. Although they tried to sell us some souvenirs, they weren't annoying. Don't miss this sightseeing place if you visit the city.",
          "I was mesmerised by the interior of this place when I stepped into this beautiful, well preserved 18th century merchant's house that is still owned and occupied by the 7th generation. Despite the flood that ravage this charming old town of Hoi An where Tan Ky is located, much",
          "We visited this attraction as one of five using the Hoi An Attraction Pass. We were ushered in the door and told about the history of the place and then asked our year of birth and told the animal that related to the year. We were told we would have good luck if we purchased",
          "We visited Tan Ky as part of our \"5 sites visits\" and were looking forward to having a look around this family home. To our big disappointment the place was packed with tourists and we could only see a small part of the house. We were rushed through some historical facts of the",
          "Tan Ky Old house is an almost perfect example of a 18th merchant\u2019s residence in this major commercial port town. Seven generations of the family have continuously strived to keep the house in good condition. Therefore though it\u2019s not the oldest, Tan Ky is the most",
          "For the architectural enthusiast. Other than that, the house is filled with tourist trinkets but no pressure to buy. Not one of the better places to visit in Hoi An.",
          "Would have rather been allowed to wander the old home, but instead you are seated to join your language guide for a brief explanation of the site, followed mostly by a guided tour of things you can buy there. It is part of the visit five sites for 120,000 dong or about a $1 a",
          "Ancient old with family still live in there. Well maintained with many paintings on the walls. Few minutes is enough to visit",
          "There was a bit of oversell of their products but this stop is well worth the time spent. We enjoyed learning a little more about Hoi An and its history.",
          "I had hoped we would get a real flavour of an old house here. We went in, were given a cup of tea and a rather pressured 'sell' of some good luck charms! Then we were left to ourselves to go through to a small, rather grubby inner courtyard and another small room [selling",
          "Lovely old house in Hoi An Old Town. Still lived in by the family. Well worth a visit. You can use your tickets here.",
          "Using the multi pass ticket to explore Hoi An is such an easy way to stretch your visit out. This building is a lovely example and the pass is a guilt free way to visit examples like this. Worthwhile stop!",
          "Beautiful old family home in the centre of Hoi An. Still has traditional cooking and sleeping arrangements. One of the family members is usually there but the staff that show you through are very knowledgable. Beautiful antiques and paintings.",
          "This is a very important building in Hoi An as it tells the history of the merchant culture of the area. It's very old and has been carefully preserved. It has beautiful furniture inside so that you get a idea of how people used to live.",
          "I'd read about Tan Ky house in my travel app. There are several of these houses in Hoi An. Basically, these are homes that go back 7,8 or 9 generations with pretty much little or no change since the first generation lived there. Each house still has to this day, the current",
          "Should visit before it gone. The beauty of the old house now transferring into shop house but you still can find \"some\" conners where the color, the smells, the look is staying the same as old day.",
          "Well worth the visit! Take the time to explore not only the ground floor, but also the second floor. Family members are there to answer your questions and to sell you crafts.",
          "Worth the trip in, entry fee included in your entry ticket to old town Hoi An. Contains the only Cup of Confucius in the whole of Vietnam, according to the guide. The family still live upstairs.",
          "house on the banks of the river. Lots to see, tea served as part of the tour. good to see the way of life in Vietnam in olden days. Unesco world heritage site.",
          "Despite contradicting views among visitors, I would advise to use one ticket for this very old house of Tan Ky if you are interested in the history in Hoi An. There are always guides in the old house who would explain everything there is in the house, if you show interesting in",
          "What a lovely old house that shows the ancient architecture of Hoi An. Tan Ky family house gives us a glimpse of their life in that old days! The house could be old and a bit run down, but it is still worth a visit if you are into architecture and history.",
          "Our group stopped by the Old House as part of a tour. We were invited inside where we were seated and given some history of the Old building and offered some tea by the owners as we relaxed and listened to some history of the place. At the end of the tour, the staff was",
          "We read some reviews for this place and thought it sounded interesting but it just wasn't. It's a pretty old house but there are only two rooms and dark ones at that. I've heard that there is meant to be a guide explaining the history to you but for us there just wasn't and with",
          "Compared to Phoung Hung Old House near the Japanese Covered Bridge the Old House of Tan Ky does not have much to offer.",
          "The house inside has some history on it, but you sort of feel like you're actually stepping into someone's home. The grandparents are very kind and gentle when you go in. And are happy to share the history of the building as well, although their english is not so much. But I",
          "Interesting visit to see the interior of the house though the visit only took about 10 mins. Short explanation provided by one of the many guides.",
          "This old house is an interesting visit and worth a few minutes of your time. I feel it needs to be seen as a part of appreciating the overall historical tapestry of Hoi An rather than being a must-see in its own right. I found it a bit dark and dingy. The information about",
          "An interesting part of the historic back story of Hoi An, with lots of good detail. The reason why I haven't scored it higher was simply that it was packed with tours when we arrived and was therefore incredibly hot and felt somewhat artifical. I'm sure if you visit early in the",
          "Use one of the 5 tickets from your Hoi An Ancient Town card to visit this beautiful house. Walk in, be seated, and someone will give you a cup of tea before explaining the history of the house. Next comes the tour. Enjoy!",
          "This house was the first residence to be certified as part of Heritage Village. It is a museum but also a living home. A member of the family will show you around their dwelling. Have a look on the wall where the water level are marked with the dates.of the year monsoon floods.",
          "We used one of our 5 ancient town tickets because we wanted to see one of the old houses and were told that this one was worth a look. We were greeted by a lady who sat our family of 4 down and gave us complimentary iced tea before telling us a little about the house. We then",
          "So, so interesting, family explained they are the 7th generation living there, had family photos on show, very generous with information!!! Didn't feel any pressure to buy souvenirs, glad we didn't miss this house with the 5 ticket pass for Old Hoi An!!!",
          "It is the nicest old house in Hoi An. The owner family members are kind to introduce their house to tourist. You have to buy a ticket to see it and your ticket allows you to see 4 more spots for foreign tourists in Hoi An and 2 more spots for Vietnamese tourists. You will learn",
          "This is one of the old houses that backs onto the river. Enter from the street a block back from the river. You can get in from the street on the river but the door is not obvious on this side (no big sign). They will give you a brief tour of the ground floor only as",
          "When we first went into Hoi An we bought a five ticket pass for 120,000 dong and chose to visit the Japanese bridge, the house of Tan Ky, house of Phung Hung and two assembly halls. All were interesting in different ways. The House of Tan Ky shouts antiquity at you. Everywhere",
          "Lovely old house explaining the Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese influences. You get a cup of tea and there are some nice and inexpensive souvenirs to buy. Look at how it floods too and the trap door for raising the furniture to the top floor.",
          "If you visit Hoi An besides Japanese Brige( Symbol of Hoi an) ,Phuc Kien Assembly hall...You should visit Tan Ky Old House...made of jackfruit wood ,more than 2 years old .You have chance to see magic bowl ( fucian theory),and two old panels...",
          "The house was old. It had construction details of the chinese, japanese and french periode. Quiet atmosphere.",
          "Saw a photo of the founder, Tan Ky. Impressed with the architecture. Learn from the old photos that the house is subjected to flooding during the rainy season in October and November as the house is just a mere 5 m from the river. As in all the ancient sightseeing sites, there",
          "I loved seeing inside this beautiful old house, but the tour was quite bizarre. A guide who spoke English with a very strong accent and too fast ( so very hard to understand), told us a linited amount of information at break neck speed, and then appeared more interested in",
          "To much people, no one could here anything of what the guide said. Worst of all is that it ended with trying to sell us some Signs of what year we are born in (i this relevant for the house?)",
          "Don't normally bother too much with history etc. but was very hot day and thought we would take a few minutes respite from the sun.Was very surprised how interesting it was with its ornate paneling and other artefacts on show.The most interesting thing however was to talk to the",
          "Lovely old house but takes around five minutes to look around. Don't bank on being told anything useful or given any pamphlets. Take your own guidebook for what little you need to know. Possibly the most interesting thing is the flood heights...",
          "If you have been to such similar houses in Penang or Melaka, you will be shaking your head after touring this. My understanding is that this is supposedly the best of Hoi An's old houses for the ticket system but I finished seeing this in five minutes. In any case, the highlight",
          "Six generations have owned this family house. It provides an insight into an 18th century merchants home and is in a remarkable state of preservation. If you have a guide, you will spend about 30 minutes in the house but an appreciably shorter time if visiting by yourself.",
          "No doubt about the history of this house, but there are houses older than this one. For foreigners this may be an attraction, but this house is just an ancient house built. No need for the excitement. You see one you see them all except for the history and what happned there",
          "Really interesting to see inside this old home that time hasn't changed. Wonderfully built to with stand flooding from the river which happens most years.",
          "Nothing special! Easily skippable as far as the various local sites go! There are many other larger and more elaborate spots to see in Hoi An, but if you're walking by you may want to stop in. It only costs 1 ticket of the book of 5 you need to purchase to see the various sites",
          "Interesting visit, but very rushed and busy. It is a \u201cworking\u201d house and still used by the family. That said, it makes it difficult to be a tourist attraction AND a lived-in house. There is no explanation of what you see (luckily we had taken a guide book, so we could understand",
          "The interior furniture was really beautiful but the place was small with not much to see and didn't offer anything new to the other places we had seen. Lovely enough building but don't worry if you miss it out.",
          "The Old House of Tan Ky is a wonderful opportunity to look through a traditional merchant's house from the early 18th century. A member of the original family (this house has held at least six generations) meets you at the entrance and runs through a brief history of the house,",
          "What you get is a look of the main hall of this old house with the grumpy old owner giving you a 10 second run down of how old the house is since he is from the 6th generation living there and that the rafters are Japanese style. In less than 5 minutes you are done! I tried to",
          "Probably pretty cool if your in to your architecture, but there didn't seem to be much there, a little bit of info, it was just nice to be out of the sun for a bit!",
          "This house has been owned by the same family for the past 6 generations. The house is in decent shape, the entry hall woodwork is worth noting. We were happy and thankful to see that the family allows the visitors inside their home. If you have a guide, you will spend about",
          "Not worthy of visiting once you have seen the other similar old houses. Access to upstairs is not allowed. Its English guide seems tired of its repeating introduction, not friendly, got annoyed with me and walk off when she could not answer my simple question on why is this",
          "Great Old House in the center of old town, Hoian - there are a lot of things for you to see and listen from the host of this house. It is worth for you to visit it once to know more the history and tradition of the family and the Hoian town.",
          "Extremely informative and interesting in regard to this Chinese family's history and legacy in this town. Well worth the visit.",
          "Not much to see. Ok if you can understand the person showing you around. Then they try to sell you something before you leave.",
          "Here you don't get a family member that tells the story, but they give you an information board with a story on it. Not very welcoming.",
          "The house itself is interesting and worth a look through (takes about 10 minutes)...We went to visit while a tour bus was there, and the house was so full you couldn't really appreciate of enjoy it, it is beautiful, old architecture though...",
          "We had visited at the noon time. Only the living room out side we can visit. The other rooms is locked and we could not see more. The guide was sitting in the gate and just withdraw our ticket and sleep. We could not enjoy the visit without understanding anything further than",
          "I was astonished to see that this old home is still standing, and allowing hordes of visitors to traipse through! The back of it opens onto the riverfront road, and because of it's proximity to the river it has been severely flooded on numerous occasions. The high-tide mark is",
          "Interesting history of Hoi An floods. Lovely mother of pearl inlay furniture. Generations of family still live here.",
          "Old House of Tan Ky is good for visit as it keep good & original style & feeling also mixed with different style e.g. Vietnamese, Chinese & Japanese style in one place.",
          "One of the things I liked best about this charming 18th century merchant's house is the way the locals hold it in revere. This house is part of the town's historic fabric, its tradition, its heritage. thanks.",
          "not much to keep young kids amused for long here. We did visit on a wet day, so I guess everyone may have been trying to get out of the rain. It does appear to be a well kept place. We got a pamphlet to read for info about the place. Everyone else seemed to speak french and were",
          "I read the reviews and I look at our pictures but I can not really remember very much of our visit to this house. Probably we should not visit all the old houses in one day. This was number five....But more likely it is that we were not impressed by the looks of Tan Ky.",
          "Due to regular flooding (see the levels marked on the woodwork), much of the expensive furniture had been taken upstairs so perhaps a little sparsely furnished. The rooms go back one after the other to the kitchen at the back. Since the family still live there, you can't go",
          "Our guide was able to explain the significance of the house and the items contained in it. Look for the ornate mother of pearl inlay on the walls and furniture. Terrible to think that it gets flooded every few years. Very dark inside but fascinating none the less.",
          "The House is a very interesting, a small old house which has been occupied by the same family for several generations and has a wonderful collection of Chinese furniture. The souvenir section detracted a little. But the history is interesting",
          "We feel that this is a very important building in Hoi An as it tells the history of the merchant culture of the area. This is one of the buildings we found told us much about the Vietnamese history of the area.",
          "A laten evening visit made even better by us being the only group there (18 of us). Evocative of a long gone era made even better by our tour being led by the 94 year old head of the household.",
          "One of the things I liked best about this charming 18th century merchant's house is the way the locals hold it in revere. This house is part of the town's historic fabric, its tradition, its heritage - and, as such, it has been lovingly restored and cared for. The house is",
          "I found the water lines and how they prepare for the flooding to be very interesting. It was nice to see how the wealthy live and lived many years ago. Don't be turned off by the vendors once inside. They put no pressure on you to buy.",
          "It is very old and has been carefully preserved. It has beautiful furniture inside, so that you get a idea of how people used to live. It is cared for immaculately.",
          "It's a small place, but it gives an idea of how people lived long time ago. One or two of the ancient houses in Hoi An are definitely worthy of visiting",
          "Tan Ky is worth a quick 5-10 minute visit. Yes it was interesting to see the blend of architectural styles and the markings on the walls of past floodwater levels, and the stories of the many generations who have lived and still live there and I did love the old hardwoods used",
          "A free cup of tea from the welcome lady starts a quick look around this old house. Get you lucky Ying-Yang charm to hang up in your home for a couple of quid; don't miss the panel with the flood level markings from previous years.",
          "Seven generations have lived or are living here - despite it flooding virtually every year! Very traditional - look for the inlaid mother of pearl in the shape of birds, making Chinese characters, on the columns.",
          "The tour of the house, yard and shop lasted about 10mins. It paid homage to a rich guy whose house still stands despite perennial flooding. The souvenirs are passable. Still, an eye-opener for those who want to know how it looks like to be rich in the past.",
          "The most interesting part of the visit is to see where the flood waters have raised to. The talk given is very rushed with the main aim for you to buy a souvenir based upon your horoscope. Very dark inside. I wouldn't rush to visit.",
          "This is one of the better restored old houses in the town. It can get a little overrun with tourists which along with the abundance of souvenirs can tend to distract from the overall experience. My advice would be to to visit early in the morning before the crowds gather.",
          "This place is ruined by perfunctory guides who are just poor sales people. I hate to recommend giving the place a pass but what would have been probably a fascinating house is ruined by the souvenir stands, gift shop and bad guides dominating the home",
          "You must go in and visit this house. Beautiful with all the old teak. It give good insight to the culture of Vietnam mixing business with home life from the same house. Handed down in generation to the youngest son. Very interesting to see how male & female live separately. The",
          "Nice to have a local tell you some of the history, shame there is always a push on the things to buy",
          "Hoi An is full of history but the old houses are an amazing insight into life and business in old times. You can see where the modern Vietnamese shops get their balance of living and business intermixed.",
          "Tan Ky house is in the old quarter of the city. It\u2019s one of the interesting places to visit for the insight it offers in the history of the city as a major trading town. Well preserved, it is as it was two centuries ago, the residence of a well to do Vietnamese merchant. The",
          "The house is a complex of Chinese and Japanese architerture, evidence of the long and complicated history of HoiAn and Tan Ky family. traditional decoration as well as flodd photos of the house and wall marks of flood water level plus the family members telling visitors about",
          "Someone will explain some of the history and features of the house on entering which really helps with appreciating the house as you only see parts of the ground floor. One of the better old houses to visit and use your ticket on. There is also a small shop in the house where",
          "I was expecting to give up a ticket and wander around, but thats, sadly, not the plan here. The \"giude\" tells you a little about the place, but to be honest if you read your guidebook you;ll find out more. Once the tour is over (which only takes 5 minutes) the guide will try",
          "Beautiful Building in Old town . Perhaps the best one around . Very nice mother of pearl furniture inside. Seen it and get out",
          "Sadly a lot of the old houses try to sell you something when you visit, having already paid the 120KVD to get access tickets for up to 5 locations in town, we thought this was a bit of a cheek! However, we learned a lot about the different houses, and this was one of the better",
          "... as they employ a guide, visiting here first will help you to understand all of the other buildings in Hoi An. It is a very ornate house and laid out traditionally with bedroom, temple, courtyard to let in the light, kitchen, sitting area etc. The furniture is all inlaid with",
          "Best visited either early or late, this well preserved old house is a pleasant place for a relaxing linger. However, if you do so, you'll also notice the inconsistent treatment of visitors, how small it is and that they will serve food but only if you ask. To be fair, the",
          "The house had been in th family for 7 generations (I think!), the tradition of family respect and homage to ancestors is well represented. The structure of Vietnamese houses is follwowed, we particularly liked to internal open atrium with a balcony on three sides on the first",
          "We enjoyed the private tour we arranged in Hoi An, including House of Tan Ky. It is beautiful, and historic, but not especially so in either category. I found the marks of recent floods to be eye opening and insightful as to living conditions in modern day Hoi An.",
          "The house is beautiful indeed,it is worse a look,however there is only one room and a small patio to see,I thought there is much more into it as being so famous.",
          "This ancient family home provided a glimpse into life during the the hey days of Hoi An. An informative printed history painted a picture of some of the activities of everyday life of a busy merchant.",
          "On the one hand, it's a lovely place to look at and the guides are a nice touch. On the other, it's small, crowded and as some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this place is half-attraction, half-souvenir shop. Seeing as you need to sacrifice one of your Old Town",
          "Don't waste your time. It is a souvenir shop you have to pay for to get into. It's nothing special at all. Take a boat on the river instead.",
          "Well preserved considering it gets flooded almost every year. Still belongs to a private family. Gives good sense of how a tube house is laid out.",

Their products are very skillful and sophisticated, even though they are farmers and do not specialize in handicrafts. The techniques were kept secret, but taught to relatives or fellow villagers.\nThe village, therefore, became a very important institution in the handicraft industry. The village's name became the trademark of handicraft products made by its villagers. \u0110\u00ecnh l\u00e0ng- the village's temple became the place of worship and t\u1ed5 ngh\u1ec1 the man who first taught the villagers to do these handicraft works.\nWhen urbanization came to Vietnam, many people came to towns/cities and professionalized in the handicraft works they had done in their old village. They did not compete with one another but gathered in ph\u01b0\u1eddng/h\u1ed9i, the new form of handicraft village, to help others to improve.\nThe Vietnamese government has recognised about 1500 handicraft villages, of which about 300 are traditional handicraft villages.

          "Spent about 4 hours atTraQue Vegetable Village. The people were helpful and friendly and showed us around their organic markets garden. We helped them dig a small patch and plant some seedlings. Then an added bonus, we were given a cooking class and cooked a Vietnamese Pancake.",
          "Was ok, just patches of vegetable patches and some cooking classes going on. We had a bike your and stopped here for lunch. Was nothing spectacular but good if you just want to understand the local agriculture",

          "Just half a kilometre up the road f-rom the Tomb of Tani Yajirobei is the Tra Que Vegetable Farm, a community of people who grow a wide variety of veggies and herbs in the rich soil at the top of the rice field. And rarely have any rural areas in Vietnam whe-re livelihood is",
          "This is a good way to get an understanding of food production in Vietnam. The food is grown for the community not for individual families. This is a very fertile area and the vegetables are bedded in seaweed harvested nearby. The people working the fields are normally happy to",
          "Excellent way to spend a morning - beautiful beds of vegetables that are so well tended that Martha Stewart would be envious.",
          "We took bikes from the hotel and went around Tra Que. This is an amazing collection of plants - both common and exotic to our European eyes. Restaurants close at hand, such as Baby Mustard, use the crops directly in their menus.",
          "If you visit Hoi An make the time to visit this area as you will see the real Vietnam. The gardens are very interesting as the tendency to keep vegetables and herbs watered, fertilized and weeded are spectacular to watch. True dedication and patience is exhibited here. The",
          "Just out of Hoi An itself, the vegetable village is a tranquil, peaceful place to relax for an hour or two. Beautiful rows of vegetables and flowers ( grown mainly for their seeds) tended by local villagers along the lines of allotments. After a lovely walk around, we sat down",
          "There has been a vegetable garden on this site for 500 hundred years and it is still totally organic. They use seaweed to fertilise. It is beautifully tended in the neatest rows I've ever seen. Puts English kitchen gardens to shame! We met one of the ladies that lives and works",
          "not far from the old town. you can bike there easily. someone will come and sell you the entrance ticket, which is about 1usd, if not mistaken. small but nice enough for an hours walk. they provide cooking class too",
          "Our group had a very nice bike ride that took about an hour out to the village. We rode along the canals and back country and saw a lot of the locals who were smiling and more than excited to see foreigners passing through their villages. Once we arrived to the vegetable",
          "This was a side trip on one of our tours. Talk about fresh! Everything grown is local. They supply the town with the produce. We enjoyed a delicious lunch here. We even made our our crepes through the constant and watchful eye of the chef. Lunch was huge. Way more food than",
          "Enjoyed a great day gardening and getting to know the family. We learnt to cook some interesting dishes and ate til we could eat no more. Because they are (I am told) only involved with Buffalo tours they aren't trying to sell you anything and we really got a great idea of how",

          "Visit this place if you want to experience a restaurant in a vegetable garden setting. They run a cooking class. Food in the restaurant is very good. But do call in advance to check if they are busy. We had to wait nearly an hour for our food. Nice and relaxing place but only",
          "We hired bikes and rode their from Hoi An. We saw some people on tours, learning how to grow the veggies, but we were happy to do our own thing. From there, it is not too far to the beach, where we sat and ate the biggest coconuts I've ever seen!",
          "As the local guide of an overcharged tour group said, why pay to see vegetables. if you cycle round this delightful village you get the picture. We encountered a group of French tourists dressed in local costumes and hats, compulsory it seemed as part of their tour. Easy to get",
          "We had the pleasure to see close hand the vegetable gardens. We were shown the soil preparation through planting process...all organic...interesting and fun. This was followed by a cooking lesson and a wonderful meal.",
          "This was part of an optional excursion with a Gate 1 tour and, in my opinion, the worst excursion of the trip. The food was fresh tasting, but otherwise there was little of interest here for me. I wish I had spent my time in old Hoi An.",
          "Cycled out here from hoi an. It's not far. The locals all say hello and are very friendly . Try cycling down some of the more secluded lanes, herb village is amazing and immaculately kept. Stop at baby mustard for a drink or meal. (See review for baby mustard) definitely worth",
          "We enjoyed the farmer tour in Tra Que Village and that was really excited. We were real farmers as we wished. The tour guide was good in English. He expained to us everything. Happy tour, happy time in Hoi An.",
          "This tour is very interesting to understand the importance of the culinary herbs, used every day in traditional Vietnamese cuisine. You can go there by bicycle and you will be well welcome by local people. It should be better if you ask for a guide because it is not sure that",
          "As a herb grower, I have developed an affinity for Tra Que. I have found the staff to be refreshingly friendly and have even picked up a few tips on growing and using herbs",
          "The village is approx 300 years old and seeing the woman working the fields with their conical hats is like seeing a stereotypical Vietnamese countryside photo. Everyone seems very friendly, the smells from the fresh herbs growing round the fields are nice - it's just a nice",
          "This is a communal vegetable garden about 6 km outside Hoi An. There are at least 6 restaurants in the area that offer cooking classes but most cater to tourist-agency organized groups and not private experiences. An exception is Baby Mustard. The area is quite beautiful; the",

          "The chef at this restaurant was hilarious. He taught us how to make sizzling pancakes and all were welcome to try to make their own. The Farm was beautifully laid out and well cared for. The food was plentiful and delicious",

          "Our guide met us at 8.30am and we headed to the old city of Hoi An. We visited 5 different museums and also saw the silkworm in action. We then cycled to the vegetable farm, through the vey ordered rows of spring onions,mint, basil etc.to start with we carved our own vegetable",

          "It was fine and if it's part of your cooking school tour then worth the visit. It can be smelly especially in the seafood section",
          "Tra Que is a must see you can easily visit by bike on your way to AnBang beach, my favourite place to chill out. Early morning is the best time to watch and photo the people and the amazing range of herbs and vegetables being grown.",

          "Great travel experiences when we visited Tra Que vegetable village. We, Cosmos Travel Vietnam Co., Ltd, recommend that travelers should do a farmer tour in this village. You live the life and daily works of local villagers: water vegetables, pick up negative herbs, great care",
          "We went with our two girls (8 and 11) visited the farm, travelled by bikes to the local market and then cooked 4 dishes (which we then ate for lunch) super tops I would recommend the cooking rather than the farming trip",
          "I loved this little escape. It really gave a traveller a sense of what it was like to be a farmer. The foot bath at the end was a bit of heaven and the cooking lesson was delightful. I absolutely love the lemon basil tea.",

          "This was a good place to see some different farming techniques, but it was a little hard to find. We saw some tourists that were dressed as farmers and seemed to be going to work with the people on the farm. That might have made the experience more interesting.",
          "This was a brillient experience. For anyone looking for a cooking class which is tailored to your taste and done with tradition look no further. We booked in for the morning class and was able to look around the gardens before using the ingredients in our own meal. Sadly the",

        "wiki": "The Hoa people (Hua \u83ef in Mandarin Chinese) are an ethnic minority group in Vietnam or existing overseas of Han Chinese descent. Their history has many parallels with the Chinese Indonesians, aka, the Orang Tionghoa.\nThey also belong to the Overseas Chinese diaspora group. They may also be called \"Vietnamese-Chinese\", \"Chinese-Vietnamese\" or \"Chinese people living in/from Vietnam\" by the Vietnamese and Chinese diaspora and by the Overseas Vietnamese. Although Ancient China brought over many cultural, religious and philosophical thought to Vietnam, the Hoa people during the French occupation were known for siding with Mainland Chinese forces and French forces in heavily exploiting Vietnamese resources. Despite this, the Hoa community still exists in contemporary Vietnamese society today, either as descendants of Han Chinese who have immigrated to Vietnam over the nation's long and complex history, or as more recent immigrants. During the time that Vietnam was under Chinese domination, there was an attempt to assimilate the Vietnamese. The reverse happened where the Chinese Vietnamized and rebelled against Chinese Imperial rulers.In contemporary times, Hoa people have assimilated with the Vietnamese population. The Hoa people started many businesses in Ho Chi Minh City pre-1975. Many Hoa people had their businesses and property confiscated by the Communist Party after 1975, and had fled the country as South Vietnamese people faced persecution by the Communist Government. Hoa persecution intensified in late 1970 during the Sino-Vietnamese War. Post-1988, the Vietnamese government's shift to economic liberalization revived the remaining Hoa's economic presence in Vietnamese society. In recent times, the ethnic Hoa people have assimilated into contemporary Vietnamese society, due to similar traditions and religious beliefs. The current Hoa population is officially acknowledged to be around 800,000 people. However, the numbers have steadily decreased over time.\n\n\n== Migration history ==\n\n\n=== 2nd century BC; 14th century AD: Early history ===\n\nAccording to the old Vietnamese historical records \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0 and Kh\u00e2m \u0111\u1ecbnh Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed Th\u00f4ng gi\u00e1m c\u01b0\u01a1ng m\u1ee5c (\"\u6b3d\u5b9a\u8d8a\u53f2\u901a\u9451\u7db1\u76ee\"), An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n) was a prince of the Chinese state of Shu (\u8700, which shares the same Chinese character as his surname Th\u1ee5c), sent by his father first to explore what are now the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Yunnan and second to move their people to modern-day northern Vietnam during the invasion of the Qin Dynasty.\nSome modern Vietnamese believe that Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n came upon the \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t territory (modern-day northernmost Vietnam, western Guangdong, and southern Guangxi province, with its capital in what is today Cao B\u1eb1ng Province). After assembling an army, he defeated King H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng XVIII, the last ruler of the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng Dynasty, around 257 BC. He proclaimed himself An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng (\"King An D\u01b0\u01a1ng\"). He then renamed his newly acquired state from V\u0103n Lang to \u00c2u L\u1ea1c and established the new capital at Phong Kh\u00ea in the present-day Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd town in northern Vietnam, where he tried to build C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel, the spiral fortress approximately ten miles north of that new capital.\nHan Chinese migration into Vietnam dates back to the 2nd Century BC when the Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang first placed Tonkin under Qin rule, an influx of Qin Chinese soldiers and fugitives from Central China settled en masse into Tonkin from this time onwards, and introduced Chinese influences to the ancient Viet people. The Chinese military leader Zhao Tuo founded the Trieu dynasty which ruled Nanyue in southern China and northern Vietnam. The Qin Governor of Canton advised Zhao to found his own independent Kingdom since the area was remote and there were many Chinese settlers in the area. A century later, the powerful Han dynasty conquered and annexed Nanyue (which in Chinese translates to \"Southern Yue\") into the Han Empire and was ruled as a province of China for the next several hundred years. Han imperial control proceeded to expand further southwestward by military means after the conquest.Sinification of Nanyue was brought about by a combination of Han imperial military power, regular settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees, merchants, scholars, bureaucrats, fugitives, and prisoners of war. The conquest also made it possible to extend the Han Empire's power projection and maritime influence to further develop trade relations with the various kingdoms in Southeast Asia. The Chinese prefect of Jiaozhi Shi Xie ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese Emperors. Shi Xie was the leader of the elite ruling class of Han Chinese families who immigrated to Vietnam and played a major role in infusing Vietnam's culture with Chinese influences. Many Chinese fled to the Vietnamese part of the Red River Valley from Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces during the tumult which occurred during the transition from the Western to Eastern Jin Dynasty, when northern China was plunged into anarchy.The Chinese rulers encouraged the immigration of Han Chinese into Tonkin, and implemented a policy of systematic assimilation with the ancient Viet people. This policy was continually enforced over the next 1,000 years of Chinese rule of Vietnam until the Ng\u00f4 Dynasty when the Vietnamese regained their independence from China. The Vietnamese emperors deported some 87,000 Chinese nationals, although a large minority applied for permanent residency in Vietnam. Chinese who chose to remain in Vietnam chose to assimilate. Vietnamese women were wedded by new Chinese gentry migrants. A revolt against China was mounted by Ly Bon who himself was of Chinese descent.The founder of the Early L\u00fd Dynasty, Emperor L\u00fd B\u00f4n, who rebelled against the Liang Dynasty came from a family of Chinese descent, the ancestors of his family were Chinese who fled to Vietnam from Wang Mang's seizure of power during the interregnum between the Western and Eastern Han dynasties.Cham people bought a young Chinese slave called Fan Wen who originated from the city of Yangzhou and he eventually became the King of Champa Linyi from 331\u2013349.Sporadic Chinese migration into Vietnam continued between the 9th to 15th century AD. The Vietnamese court during the L\u00fd Dynasty and the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty welcomed ethnic Chinese scholars and officials to fill into its administrative and bureaucratic ranks, but these migrants had to renounce their Chinese identity and assimilate into Vietnamese society. The Vietnamese court also allowed Chinese refugees, which consisted of civilian and military officials with their family members to seek asylum in Vietnam. However, these Chinese settlers were not allowed to change their place of residence without the Court's permission, and were also required to adopt Vietnamese dress and culture. During the Early L\u00ea dynasty some Chinese were captured in 995 after the Vietnamese raided the border. During the L\u00fd Dynasty Vietnam raided Song Dynasty China to enslave Chinese, who were forced to serve in the Vietnamese army as soldiers. In 1050 the Cham dedicated some Chinese slaves to their goddess Lady Po Nagar at the Po Nagar temple complex, along with Thai, Khmer, and Burmese slaves. It has been speculated by Professor Kenneth Hall that these slaves were war captives taken by the Cham from the port of Panduranga after the Cham conquered the port and enslaved all of its inhabitants, including foreigners living there. In the South, the Daoyi Zhilue also mentioned Chinese merchants who went to Cham ports in Champa, married Cham women, to whom they regularly returned to after trading voyages. One notable example of such intermarriages was Chinese merchant from Quanzhou, Wang Yuanmao, who in the 12th century traded extensively with Champa, and married a Cham princess. Chinese prisoners were returned to China for captured districts in 1078 after China defeated \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and overran several of Cao B\u1eb1ng Province's districts.The founder of the L\u00fd Dynasty, L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 (L\u00fd C\u00f4ng U\u1ea9n) \u674e\u516c\u860a has been ascribed of having origins from Fujian province somewhere in his paternal bloodline while little is known about his maternal side except for the fact that his mother was a woman named Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb. Very few direct details about his parents are known, however, the ethnic Chinese background of L\u00fd C\u00f4ng U\u1ea9n (\u674e\u516c\u860a [Hokkien POJ: L\u00ed kong \u00f9n]), at least on his paternal side has been accepted by Vietnamese historian Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u1ee3ng.The ancestors of the Tr\u1ea7n clan originated from the province of Fujian before they migrated under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh (\u9673\u4eac, [Hokkien POJ: T\u00e2n Kia\u207f / King]) to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, where their mixed-blooded descendants established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty which ruled \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. The descendants of the Tr\u1ea7n clan who came to rule \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t were of mixed-blooded descent due to many intermarriages between the Tr\u1ea7n and several royal members of the L\u00fd dynasty alongside members of their royal court as in the case of Tr\u1ea7n L\u00fd and Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1eeba, the latter whose son Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng would later become the first emperor of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty. Their descendants established the Tran dynasty, which ruled Vietnam (Dai Viet). Some of the mixed-blooded descendants and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese, as when a Yuan dynasty envoy met with the Chinese-speaking Tran Prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n in 1282. The first of the Tr\u1ea7n clan to live in \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was Tr\u1ea7n Kinh, who settled in T\u1ee9c M\u1eb7c village (now M\u1ef9 L\u1ed9c, Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh) who lived by fishing.Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like  Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song. The ancestor of the Tran, Tr\u1ea7n Kinh had originated from the present day Fujian province of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\". He quoted the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t S\u1eed K\u00fd To\u00e0n Th\u01b0 which said \u201cWhen the Song [Dynasty] was lost, its people came to us. Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt took them in. There was Zhao Zhong who served as his personal guard. Therefore, among the accomplishments in defeating the Yuan [i.e., Mongols], Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt had the most.\u201dSouthern Song Chinese military officers and civilian officials left to overseas countries, went to Vietnam and intermarried with the Vietnamese ruling elite and went to Champa to serve the government there as recorded by Zheng Sixiao. Southern Song soldiers were part of the Vietnamese army prepared by emperor Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng against the second Mongol invasion.A Vietnamese woman and a Chinese man were the parents of Ph\u1ea1m Nhan (Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00e1 Linh). He fought against the Tran for the Yuan dynasty. Dong Trieu was his mother's place.\nFujian was the origin of the ethnic Chinese Tran who migrated to Vietnam along with a large amount of other Chinese during the Ly dynasty where they served as officials. Distinct Chinese last names are found in the Tran and Ly dynasty Imperial examination records. Ethnic Chinese are recorded in Tran and Ly dynasty records of officials. Clothing, food, and language were all Chinese dominated in Van Don where the Tran had moved to after leaving their home province of Fujian. The Chinese language could still be spoken by the Tran in Vietnam. The ocean side area of Vietnam was colonized by Chinese migrants from Fujian which included the Tran among them located to the capital's southeastern area. The Red River Delta was subjected to migration from Fujian including the Tran and Van Don port arose as a result of this interaction. Guangdong and Fujian Chinese moved to the Halong located Van Don coastal port during Ly Anh Tong's rule in order to engage in commerce. The usurpation of the Ly occurred after they married with the fishing Fujianese Tran family.China's province of Zhejiang around the 940s was the origin of the Chinese H\u1ed3/H\u00fa family from which H\u1ed3 Dynasty founder Emperor H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly came from.The Vietnamese elites who were descended from mixed marriages between Chinese and Vietnamese viewed other non Vietnamese people as beneath them and inferior due to Chinese influence.While Northern Vietnam Kinh people assimilated Han Chinese immigrants into their population, have a sinicized culture and carry the patrilineal Han Chinese O-M7 haplogroup, Cham people carry the patrilineal R-M17 haplogroup of South Asian Indian origin from South Asian merchants spreading Hinduism to Champa and marrying Cham females since Chams have no matrilineal South Asian mtdna and this fits with the matrilocal structure of Cham families. Analysis of Vietnamese Kinh people's genetics show that within the last 800 years there was mixture between a Malay-like ancestral component and a Chinese ancestral component that happens to fit the time period in which Kinh expanded south from their Red river delta homeland in Nam ti\u1ebfn which also matches the event 700 years ago when the Cham population suffered massive losses. With the exception of Cham who are Austronesian speaking and Mang who are Austroasiatic speaking, the southern Han Chinese and all other ethnic groups in Vietnam share ancestry.\n\n\n=== Early immigration: 15th-18th centuries ===\nAfter the Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam it was recorded that the union of Vietnamese women and Chinese (Ng\u00f4)  men produced offspring which were left behind in Vietnam, and the Chams, C\u1ea9u Hi\u1ec3m, Laotians, these people, and Vietnamese natives who collaborated with the Ming were made into slaves of the Le government in the Complete Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t.There was no mandatory required reparation of the voluntarily remaining Ming Chinese in Vietnam. The return of the Ming Chinese to China was commanded by the Ming and not Le Loi. The Trai made up the supporters of Le Loi in his campaign. He lived among the Trai at the border regions as their leader and seized the Ming ruled lowland Kinh areas after originally forming his base in the southern highland regions. The southern dwelling Trai and Red River dwelling Vietnamese were in effect locked in a \"civil war\" during the anti Ming rebellion by Le Loi.The leader L\u01b0u B\u00e1c C\u00f4ng (Liu Bogong) in 1437 commanded a Dai Viet military squad made out of ethnic Chinese since even after the independence of Dai Viet, Chinese remained behind. Vietnam received Chinese defectors from Yunnan in the 1400s.The Chinese living in the Mekong Delta area settled there before any Vietnamese settled in the region. When the Ming Dynasty fell, several thousand Chinese refugees fled south and extensively settled on Cham lands and in Cambodia. Most of these Chinese were young males, and they took Cham women as wives. Their children identified more with Chinese culture. This migration occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 17th century many Chinese men from southeastern Chinese provinces like Fujian continued to move to southeast Asia, including Vietnam, many of the Chinese married native women after settling down in places like H\u1ed9i An.In the 16th century, L\u00ea Anh T\u00f4ng of the L\u00ea Dynasty encouraged traders to visit Vietnam by opening up Th\u0103ng Long (Hanoi), Hu\u1ebf and H\u1ed9i An. Chinese presence in the Hu\u1ebf/H\u1ed9i An area dated back as early as 1444, when a monk from Fujian built the Buddhist temple, Chua Chuc Thanh. H\u1ed9i An quickly developed into a trading port from the 16th century onwards, when Chinese and Japanese traders began to arrive in the city in greater numbers. When an Italian Jesuit priest, Father Christofo Borri, visited the city in 1618, he aptly described the city as: \"The city of Faifo is so vast that one would think it is two juxtaposed cities; a Chinese city and a Japanese city.\" The Japanese traders quickly disappeared by the first half of the 17th century as Tokugawa shogunate imposed a policy of self-isolation, and when Dutch traders such as Francisco Groemon visited H\u1ed9i An in 1642, the Japanese population was no more than 50 people, while the Chinese numbered some 5,000 individuals.Han Chinese Ming dynasty refugees numbering 3,000 came to Vietnam at the end of the Ming dynasty. They opposed the Qing dynasty and were fiercely loyal to the Ming dynasty. Vietnamese women married these Han Chinese refugees since most of them were soldiers and single men. Their descendants became known as Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng and they strongly identified as Chinese despite influence from Vietnanese mothers. They did not wear Manchu hairstyle unlike later Chinese migrants to Vietnam during the Qing dynasty.H\u1ed9i An was also the first city to take on refugees from the Ming Dynasty following the Manchu conquest. An association for these refugees, commonly referred to as \"Ming-Huong-Xa (\u660e\u9999\u793e)\" first appeared between 1645\u201353. Around this time, H\u1ed9i An and Vietnamese territories further south were under the control of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, and the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers allowed Vietnamese refugees to freely settle in disputed frontier lands with remnants of the Champa kingdom and the Khmer empire. According to the Dai Nam Chronicle, a Chinese general from Guangxi, Duong Ngan Dich led a band of 3,000 Ming loyalists to Hu\u1ebf to seek asylum. The Nguy\u1ec5n court allowed Duong and his followers to resettle in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, which had been newly acquired from the Khmers. Duong's followers named their settlement as \"Minh Huong\", to recall their allegiance to the Ming Dynasty. More Chinese refugees followed suit to settle in H\u1ed9i An and the frontier territory in Cochinchina such as M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu, who had earlier settled in the Kampot\u2013H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean area in the 1680s under the patronage of the Cambodian king, Chey Chettha IV. However, Cambodia fell into Thai rule under Taksin, and, in 1708, M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu switched his alliance to the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, paying tribute to Hu\u1ebf. M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu was given autonomy to rule Ha Tien in return for his tribute, and throughout the 18th century his descendants implemented their own administrative policies, independent of Hu\u1ebf and Cambodia. The presence of these semi-autonomous fiefdoms run by Chinese refugees encouraged more Chinese to settle in the South. In contrast, very few Chinese refugees chose to settle in territories controlled by the Tr\u1ecbnh lords, who still mandated Chinese refugees to strictly follow Vietnamese customs and refrain from contacts with the local Vietnamese populace in the cities.Vietnamese women were wedded as wives of the Han Chinese Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng \u660e\u9109 who moved to Vietnam during the Ming dynasty's fall. They formed a new group of people in Vietnamese society and worked for the Nguy\u1ec5n government. Both Khmer and Vietnamese women wedded the Chinese men of the Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng. Chinese culture was practiced by these Chinese men despite them marrying Vietnamese women. Ha tien came under the control of Mo Jiu (Ma Cuu), a Chinese who was among the Mekong Delta Ming migrants. Lang Cau, Cam Pho, Chiem, and Cu Lao in Hoi An were the sites of settlement by Minh Huong who were the result of native women becoming wives of Fujianese Chinese. The Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng community descended from Vietnamese wedding youthful Chinese men in Cochinchina and Hoi An in Nguy\u1ec5n lands. This new migration established a distinct Chinese diaspora group in Vietnam which was unlike in ancient times when the Vietnamese upper class absorbed ethnic Chinese who had come. Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng were ethnically hyrid Chinese and Vietnamese descended from Chinese men and Vietnamese women. They lived in rural areas and in urban areas. Chinese citizens in Vietnam were groups as Huaqiao by the French while the Minh Huong were permanent residents of Vietnam who were ethnic Chinese. To make commerce easier, Vietnamese female merchants wedded Chinese male merchants wedded in Hoi An. Tr\u1ea7n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Xuy\u00ean and D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u1ea1n \u0110\u1ecbch were two Chinese leaders who in 1679 brought Minh Huong to South Vietnam to live under the Nguyen Lords.\nThe Ming Chinese refugees were mostly male immigrants who generally married local Vietnamese or Khmer women while fostering a strong Chinese cultural identity in their descendants. Chinese trade and immigration began to increase towards the earlier half of the 18th century as population and economic pressures encouraged more Chinese men to seek trade opportunities in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. It was around this time that the descendants of the Ming Chinese refugees\u2013often referred to as Ming Huong Chinese\u2013begin to foster a separate ethno-cultural identity from the newer Chinese immigrants, whom they refer to as \"Thanh Nhan (\u6e05\u4eba)\", or Qing people. The Thanh Nhan form independent Chinese associations along the same dialect group or clans in cities and towns where large populations prevail, including Cholon, H\u1ed9i An and some towns in the Mekong Delta. The Minh Huong Chinese also formed similar associations, and notable examples include the \u0110\u00ecnh Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng Gia Th\u1ea1nh in Cholon, and the Dinh Tien Hien Lang Minh Huong in H\u1ed9i An. Both groups of Chinese were also very active in the interior affairs of Vietnamese society; notable Minh Huong Chinese such as Trinh Hoai Duc and Ngo Nhan Tinh who became ministers under the Nguy\u1ec5n court during Gia Long's reign. Many Thanh Nhan Chinese also participated as ragtag militia during the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion, although their loyalties were divided based on their location of residence. The Thanh Nhan Chinese in Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh and Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a sided with Gia Long, whereas some Chinese in the Mekong Delta regions sided with the Khmers until the late 1790s.\n\n\n=== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty and French rule: 19th\u201320th centuries ===\n\nThe Thanh Nhan Chinese made their living by exporting rice to other Southeast Asian countries, and their participation increased greatly in the years during the early 18th century after the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion. Under local laws, rice exports to other countries was tightly regulated, but the Chinese largely ignored this rule and exported rice en masse. The prices of rice witnessed an increase of 50\u2013100% in the 1820s as a result of these exports, which irked the Nguy\u1ec5n court under Emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng. Minh M\u1ea1ng's mandarin, L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t noticed that the Chinese had a great autonomy over trade affairs in Gia Dinh, which was partly attributed to the patronage of Trinh Hoai Duc who was serving as the governor of the province. Minh M\u1ea1ng introduced a new series of measures to curb Chinese trade from 1831 onwards, and started by introducing new restrictions to which residents are banned from overseas travel, which culminated in a brief revolt among Gia Dinh's residents in 1833. The Nguy\u1ec5n court also experimented with measures to assimilate the Chinese immigrants; in 1839 an edict was issued to abolish the Chinese clan associations in Vietnamese-ruled Cambodia, which proved to be ineffective. Minh M\u1ea1ng's son, Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb, introduced a new law to allow only Chinese-born immigrants to register with the Chinese clan associations, whereas their local born male descendants are allowed to register with the Minh-Huong-xa and adorn the Vietnamese costume. The Nguy\u1ec5n court also showed signs of subtle discrimination against people of Chinese origin; only one Minh Huong Chinese was promoted to a Mandarin. This sharply contrasted with the high representation of people of Chinese descent who were able to serve the Nguy\u1ec5n court under Gia Long's reign.Chinese immigration into Vietnam visibly increased following the French colonisation of Vietnam from 1860 onwards following the signing of the Convention of Peking whereby the rights of Chinese to seek employment overseas were officially recognised by the Chinese, British and French authorities. Unlike their Vietnamese predecessors, the French were very receptive of these Chinese immigrants as it provided an opportunity to stimulate trade and industry, and they generally found employment as labourers or middlemen. The French established a special Immigration Bureau in 1874 requiring Chinese immigrants to register with the Chinese clan and dialect group associations and eased trade restrictions that were previously in place. Historians such as Khanh Tran viewed this as a divide-and-rule policy, and the intention of its implementation was to minimise the chances of any internal revolt against the French authorities. The Chinese population nevertheless witnessed an exponential increase in the late 19th century and more so in the 20th century; between the 1870s and 1890s, some 20,000 Chinese settled in Cochinchina. Another 600,000 arrived in the 1920s and 1930s, and peaks in the migration patterns was especially pronounced during the 1920s and late 1940s when the effects of fighting and economic instability arising from the Chinese Civil War became pronounced.Crocodiles were eaten by Vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese. Vietnamese women who married Chinese men adopted the Chinese taboo.Vietnamese women were wedded to the Chinese who helped sell Viet Minh rice. Customarily intermarriage between Chinese and Vietnamese consisted of Vietnamese female exogamy, as Chinese families allowed Chinese men to marry Vietnamese women, but were reluctant to have Vietnamese men marry Chinese women due to a sense of ethnic superiority.\n\n\n=== Statehood under North Vietnam and South Vietnam: 1950\u20131975 ===\nAt a party plenum in 1930, the Indochinese Communist Party made a statement that the Chinese were to be treated on an equal footing with the Vietnamese, specifically defining them as \"The workers and labourers among the Chinese nationals are allies of the Vietnamese revolution\". One year after the state of North Vietnam was established, a mutual agreement was made between the Communist Party of China and Communist Party of Vietnam to give ethnic Chinese living in North Vietnam Vietnamese citizenship. This process was completed by the end of the 1950s.Stores owned by Vietnamese and Chinese were robbed and Vietnamese women were attacked by Frenchmen who had been jailed during the occupation of Indochina by the Japanese.Around the same time in South Vietnam, President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m issued a series of measures between 1955 and 1956 to integrate the ethnic Chinese into South Vietnamese society:\n\n7 December 1955: A nationality law was passed which automatically qualified Vietnamese residents of mixed Chinese and Vietnamese parentage as South Vietnamese citizens.\n21 August 1956: Decree 48 was passed which made all ethnic Chinese born in Vietnam South Vietnamese citizens, irrespective of their family wishes. First-generation immigrants who were born in China, however, were not allowed to apply for Vietnamese citizenship and had to apply for residential permits that were to be renewed periodically, on top of paying residential taxes.\n29 August 1956: Decree 52 was passed which required all Vietnamese citizens regardless of their ethnic origin to adopt a Vietnamese name within six months, failing which they had to pay a heavy fine.\n6 September 1956: Decree 53 was issued which prohibited all foreigners from engaging in eleven different trades, all of which were dominated by ethnic Chinese. The foreign shareholders were required to liquidate their business or transfer their ownership to Vietnamese citizens within 6 months to 1 year, and failure to do so would result in deportation or a fine of up to 5 million piastres.As most ethnic Chinese in Vietnam were holders of ROC nationality in 1955, the measures greatly reduced the number of expatriate Chinese in South Vietnam. The fourth decree in particular had the effect of encouraging Chinese businessmen to transfer their assets to their local-born children. In 1955, the number of ROC nationals stood at 621,000, which was greatly reduced to 3,000 by 1958. The South Vietnamese government later relaxed its stance to foreign-born Chinese in 1963, and a new nationality law was passed to allow them the choice to retain their ROC nationality or adopt South Vietnamese citizenship. The following year, the Statistics Office created a new census category, \"Nguoi Viet goc Hoa\" (Vietnamese people of Chinese origin), whereby Vietnamese citizens of Chinese heritage were identified as such in all official documents. No further major measures were implemented to integrate or assimilate the Chinese after 1964. The Chinese sought cultural and economic pursuits more actively during President Thi\u1ec7u's rule, especially in the manufacturing, finance and transport industries. At the grassroots level, ethnic Vietnamese resentment against the Chinese was widespread for their dominance over the South Vietnamese economy.In North Vietnam, the initially favorable situation of the Chinese minority began to deteriorate during the Vietnam War. In 1967\u20131968, friction started to occur in Sino-DRV relations, because the People's Republic of China disapproved both Hanoi\u2019s broadening cooperation with the Soviet Union and the North Vietnamese decision to start negotiations with the U.S. in Paris. Inspired by the Chinese embassy, the official newspaper of the ethnic Chinese community published a number of anti-Soviet articles until the DRV authorities replaced its editors with some more compliant cadres. Anxious to prevent Beijing from exerting a political influence on the Chinese minority, in the early 1970s the North Vietnamese leaders resorted to various methods of forced assimilation. At first they sought to pressure ethnic Chinese to adopt Vietnamese citizenship, but only a handful of Hoa cadres complied, most of whom were heavily assimilated individuals anyway. Thereupon the authorities attempted to seize the Chinese passports of the ethnic Chinese under various pretexts, but most Hoa refused to give up their passports. The regime made repeated efforts to transform the Chinese minority schools into mixed Chinese-Vietnamese schools in which Hoa children were to study together with Vietnamese pupils and the curriculum was to be based on the standard North Vietnamese curriculum. The authorities ceased to hire Hoa interpreters, nor did they employ Hoa in offices that were in regular contact with foreigners. Ethnic Chinese were rarely admitted to the military, and even if they volunteered for service, they could serve only in logistical units but not in troops sent to the front in South Vietnam. Following the Battle of the Paracel Islands (a Chinese action that Hanoi disapproved), the DRV authorities started to hinder the Hoa in visiting their relatives in the PRC.\n\n\n=== Departure from Vietnam: 1975\u20131990 ===\nFollowing reunification of Vietnam, the Hoa bore the brunt of socialist transformation in the South. The control and regulation of markets was one of the most sensitive and persistent problems faced by the government following the beginning of North\u2013South integration in 1975. The government, in its doctrinaire efforts to communize the commercial, market-oriented Southern economy, faced several paradoxes. The first was the need both to cultivate and to control commercial activity by ethnic Chinese in the South, especially in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Chinese businesses controlled much of the economic activity in Ho Chi Minh City and South Vietnam. Following Vietnam's break with China in 1978, some Vietnamese leaders evidently feared the potential for espionage activities within the Chinese business community. On the one hand, Chinese-owned concerns controlled trade in a number of goods and services, such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizer distribution, grain milling and foreign-currency exchange, that were supposed to be state monopolies. On the other hand, savvy Chinese entrepreneurs provided excellent access to markets for Vietnamese exports through Hong Kong and Singapore. This access became increasingly important in the 1980s as a way of circumventing the boycott on trade with Vietnam imposed by a number of Asian and Western Nations. An announcement on March 24 outlawed all wholesale trade and large business activities, which forced around 30,000 businesses to close down overnight, followed up by another that banned all private trade. Further government policies forced former owners to become farmers in the countryside or join the armed forces and fight at the Vietnam-Cambodia border, and confiscated all old and foreign currencies, as well as any Vietnamese currency in excess of the US value of $250 for urban households and $150 by rural households.While such measures were targeted at all bourgeois elements, such measures hurt Hoa the hardest and resulted in the expropriation of Hoa properties in and around major cities. Hoa communities offered widespread resistance and clashes left the streets of Cholon \"full of corpses\".  These measures, combined with external tensions stemming from Vietnam's dispute with Cambodia and China in 1978 and 1979 caused an exodus of the majority of the Hoa, of whom more than 170,000 fled overland into the province of Guangxi, China, from the North and the remainder fled by boat from the South. China received a daily influx of 4\u20135,000 refugees, while Southeast Asian countries saw a wave of 5,000 boat people arriving at their shores each month. China sent unarmed ships to help evacuate the refugees, but encountered diplomatic problems as the Vietnamese government denied that the Hoa suffered persecution and later refused to issue exit permits after as many as 250,000 Hoa had applied for repatriation. In an attempt to stem the refugee flow, avert Vietnamese accusations that Beijing was coercing its citizens to emigrate and encourage Vietnam to change its policies towards ethnic Hoa, China closed off its land border in 1978. This led to a jump in the number of boat people, with as many as 100,000 arriving in other countries by the end of 1978. However, the Vietnamese government by now not only encouraged the exodus, but took the opportunity to profit from it by extorting a price of five to ten taels of gold or an equivalent of US $1,500 to $3,000 per person wishing to leave the country. The Vietnamese military also forcibly drove the thousands of border refugees across the China-Vietnam land border, causing numerous border incidents and armed clashes, while blaming these movements on China by accusing them of using saboteurs to force Vietnamese citizens into China. This new influx brought the number of refugees in China to around 200,000. One family was split. An ethnic Chinese man was deported while his ethnic Vietnamese wife and child were left behind.The size of the exodus increased during and after the war. The monthly number of boat people arriving in Southeast Asia increased to 11,000 during the first quarter of 1979, 28,000 by April, and 55,000 in June, while more than 90,000 fled by boat to China. In addition, the Vietnamese military also began expelling ethnic Hoa from Vietnamese-occupied Cambodia, leading to over 43,000 refugees of mostly Hoa descent fleeing overland to Thailand. By now, Vietnam was openly confiscating the properties and extorting money from fleeing refugees. In April 1979 alone, Hoa outside of Vietnam had remitted a total of US $242 million (an amount equivalent to half the total value of Vietnam's 1978 exports) through Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City to help their friends or family pay their way out of Vietnam. By June, money from refugees had replaced the coal industry as Vietnam's largest source of foreign exchange and was expected to reach as much as 3 billion in US dollars. By 1980, the refugee population in China reached 260,000, and the number of surviving boat people refugees in Southeast Asia reached 400,000. (An estimated 50% to 70% of Vietnamese and Chinese boat people perished at sea.)\n\n\n=== \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi (since 1986) ===\nAfter Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh initiated the Vietnamese economic reforms in 1986, the Hoa in Vietnam has witnessed a massive commercial resurgence and despite many years being persecuted began to regain much of their power in the Vietnamese economy. The open-door policy and economic reforms of Vietnam, as well as the improved economic and diplomatic relations of Vietnam with other Southeast Asian countries has revived the entrepreneurial presence of the predominantly urban Chinese minority of the roles they previously played in the Vietnamese economy.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe official census from 2019 accounted the Hoa population at 749,466 individuals and ranked 9th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns in which they make up the largest minority group, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the remainder live in the countryside in the southern provinces. The Hoa had constituted the largest ethnic minority group in the mid 20th century and its population had previously peaked at 1.2 million, or about 2.6% of Vietnam's population in 1976 a year following the end of the Vietnam War. Just 3 years later, the Hoa population dropped to 935,000 as large swathes of Hoa left Vietnam. The 1989 census indicated the Hoa population had appreciated to 960,000 individuals, but their proportion had dropped to 1.5% by then. In 1999, the Hoa population at some 860,000 individuals, or approximately 1.1% of the country's population and by then, were ranked Vietnam's 4th largest ethnic group. The Hoa population are mainly concentrated in Cochinchina, and a 1943 census indicated that they made up the bulk (89%) of the Hoa population of Vietnam, or about 7% of Cochinchina's population.\n\n\n=== Ancestral affiliations ===\nThe Hoa trace their ancestral origins to different parts of China many centuries ago and they are identified based on the dialects that they speak. In cities where large Chinese communities exist such as H\u1ed9i An and Saigon, Chinese communities set up clan associations that identify themselves based on surnames or their ancestral homeland. In Vietnam, five different dialects are recognized within the Hoa community, with the Cantonese forming the largest group. Each of these Hoa sub-groups tend to congregate in different towns and one dialect group may predominate over the others.\n\n\n== Trade and industry ==\n\n\n=== Early history and French colonial rule (3rd century BC\u20131945) ===\nChinese economic imperialism in Vietnam dates back to 208 B.C., when the renegade Qin Chinese general Zhao Tuo defeated An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng, the king of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c in north Vietnam and conquered the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c Kingdom, an ancient Vietnamese state situated in the northern mountains of modern Vietnam populated by the ancient L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t and \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t. He annexed \u00c2u L\u1ea1c into the Qin Empire the following year and declared himself the emperor of Nam Viet. A century later, the Han dynasty annexed Nanyue into the Han Empire and was ruled as a province for the next several hundred years. Sinification of Nanyue was brought about by a combination of Han imperial military power, regular settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees, officers and garrisons, merchants, scholars, bureaucrats, fugitives, and prisoners of war. By the end of the 17th century, a distinct Chinese community, known as the Hoa, formed within Vietnamese society. Ethnic Chinese enclaves and small Chinatowns took root in many Vietnamese cities and trading centers. Large congregations of Chinese immigrants coupled with their economic power allowed the establishment of insttitions to their regulate business activities and protect their economic interests. Modern Chinese settlement and immigration in Vietnam came about from conducive opportunities for trade and business. Ethnic Chinese businessmen began to visit H\u1ed9i An from the 16th century onward and initially traded black incense, silk, alum and Chinese medicinal products with the local Vietnamese. Dutch, Portuguese and French merchants who visited H\u1ed9i An in the 17th century brought high quality European made brass utensils that attracted the attention of the Chinese. In turn, other Hoa manufactured goods such as porcelain, silver bars and various metals were traded. Around this time, the local Chinese community began to establish their own trading and social associations, the latter of which is referred to as bang in Vietnamese to protect their own economic interests. The bang also provided various welfare services for new Chinese immigrants, including financial services such as the collection of taxes. As more immigrants poured in the 19th century, the bang served as meeting points for Chinese community leaders to band together to pool seed capital and establish their own businesses.The Hoa were notoriously enterprising entrepreneurs that traded and manufactured a myriad of good and services of value ranging from Chinese silk to black incense. The monopolized gold export trade was entirely in Chinese hands in addition to Chinese domination of local trade in paper, tea, pepper, arms, sulphur, lead, and lead oxide. The economic clout held by the Hoa coupled with repeated attempts by China to conquer Vietnam inflamed anti-Chinese hostility, bitterness, and resentment from the Vietnamese Kinh. Hostility against Chinese economic success sparked recurrent anti-Hoa reprisals, including the infamous 1782 massacre of some 2000 Hoa in Cholon, Saigon's Chinatown. The 1782 massacre in which an estimated ten thousand Chinese were slaughtered. According to official Vietnamese records, Chinese shops were burned and looted, and the victims, including \"men, women, and children,\" were indiscriminately \"killed and their corpses thrown into the river.\" Chinese imperialism continued to grow following the establishment of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty in 1802. As wealthy Chinese merchants and investors served as a source of tax revenue and political interests of the Nguyen officials. By the time the French arrived in the mid-19th century, Hoa held a controlled and dominated the indigenousVietnamese majority in trade, mining, and every urban market sector in addition to prospering under the colonial laissez faire market policies enshrined by the French colonialists. Vietnam's gold industry in particular, was entirely monopolized by Chinese merchants. Hoa entirely monopolized the internal procurement and distribution system. In 1865, Chinese merchants in Cholon created contacts with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank to export rice and other agricultural products to China. By 1874, there were fourteen rice exporting companies owned the Chinese competing with ten European import-export businesses. The Grain Merchants Association with its headquarters in Cholon had direct contracts with rice markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and British Malaya. The French colonial regime saw the advantage of market expertise offered by the Chinese and allowed Chinese merchants to freely engage in external trade; sometimes leading to a certain amount of cooperation between the French and Chinese in both import and export. The French would shrewdly and astutely cultivate and champion Chinese entrepreneurship. The French colonial administrators welcomed Chinese immigrants and saw their importance in paving the way for French colonial rule as well as sustaining economic prosperity within it. The Hoa population rose from 25,000 in the 1860s to more than 200,000 in 1911. In addition, Hoa also served as intermediaries operating as agents for the French as well as their own. Hoa also collaborated with the French and other European capitalists in tapping the natural riches and exploiting the Kinh Vietnamese via the laissez faire economic system to become wealthy. During the colonial era, imports were completely under the control by the French authorities. Almost all the major import items such as machinery, transport equipment, and building materials, and luxury goods were undertaken by French companies, while the Chinese acted as middlemen for a commission. Under French rule, the collection of paddy in the Mekong delta was completely under Chinese hands who resold it to French companies for export. Industrial commodities imported from France by French companies in Vietnam were retailed to the rural population in the South by Hoa merchants, with some of them holding exclusive distribution rights.\n\n\n=== South Vietnamese rule (1945\u20131975) ===\nBy the 1950s, the Hoa had held such vast amounts of economic power and political influence, that they were viewed as \"a state within a state\", forming a more distinct cosmopolitan and wealthier population than the host Vietnamese majority. The economic success of the Hoa \u200cinflamed local Kinh resentment and hostility. The Hoa had a huge propensity to live apart from the Vietnamese, typically associating themselves with the Chinese community at large, attending Chinese institutions, marrying their within their ethnic community, and projected a sense of \"superiority\" and distinct sense of \"ethnic and cultural exclusivity\". After the French withdrew from Vietnam in the 1950s, the Ngo Dinh Diem government tried to Vietnamize the economy and reduce Chinese and French participation while trying to increase the indigenous Vietnamese involvement to gain a proportionate presence. Indigenous Kinh Vietnamese entrepreneurs were unable to compete with the Hoa and ultimately lost out to them due to lack of capital and business ties outside Vietnam.In 1961, Hoa controlled 80 percent of all the capital in the retail trade and 75 percent of Vietnam's commercial activities. Utilizing the Confucian paradigm of personal networks, Hoa have dominated several types of businesses such as financial services, food, information technology, chemicals, electronic and electrical equipment, machinery, fabricated metals, wholesale trade, transportation equipment, and other miscellaneous services. Constituting a mere 1 percent of Vietnam's population, Hoa controlled an estimated 90 percent of non-European private capital in the mid-1960s and dominated Vietnam's entire retail trade, financial services, manufacturing, and transportation sectors, and all aspects of the country's rice economy. In the hospitality and tourist sector, Hoa owned more than 50 percent of all the largest hotels and 90 percent of small hotels and boarding houses in the Saigon-Cholon and Gia Dinh areas, in addition to 92 large restaurants, 243 tea and beer shops, 48 hotels, and 826 eating houses. Hoa controlled much of the restaurants, drink and hotel, amusement and recreation, medical, educational, and other miscellaneous establishments and services. Hoa businessmen operated restaurants and hotels as a stepping stone as these businesses turned in a quick profit while requiring very little initial startup capital. Furthermore, hospitality businesses were not regulated by government or local discriminatory policies. Although there were also numerous wealthy Vietnamese in the commercial class, the disproportionate amount economic power held by the Hoa minority led to resentment from the indigenous Vietnamese Kinh majority. The Hoa were also the pioneers of the Vietnamese banking industry. Early in the twentieth century, the Franco-Chinese bank was jointly established by French and Hoa businessmen in Saigon-Cholon. Within five years, its capital grew from 10 million to 50 million francs. The Chinese community would soon go on to establish their own banks providing capital to rice merchants and operating their own pawnshops. During the early years of the Republic of Vietnam, Chinese controlled three of the ten private banks while the rest were French and British owned. Furthermore, Chinese also controlled foreign Chinese banks such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of East Asia. In South Vietnam, 28 of the 32 banks were controlled by the Hoa and ethnic Chinese capital accounted for 49 percent of the total capital invested in eleven local private banks in 1974. The Chinese also ran the bank's Chinese Affairs Office to serve the Hoa business community. Before 1975, Chinese capital, entrepreneurship, and skilled manpower in South Vietnam played an important role in developing domestic markets and international trade.In 1970, it was estimated that while Hoa made up only 5.3 percent of the total population, they reputedly controlled 70 to 80 percent of the entire commercial sector of Vietnam. In 1971, ethnic Chinese controlled 2492 shops or 41 percent of all the small and medium-sized shops in Saigon-Cholon's nine districts. In addition, ethnic Chinese controlled the entire wholesale trade and 50 percent of the retail trade of the South before 1975. With regards to exports, Hoa businessmen established their own business networks with their compatriots in Mainland China and other Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Chinese businesses controlled much of the economic activity in Saigon in South Vietnam where the Chinese controlled 80 percent of South Vietnam's overall industry despite making up a tiny percentage of South Vietnam's population. Before the Fall of Saigon, ethnic Chinese controlled 40.9 percent of the small scale enterprises, 100 percent of the wholesale trade in South Vietnam, transitioning from smaller-scale retail firms to larger wholesale enterprises. Chinese enterprises made up 45.6 percent of all the enterprises handling the import trade in the early 1970s. In addition 815 of the 966 direct and indirect importers in 1971 were controlled by the Chinese along with 300 Chinese shipping companies in Ho Chi Minh City alone as well as fifty large Chinese agents for agricultural, sea, and forestry products. By 1974, Chinese investment in the field of amusement and recreation was 20 percent and made up 80 percent of the total investment in medical and health services sector. At the end of 1974, the Hoa controlled more than 80 percent of the food, textile, chemical, metallurgy, engineering, and electrical industries, 100 percent of wholesale trade, more than 50 percent of retail trade, and 90 percent of export-import trade. Dominance over the economy enabled the Hoa to \"manipulate prices\" of rice and other scarce goods. During the Vietnam War, the wealth of the Hoa increased dramatically and intensified as they seized lucrative business opportunities that came with the arrival of the American troops, who needed a trade and services network to serve their military needs. The war prompted the South Vietnamese government gradually deregulated the economy, adopting relatively liberal market policies that caused the local Hoa to exploit local business opportunities as well as extending their economic dominance into the light industry. Throughout the war, Hoa took advantage of U.S. aid and expanded not only their trade and services networks but also their operations in other domains. Ethnic Chinese controlled nearly all the keys sectors of South Vietnam's economy such as trade, industry, banking, communications, and transportation. Of more than $100 billion poured into the war effort by the United States, a disproportionate amount ended up in the hands of the Chinese, effectively enriching the Chinese minority and intensifying the wealth and economic power held in Chinese hands. In 1972, Hoa owned 28 of the 32 banks in South Vietnam, handled more than 60 percent of the total volume of goods imported into South Vietnam through U.S. aid, and comprised 84 percent of the direct and indirect shipping importers. The Hoa controlled nearly two-thirds of the amount of cash in circulation, 80 percent of the processing industry, 80 percent of the fixed assets in manufacturing, 100 percent of the wholesale trade, 50 percent of the retail trade, and 90 percent of the export and import trade. Hoa completely monopolized 100 percent of the grain trade and obtained 80 percent of the credits from South Vietnamese banks, owning 42 out of the 60 companies with a turnover of more than 1 billion piasters including major banks, and accounted for two-thirds of the total annual investments inn the South. Hoa controlled about 75 percent of the economic activity in South Vietnam in 1975, including 100 percent of the domestic wholesale trade, 80 percent of the industry, 70 percent of the foreign trade and presided over half the country's retail trade. Some 117 of the 670 leading Vietnamese business families were of Chinese descent.In Vietnamese business circles, the Hoa were dubbed as \"Crownless kings\", \"rice kings\", \"gasoline kings\", or \"scrap-iron kings\". Highly publicized profiles of wealthy Hoa entrepreneurs attracted great public interest and were used to illustrate the Chinese community's strong economic clout. The huge materials supply system ensured maximum support for ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs for whatever goods and services they provided to their clients. The market was allegedly calibrated so as to ensure maximum profits and manipulated prices through import-export and transport systems. Hoa also acted as agents for expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese investors outside of Vietnam that act as their underlying providers of economic intelligence. Under the Saigon administration, a rapid influx of Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs from Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan came to South Vietnam for business and investment activities. The Hoa compradore bourgeoisie in South Vietnam also had the economic and political backing of wealthy expatriate Chinese from Taiwan and Hong Kong and Overseas Chinese capitalists in the United States and other countries in Southeast Asia. As the Hoa entrepreneurs in South Vietnam became more financially prosperous, they often pooled large amounts of seed capital and started joint business ventures with expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese businessmen and investors from all over the world. In addition, prominent Hoa compradore bourgeoisie often colluding and mingling with Saigon government officials and the South Vietnamese army elite to attain even greater wealth. The most notorious of South Vietnam's Hoa compradore bourgeoisie was Ly Long Than, who reportedly held large assets in 18 major commercial and industrial manufacturing enterprises (Vinatexco and Vinafilco textile factories, Vinatefinco dye-works, Vicasa steel factory, Nakydaco edible oil factory, Rang Dong sea transport company, a real estate company, a plush hotel, an insurance provider, and many restaurants) and sixteen banks including the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, and the Agriculture Industry Commerce Bank. Foreign investors and visitors doing business in Cholon would recall seeing the plethora of import-export shipping giants, banks, modern high-rise buildings, plush hotels and nightclubs, and restaurants all owned by Hoa businessmen. Other Hoa compradore bourgeoisie capitalists include Hoan Kim Quy, a native of Hanoi where he owned a prominent shipping firm and made his fortune from barbed wire manufacturing, the operation of a large textile and appliance import company and a gold mining and trading firm. He was the Director of the Vitako Company and was a major shareholder in several banks.The control and regulation of markets was one of the most sensitive and persistent problems faced by the revolutionary government following the beginning of North\u2013South integration in 1975. The government, in its doctrinaire efforts to nationalize the commercial, market-oriented Southern economy, faced several paradoxes. The first was the need both to cultivate and to control commercial activity by ethnic Chinese in the South, especially in Ho Chi Minh City. Chinese businesses controlled much of the commerce in Ho Chi Minh City and the South generally. Following the break with China in 1978, some Vietnamese leaders evidently feared the potential for espionage activities within the Chinese commercial community. On the one hand, Chinese-owned concerns controlled trade in a number of commodities and services, such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizer distribution, grain milling, and foreign-currency exchange, that were supposed to be state monopolies. On the other hand, Hoa merchants provided excellent access to markets for Vietnamese exports through Hong Kong and Singapore. This access became increasingly important in the 1980s as a way of circumventing the boycott on trade with Vietnam imposed by a number of Asian and Western nations. Hoa have dominated several types of businesses such as selling rice, crewed junk, rice transportation, and ship building during their early arrival to Vietnam. Through enterprise, organization, and cooperation many Chinese became part of a prosperous, urban middle class that controlled the country's entire retail trade. Chinese retail shops filled every major Vietnamese town and sea route as rice selling and transportation were one of the most profitable businesses in the country. In addition, the Hoa became economically dominant in Saigon, where Chinese worked as vendors and sold an array of products as an industrious entrepreneurial ethnic group, producing much of the city's economic output. Many would then work as butchers and tailors, and then venture into confectionery. Many Chinese also worked as money lenders, bankers, and money changers. Products such as tea, porcelain, pharmaceuticals and medicine, furniture and cabinet-work were shipped to Vietnam from China. Government officials said the ethnic Chinese in Cholon were also politically active in municipal interests and the Vietnamese Communist Party, but their main interest was entrepreneurship. The Chinese feel secure in business as well as taking priorities in into focusing onto improving their social and cultural lives. About 20 percent of the 6,000 private companies and 150,000 individual small businesses in the city were run by Chinese. The Chinese accounted for more than 30 percent of Ho Chi Minh City's business output due to better equipment used by the businesses.In South Vietnam, Hoa controlled more than 90 percent of the non-European capital, 80 percent of the food, textile, chemical, metallurgy, engineering, and electrical industries, 100 percent of the wholesale trade, more than 50 percent of the retail trade, and 90 percent of the import-export trade. Economic dominance by the Hoa presided accusations from the indigenous Vietnamese majority who felt that they could not compete with Chinese businesses. With the Hoa's economic clout, it was noted by 1983 that more than 60 percent of southern Vietnam's bourgeoisie were of Chinese extraction. They controlled the entire rice paddy market and obtained up to 80 percent of the bank loans in the south. Hoa also owned 42 of the 60 corporations having a large annual turnover of more than 1 million dong and investments accounted for two-thirds of the total investment in South Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Reunification and Doi Moi (since 1975) ===\nFollowing Vietnam's reunification in 1976, the socialist and revolutionary Vietnamese government began using the Hoa as a scapegoat for their socioeconomic woes. The government referred the enterprising Chinese as \"bourgeois\" and perpetrators of \"world capitalism.\" Brutal draconian policies against the Chinese involved the \"Employing the techniques Hitler used to inflame hatred against the Jews\" as reported by the U.S. News and World Report's Ray Wallace in 1979 led many Hoa being persecuted by fleeing the country or death laboring in Vietnam's so-called \"new economic zones\". Despite undergoing many years of being persecuted by the socialist Vietnamese government, the Hoa have to begun to reassert and regain much of their economic clout in the Vietnamese economy. Since the early 1980s, the Vietnamese government has gradually reintegrated the Hoa into mainstream economic development. By 1986, the Chinese were actively encouraged to take part in parlaying the economic development of Vietnam. Hoa have once again begun contributing significantly to the expansion of Vietnamese internal markets and capital accumulation for small-scale industrial business development. In the 1990s, the commercial role and influence of Hoa in Vietnam's economy has rebounded substantially since Doi Moi as the Vietnamese government's post-1988 shift to free market liberalization has led to an astounding resurgence of ethnic Chinese economic dominance across the country's urban areas. Hoa have achieved prominence in the light industry, import-export trade, shopping malls, and private banking sector. In 1996, the Hoa continued to dominate Vietnam's private industry and was responsible for about $4 billion in business output making up one-fifth of Vietnam's total domestic business output.\n\n\n== Diaspora communities ==\n\nToday, there are many Hoa communities in Australia, Canada, France, United Kingdom and the United States, where they have reinvigorated old existing Chinatowns. For example, the established Chinatowns of Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, Toronto, Honolulu and Paris have a Vietnamese atmosphere due to the large presence of Hoa people.  Some of these communities also have associations for transplanted Hoa refugees such as the Association des R\u00e9sidents en France d'origine indochinoise in Paris.\nLittle Saigon in Orange County, California is also home to a significant Hoa diaspora community, along with Cabramatta in Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nThe Chinese Vietnamese population in China now number up to 300,000, and live mostly in 194 refugee settlements mostly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Fujian, Yunnan and Jiangxi. More than 85% have achieved economic independence, but the remainder live below the poverty line in rural areas. While they have most of the same rights as Chinese nationals, including employment, education, housing, property ownership, pensions, and health care, they had not been granted citizenship and continued to be regarded by the government as refugees. Their refugee status allowed them to receive UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) assistance and aid until the early 21st century. In 2007, the Chinese government began drafting legislation to grant full Chinese citizenship to Indochinese refugees, including the ethnic Hoa which make up the majority, living within its borders.\n\n\n== Data tables ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChina\u2013Vietnam relations\nIndochina refugee crisis\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== English ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nChinese Affairs Department of Ho Chi Minh City (in Vietnamese, Chinese, and English)\nPhoto album",

          "It is a typical temple for the chinese hokkien dialect community. Its architectural is unique with many meaningful mandarin poems on its walls. I am impressed to find such nicely preserved traditional cultural payer temple in Vietnam (Hoi An).",
          "I liked this temple best but like every monument in Hoi An you can pass by in 5 minutes and everything is filled with tourists, plastic and cheap souvenirs. Still I did found it amusing.",
          "We had a very good guide (thanks to Key from Hoi An Express Travel) which is a must to have the significant issues and customs of this ancient Chinese Temple explained in full. Note the Twelve Midwives who protect all Under-5's in Vietnam from danger (hence little children do",
          "Our guide took us there and showed us around. There were a lot of papers hanging in some kind of spiral forms where people wrote all kind of things. We decided to do it. You write on this tablet whatever you want or wish for and then its hooked to the spiral and then you light",
          "nice to have a little quiet time and just sit and relax and take in the spirit of the area. Good for rejuvenation",
          "Good to see the Assembly Hall. Lots of history here. lots of pictures taken. My gf explained some of the Cantonese history to me but it dates back alot of centuries. Over head has the round curly incense.",
          "Very turned the temple dedicated to the goddess who has the care of the people of the sea - Thien Hau. The garments of the goddess are changed every year. You should see this temple.",
          "We went to visit this assembly hall with a guide. It is interesting to understand the history. However the place is nothing yo wow about. We did not spend too much of a time in this place. I think if you run out of time, I will give this a miss.",
          "enjoyed the artistic detail of the hall and even splurged and wrote a blessing to hang in the incense",
          "The assembly hall was very nice with great gate, inner it is a multi function area as a hall, temple and pagoda. Nice place to visit.",
          "This was a really pretty and interesting assembly hall to visit. I enjoyed walking around taking photos. If you had a guide with you, it would be good to learn more about it.",
          "Hoi an is full of Dialect Assembly Hall. Hokkien is one of the rich in the society. Hence, more donation to build bigger assembly hall. After use the washroom, there will be an old lady pop up from nowhere to collect fee.",

          "Gaudy (fairly recent addition) gates greet you at the entrance to this former assembly hall, now temple. The grounds of this place provide a lovely, well kept spot to get a way from the hustle and bustle of Hoi An street life as well as being a great place to people watch and",

          "A pretty and calming temple. We found the outside areas particularly pretty and relaxing and included gorgeous mosaic sculptures. Relatively few visitors. To enter a series of historical buildings and temples, you need to buy a Hoi An Old Town ticket for about $6. Each ticket",
          "Stunning buildings, great place for photos, and shade and seats too. We were amazed at how few people there were here. Make this a visit, even if you only have a spare 1/2 hour",
          "it is located along the main Tran Phu street. the design of the roof is very unique. the vietnamies buddhist come here for their prayers. nice to walk around the compound of this temple. free entrance.",
          "This gate is quite unique to Vietnam i think as i have not seen one in China, Thailand or Cambodja. Therefore that was pretty neat, the rest of the place has just a few things to offer, and you will probably be outta here in about 10 min, but dont let that hold you from entering",
          "The assembly hall was one of the most interesting sites I visited in the Old Town. There is an ornate Buddhist temple and the grounds are lovely.",
          "This was one of our stops during the Ancient Town tour. You wouldn't expect how big it was considering how dense Ancient Town was but it went back quite far. I believe there was 4 different prayers room, each representing something else. The large spiral ceiling fixtures were",
          "Good example of ancient chinese culture presence in Vietnam and located in the center of Hoi An city centre",
          "If you had to choose one assembly halls to visit in Hoi An, I suggest either this or Quang Trieu as they are both photogenic with the intricate details of the entrance and within the assembly halls.",
          "Has a nice model of the Great Wall. Also a reproduction sailing ship and some impressive artwork, as well as the usual shrines.",
          "The ticket cost me 110 000 VND for 5 attractions in the ancient town, and I chose this as one of it due to the amazing architecture and the dragon edged design on the entrance, nice building colors reflection to the blue sky made it a good spot for photography lovers.",
          "Stepping inside the Assembly hall you automatically notice how peaceful and quiet it is coming off the busy old town street. The architecture is beautiful and extremely detailed. We had a tour guide who brought us here so he was able to tell us the history of the hall which was",
          "From the hussle and bussle outside,step inside tranquillity,take some photos and get your breath back.",
          "Nothing much to see inside. But better than other so called tourist attractions of Hoi An. Or if you want take some rest from the hot weather outside.",
          "One of the first attractions you come to having walked past the Japanese Covered Bridge. Attractive centre display with lots of dragons! Shrine at the end of the walkway and lovely gardens. Take your time, it's very hot. There's no rush. Get your pictures, but try and wait",

          "Our guide brought us here where we spent maybe 30 minutes or so looking around and learning about the history. It was quite interesting and very peaceful. If you have some time then worth a quick look.",
          "We went here on a rainy day when the temple was offering rice for poor people which is a very meaningful act to help local community. Interesting history and colorful temple",
          "Compare to its counterpart building nearby, I find this place more peaceful and calm with its architectural structure and design. worthy a visit in Hoi An Ancient town.",
          "The Assembly Hall is a great temple to visit when you get your tourist pass for the Old Town (you can buy a tourist pass in any of the tourist vendor shops in old town). We didn't have a guide when we visited, so it I believe we missed out on some of the rich history of this",
          "We went here as my wife's family comes from Fukian, but there is not a real must to go inside, outside is enough.",
          "Well first thing you notice is the colour, which is rather good and evidently meaningful as ate the statues. You really need a guide to explain all the significance. Inside its like most temples in Vietnam, interesting if you like these type of thing.",
          "A quiet place, even though there were a lot of tourists. hanging from the ceiling incense were interesting. The guide told: if the ash will fall on you, it will bring good luck.",
          "Fantastic little city with loads of attractions, the old town is very very interesting and the night markets are amazing",
          "This one is well documented in terms of it's history. It was part of our tour and found having a guide explain things so useful. It will cost you one of your 5 tickets but makes for a worthy pick.",
          "This temple is right in the middle of town and probably the most photogenic of the temples. I got some great shots. Worth a visit.",
          "There are several historical buildings in the ancient town of Hoi An, It will cost you one of your five entrance tickets,. This one is well documented and presented, It has several sections worthy of viewing, try and get a guide or tag along to another group.",
          "My favorite was the koi fish in the pool! Then the bonsai trees around the courtyard. The shrines were colourful and scented with incense. The horses I didnt understand as I didnt have a guide with me. Worth visiting though.",
          "Best visual attraction in hoi an. Won't take long to visit but beautiful and very cultural. Can visit with ticket",
          "Definitely a photogenic temple. You will be taking lots of pictures of this colorful place. It is both the oldest of its kind and one of the best. You get a feeling of reality walking along steps that have been used for years.",
          "Viewed only from courtyard - looked nice I'm not sure if I qualify to further comment as we just got there without any research, so wasn't sure what I was looking at till I was already there !!",
          "Beautiful colourful temple located in the heart of Hoi An. Dress appropriately. Very photogenic. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Phuc Kien is the oldest of it's kind in Hoi an Ancient Town and in our opinions, the best. Upon entering off the streets, we were attracted to the open, clean beauty that the entrance courtyard presented. From beautiful wall designs and carvings, to the pond statues and",
          "in old town hoi an you will go past this place , worth a visit very pretty Chinese Assembly hall ...",
          "This another beautiful, peaceful place to be. The ornate designs are wonderful to see. Wander around here for a feel of Hoi An",
          "This was one of out favorite stops on the self guided tours in ancients town. You buy tickets from these booths entering the ancient town and are given a map. This much be one of your 5 stops",
          "This is included on the ticket that you buy to cross the bridge so you may as well make use of your ticket the dragons are stunning loved them and it has a lovely peaceful feel when you wander around",
          "As ancient buildings go, especially Chinese, it is pretty \u201crun of the mill\u201d but it is still a beautiful building and very interesting. It is well on the tourist map and is one of the first that people visit on the entrance voucher scheme so it gets very busy. There are three",
          "Very beautiful and colorful Assembly Hall. It needs the entrance ticket to enter and its really worth to visit this place. Originally a traditional assembly hall, this structure was later transformed into a temple for the worship of Thien Hau, a deity from Fujian. So some local",
          "An assembly hall set up by merchants who left China. Lots of beautiful touches in the architectural detail. Clean restroom. Places to sit and rest for a bit.",
          "A rather tranquil place in a town that's not overly crowded with tourists on a Monday morning. There is a temple that is overwhelming with incense and artifacts, beautiful flowers and religious based sculptures. Definitely worth a quick visit.",
          "Not that Hoi An is hectic by any means but this place is a nice place just to step into and just relax and enjoy the beautiful plants. The bonsai trees are really beautiful and there are some interesting statues to look at as well..slip in and relax!!",
          "This is probably the most outstanding building in the Ancient Town. The building was building by the early Chinese settlers from FUZIAN, CHINA; as the name indicates (FUKIAN means FUZIAN in the southern part of China, XIAMEN is the main town, where FUZHOU is the capital).",
          "This assembly hall was relatively easy to find, head where the crowd of tourists are... Unfortunately it was quite busy and it was difficult to take photos and enjoy the hall for its beauty and peace when there were tour guides speaking many languages and tourist everywhere.",
          "We had seen photo of this assembly hall before and it looks even prettier in reality. In fact all the temples of Hoi An are unique and beautiful. Must visit.",
          "Exotic and colorful. Looks refurbished. Nice Chinese calligraphy. Usual garish Chinese altars. Nice cultured plants in the foreground garden area. Overall worth a visit.",
          "dedicated to the goddess of the sea, this is a very flamboyant building in the ancient town of Hoi An. the outside facade is very colourful and beautiful.",
          "Visited while walking around the Hoi An ancient town. The assembly hall is very impressive and has been well preserved considering it was built by the Chinese in the 17th century. The hall grounds also house the Thien Hau temple, which traders used to pray to the goddess of the",
          "Great architecture and culture. There are a lot of things to know about this place, so it's better if you go with a tour guide.",
          "Fukian Assembly Hall is one of the assembly halls in Hoi An which is worth the visit by using one of the 5 coupons in the Hoi An Old Quarter pass. Established by Chinese sea merchants to worship the Thien Hau sea deity in 17th century, there are several statues and paintings",

          "This assembly hall was erected some time in the 1600 by local Fukienese people as a place to socialize. It was later transformed into a temple dedicated to the Goddess of The Sea. This is a very ornate and colourful temple that houses elaborate altars and statues of dieties and",
          "It was good but maybe not so good as I expected. Besides the buildings which were nice, the surroundings are so peaceful. Only if we had some more minutes to rest...",
          "This is the nicest assembly hall in town and provided for many beautiful pictures. Guide was very helpful in getting a full understanding of its uses and history.",
          "After living in Asia for many years, we found most of the old houses, temples, assembly hall disappointing after reading the reviews from others. We have seen far better temples, gardens and pagodas in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand then here, but for a person travelling to Asia",
          "watch out on rainy day if you have flips flops cuz it's slippery! interesting building to see, and colorful",
          "One of the attractions included in your day ticket to Hoi An town. A beautiful Bonsai garden outside and an interesting temple inside. Wander around and take lots of photos!",
          "The building itself was unique and lovely, but my experience here was poor because of the ticket woman. When I first entered I thought my 5-ticket piece of paper was perforated and that I was supposed to rip off a ticket to hand her. Upon touching it, I realized it was just",
          "What makes these places better are the tbrongs and tourist rush.. One doesn't want to skip it out of that dejavu feeling just coz we see hordes entering it ..and I should tooo. Nice ..vibrant..tells a story ..and luckily the place not converted Into a merchandise vending",
          "Lots of interior shrines and the courtyards was especially nice! We thought this was one of the more beautiful of the Assembly Halls.",
          "This temple was the last site we visited in Old Hoi An. As Assembly Houses go this one is certainly the best one in town. One goes through courtyards and gates until arriving at the main temple - no shoes allowed inside. There are various relics throughout including small fish",
          "You enter to a quiet, full of flowering plants space from which you enter another one with stone statues, mosaics on the grounds , many bougainvilas and into the hall with a very impressive green stone table , a big rectangular mosaic looking like a carpet. big bird made of",
          "We visited this attraction as one of five using the Hoi An Attraction Pass. We enjoyed the visit with most interest being stimulated by the art works that were present. The gardens were nicely presented and you felt more welcome than the other places we visited using the",

          "I was really blown away by the architecture here, it is colourful, intricate and very individual. Loved the beautifully mosaic-ed statues. Would definitely recommend a look. You don't need long to look around at all. You can enter by purchasing a ticket to the old town and using",
          "we are not impressed with the outside gate of the temple. but when it goes in, we were surprised by its beauty. A Chinese temple built. It has architectural and beautiful space.",
          "Started from 1697 as a Buddhist temple,upgraded into an assembly hall for Fujian refugees , it's one of the highlights in the old quarter of Hoian which is UNESCO CULTURAL HERITAGE from 1999. The gate which behind the incense burner is the best for photos",
          "Fukian Assembly Hall bears all the fundamental features in structure of a Chinese Assembly Hall. Its ornate gate and colourful courtyard with fountains make the temple very photogenic. The main hall is the biggest room, where lies a shrine and many delicate-carved dragons.",
          "Hoi An was once a melting pot that including Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Europeans. As the Chinese began to settle in Hoi An and other parts of Vietnam, they decided to create opportunities for themselves and the next generations to socialize and protect the Chinese",
          "As a Chinese, I can feel the history of early settlers from Fujian province ooze into life here! You'd need a ticket (sold outside the place with 5 stubs for 5 attractions), though.",
          "One of the sites you can see as part of the 120,000 dong ticket, this is a beautiful, historic and relaxing temple site. No souvenirs!",

          "It's worth checking it out for the Fukian style furnishings with a Temple inside. It seems to be still active as the time we went, they were collecting supplies for an upcoming festival.",
          "Amazing landmark with history date back to the ancient China influenced era! It is worth a visit to admire its beautiful architecture, and to see how much China influences had influxed to this ancient port town.",
          "Pretty enough attraction to view for five to ten minutes if you're already planning to be in the area.",
          "This is probably the assembly hall worth visiting in Hoi An with one of your tickets. It is the largest hall compared to the others. It was originally a pagoda built by the Vietnamese but later the rich traders of the Phuoc Kien dialect came to Hoi An and rebuilt it and name",
          "Also known as Phuc Kien Assembly Hall, it was originally built by the Chinese Hokkien community in Hoi An to accommodate the traders from Fujian, China whenever they needed a place to meet, socialize or even do business. Years later it was turned into a temple for the Goddess",
          "Well worth a visit if in Hoi An. Great sense of history and fantastic surroundings. Very quite and relaxing in what can be a hectic Hoi An.",
          "Without much to explain what the hall was about the significance of the building wasn't understood by our family. There was a wooden sign to explain what the hall was used for in previous times but nothing else. Lovely to look at and a nice fountain inside.",
          "If you buy a ticket to the old town, you should no doubt visit here - it is probably the most impressive place in Hoi An.",
          "The entrance gate is very elegant. There were many large coils of incense burning in the main hall. Also impressive were the pictures hanging on the walls. Saw many Vietnamese visitors praying to deity Thien Hau, placed at the altar in the main hall.",

          "This little place is a peaceful retreat from the bustle of the Old Town. There are may plants in the courtyard and the trees shade you from the afternoon sun. Inside the hall itself there are many pieces of art to look at, but its the colour of the building itself and the",
          "This pink 'temple' is a nice oasis in the old town. Definitely worth a short visit. Love the building.",
          "Attractive for it's style - and you either love these or you don't! - being very ornate, and over-the-top decorative. But it has a slightly mystical/mythical quality that sets it apart from the other local architecture, enhanced by the tranquillity of the courtyard and grounds.",
          "One of a number of fascinating place to see, go early or late to avoid the possibility of a bus trip. Ticket required, easily obtained in block of 5 from various points around the city. I loved the history of this place, the serenity, and the complexity of the decorative art",
          "It doesn't take long to visit the 17th Century temple that functioned as an assembly hall. It's probably better with a guide to explain the sculptures and paintings but if not, still worth the short visit while out walking the historic streets of Hoi An.",
          "Worth stopping on for 15 minutes when walking around the town. Very bright and colourful and relatively peaceful. Interesting architecture.",
          "Make this part of a simple walking tour of the ancient town as it's well worth a 15-20 minute stop. It is interesting to compare the different halls, houses and temple to see the different different inluences.",

          "Built by Chinese merchants who emigrated from Fujian Province after the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644, this fanciful building is remarkably ornate. Gateways lead to outer courtyard, and then another gateway leads to an inner courtyard with beautiful Bonsai trees, and then to",

          "I think this is the nicest building here. Very colorful and well maintained. There are lots of flowers and plants to cheer up the place.",
          "This is a well kept Assembly Hall and it seems that it is still in use. There is a plaque that tells some of the history of the building. It took us about 10 minutes to walk round and though interesting it is fairly small.",
          "This assembly hall originally catered for the Chinese of Fukian origin and there are others for Cantonese and Hainan that are remarkably similar to the untrained western eye. Not a list topping sight but worthy of inclusion in the list of 5 that you get with the Old Town ticket.",
          "Hoi An is so small that it is very easy to do all the attractions in a day or two depending on your speed. This is another main attraction and it is also very nice. Architecture is stunning and there are many places to take a lasting memory. Free during Tet! Everyone was at the",
          "I stumbled across this building by accident & decided to visit although it was not on my list. I am so pleased I did as it is well worth a visit. I was particularly impressed with the large incense spirals as I have not seen them before outside of Hoi An. Visited during Tet so",
          "There were so few people here as to almost seem it had been forgotten! But it is well worth a wander away from the main drag to come and see this place. Beautiful atmosphere, stunning photos to be taken and generally worth a visit",
          "It isn't surprising that Trip Advisor uses a picture of this as their main cover picture for Hoi An. It is very photogenic and they allow photography. Write your wishes on a card and buy one of the large incense spirals for $20. The courtyard also has a box for donations for",
          "Hoi an is a busy place, the Assembly Hall (Phuc Kien) is a little corner of calm. The hall is dedicated to the goddess of the sea, Thien Hau and was established as a meeting place by Chinese merchants fleeing the Manchu conquest of China .Lots of incense coils . You are sure",
          "Another of the recommended places to visit using your book of tourist tickets- glad that the money raised helps towards preserving the historic sights in the ancient town of Hoi An. Must be one of the most photographed places and one of the most visited, as we had to queue and",
          "An interesting building and 'gardens', there see lots of the ornamentation that is to be expected in Chinese buildings, ornate plaster work, carvings, mouldings and mythical characters. The 'gardens, had lots of bonsai's plants and miniature landscapes. Typical 'rooms' leading",
          "In a town as busy as Hoi An this turned out to be a welcome surprise. It is spacious and boasts some amazing architecture, ceramics, bonsai and murals. The smell of incense fills the air and there is a nice feeling of calm.",
          "Visited this on a walking trip of old Hoi An with our Exodus guide. An Assembly Hall for one of the large group of Chinese with the same name. A riot of colour and statuary from the entrance to the altars. Lovely small garden in front. Busy with tourists visiting the same",
          "Amazing murals inside in plaster. A good temple and nice respite from busy narrow streets of Hoi An. Look out for the 12 midwives who teach children how to smile and feed etc in the first year of their lives.",

          "After we finished visiting Tan Ky House, we walked through town to our next attraction \u2013 the Fukian Assembly Hall. The first thing I noticed about the hall is the interesting roof line at the first entrance. There are interesting animal figurines on them including a dragon,",

          "Located on Tran Phu and close to the market the Fukien Assembly Room is a meeting and blessing location built by the Fukien Chinese in the 17th century. It's a real delightful small historic site which gets you away from the fairly busy streets of the old town and takes you back",
          "The Assemble Hall is located at Phuc Kien Hoi Quan & admission is by using the Old Town tourist ticket. If wanting to escape the heat then visiting this hall is definitely worth some time. The Assemble Hall was build for the Chinese people who came from Fujian in China. It was",

          "Your multi site Hoi An ticket lets you visit one Assembly Hall. I visited late afternoon, after I had already been to the Cantonese Assembly Hall - but I managed to get in here with no one checking my ticket. It is worth seeing if you can get into a few additional places even if",

          "Colourful, flamboyant, ornate - this is quite a building! Dedicated to the Goddess of the Sea she is attended by her assistants - her eyes and ears - who alert her to those in danger on the sea. A model of a sailing junk is to the right f the altar. The incense can be rather",

          "This house was rather interesting (more than the previous one) however I am not so sure about the strength of the place in itself and I think that the house will look more interesting if they remove the \u201ccorner shops\u201d and furnish the house completely (however I do understand",
          "This house can be visited on the ticket for attractions in Hoi An Old Town or Ancient Town. The decorations and furniture in the home are interesting and I enjoyed seeing a slice of life currently and in the past. I think stopping in some of the old houses that you can visit",

          "Interesting old house in Hoi An. Nothing startling about the architecture or layout but the history of the house is very interesting and the generations of family that still live there. Well worth your time if you are in the vicinity.",
          "Visited this old house as it\u2019s just before the Japanese bridge and is noted for its traditional architecture and for showing the interior still with its original furniture. Whilst it\u2019s a nice building, you are met at door by a guide who says it\u2019s part of her family (which by all",
          "You will find this 100yrs+ old house just after crossing Japanese Bridge. The house still have the original antique furnitures. This two storied wooden house should not take more than 10 mins to cover. This house is an example of asian architecture of that point of time. Btw it",
          "I love history and that is why I visited Hoi An, but there was very little of that in this house. You are greeted by unwelcoming, rude staff and once inside, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s just been turned into a market. You can see almost nothing with all of the blankets and tourist crap",
          "Yes it\u2019s a beautiful house but, this is how it goes, met by a beautiful girl who says it\u2019s her family home then recites a scripted (?) piece about the history. Any extra questions go unanswered. Then you are led to a back room where members of the family are embroidering silk,",
          "This is another on the list of places to see in Hoi-An, and whilst they all seem to be similar they do all have their own character, and are beautifully presented.",

          "Very interesting to go into one of the old houses to see how people lived previously. It would have been better if there was an explanation given of the different areas. A section of the house is currently used as a shop to display art as well as the beautiful craft of",
          "The old house Phung Hung is one of the most famous architectural buildings in Hoi An built in 1780. The original family still lives there. It shows what life was like back in the 18th century.",
          "The house is gorgeously maintained and has lovely furniture and artifacts to show what it was like to live there. It would be great to have a little more English interpretation",
          "This really is an extraordinary opportunity to glimpse the past way of life in this beautiful house, the many items of furniture and ornamentation really serve to present the living conditions of a wealthy merchant at that time.",
          "The old house museums of Hoi An really aren\u2019t much to write home about. This one follows the standard format: a formal living area at the front giving way to a souvenir shop at the back. This shop specialised in hand made embroidery of the kind your half blind grandma could",
          "This typical old structure has an inside open courtyard. You see pictures of former occupants that date back generations, plus the usual alter to the ancestors. One of many historic structures.",
          "The Phun Hung old house is interesting to the people who actually bother to listen to the staff briefing. The house is a over 200 years old and has 80 columns on Marble bases. The house floods every year up to about 1.2 to 1.5 metres and as such, they have a trap door on the 2nd",
          "Interesting how the Chinese kept the air flowing in their house in An Hoi. Go to the second floor and admire. There are also beautiful old Chinese furniture on the first floor.",
          "Old must be relative as 250 years is barely run in. Sure it\u2019s a living symbol of home style but again has a spending opportunity waiting around ever corner. The embroidery was exquisite and the lady working certainly one if the few artisans.",
          "Located right next to the Japanese Bridge, you'd think that this place would have been awesome. It's the only two-level house you can visit. But, the staff was so disinterested they were actually sleeping! They did, however, wake up when someone wanted to buy an overpriced",
          "Good selection of old Vietnamese furniture and insight into how dark and small rooms. No lights and just lantern.",
          "A cracking 2 storey house built in 1780 at a time when Hoi An was prospering. Lots of Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese influence in the architecture. Well worth a wonder round if in the area.",
          "This house is one of the Nice must see houses of the city, the second Floor of the house is full of old stuff.i mostly like the balcony of the second floor which you can see the street and people. it was a good idea to have a not a long stop there",
          "This is the only old house I visited where you can ascend to the second floor. It is a mixture of Japanese and Chinese architecture. There are a couple of souvenir stalls in the house. The house has a view of the entrance to the Japanese bridge from the second floor. There are",
          "I felt so privledged to be there - history seeping through the walls. A must see when you visit Hoi An. We didn't buy any souvenir but nor did we feel pressured or obliged.",

          "Imagine, approaching 250 years old and using engineering intelligence, the entire house can be dismantled in a couple of hours. They made one beam a key beam and with it in place, the entire house is held together. Move that key beam and all the other beams can be taken down",

          "We visited this house and had one of the family members tell us the history of it. They have a few items for sale but more expensive than the shops in Hanoi. We did buy some lacquer ware which because we had gone back three times to look at it the head of the family gave us a",

          "You can visit this house on the same low price ticket used to fross the Japanese Bridge. Is it worth your time though. Well, yes the house is but the blatant sales pitch to buy souvenirs is a real turn off, especially as many of the souvenirs are available cheaper in other shops",
          "Unlike many other old houses, one gets to see a lot more here. Interesting old furniture, statues, crockery and cutlery. You get to buy some mementos and art pieces here at reasonable prices.",
          "OK, the good things about this house are that it's beautiful inside and out and you can go up to the second floor and look down upon the street. Having said that, there are many such places in Hoi An you see beautiful interiors and hit the second level without wasting a ticket -",
          "The house by itself is nice but actually they just try to sell you their stuff. Unpleasant presentation of the house Really disappointing",
          "Thoroughly disappointing. A beautiful old house that presents itself as a museum but is actually a shop. You have to give one of your 5 tickets to get in to have a cursory tour that is basically solely focused on trying to sell you stuff. Frustrating. The owners have no idea",
          "Beautifully built and unique but sadly poorly maintained. It\u2019s dusty and there were lots of cobwebs everywhere. No written information at all on this building, staff selling embroidery couldn\u2019t speak English & were not very friendly.",
          "The old house of Phun Hung is another one of the places you can visit with the Heritage Visit package. It used to be the house of a rich family and you can see how they lived. A friendly guide will give you explanations about the house and its uses.",
          "Another of the preserved ancient houses of Hoi An. Each has interesting architecture and old furnishings and has a historic story to tell. Nicely preserved.",
          "Worth visiting for the architecture alone, but with little written information anywhere, we followed a group of tourists with an English-speaking guide which was much better! Fantastic carpenter's craftsmanship all around, although very dark inside (but we did visit on a cloudy",
          "Understand all the old house style of years ago. Hand made with a lot of time pay out...but really beautiful!",
          "It's the history of the house as much as the house itself that means it's worth a quick walk through. This is a tourist business so don't expect a profound discussion but some of the building styles and the layout has a certain interest. Some nice woodwork and inlays and a",
          "No information, nothing really to look at other than the stuff being sold. It might as well just be a shop and not agood one at that.",
          "Boring house full of tourist souvenirs! I expect some explanation in English without trying to sell stuff!",
          "This ancient house is one of the top attractions in Hoi An. Hoi An generally is so lovable old town, so is this house. Very well preserved and unique interior. Go upstairs to the balcony from which you would see Hoi An like never before.",
          "We spent about 15-20mins looking at this ancient home. We were offered a free english speaking guide which we accepted, but we turned down the free tea. Very old building that gives you an insight into how people lived in the city.",
          "Entry was covered by our Old Town ticket which gave us access to 5 sights in the old town. We didn't stop for the free tea so the entire guided visit took about 15-20mins.",
          "Great house to look , it is really interesting and a great example of how Vietnamese lived, still occupied with distant relatives of the house",
          "House which has had 200 years of history and 7 generations living on the premises still today, some of the furniture is extraordinarily beautiful done in mahogany and mother of pearl. Yes they will sell you a coin for the year you were born but for a $1 and a souvenir of your",
          "First, it's a good example of how well-to-do Vietnamese used to live in the old days, and is still occupied by descendants of the original owning family of 200 years ago. Second, they have a side-line cottage industry in which they make and sell beautifully embroidered",
          "A quaint house still occupied today. Nice to visit but be careful as they do try and sell you their merchandise the whole time you're there",
          "This was the first of the 'attractions' we saw in Hoi An with our Old Town pass. You have to buy the pass to enter the Old Town and then you can visit 5 attractions with the pass. I felt that this was worth using a ticket on as it was all family-run and the original family",
          "You have to pay to get in and to be honest not worth it. On the main street in the old town. Be carefull of the many scooters",
          "This house is full of beauty, steeped in history, and very charming. However, we were followed constantly by staff, which rather took the edge off what should have been a pleasant experience. Clearly thought we were going to lift a 6 foot dresser on the way out!",
          "You need one of your five tickets from your ancient town sighseeing pass to visit this ancient family home. This merchants house has been in family ownership for eight generations and is constructed of 80 columns of ironwood on marble pedestals.",
          "This is a nice way to see how the well off locals lived 100 years ago. Nice rooms, good view but very touristic and commercial.",
          "One of the must see houses in Hoian together with the Japanese bridge and the main temples (community halls). This one is quite large and from its balcony you can get a nice view of the Japanese bridge.",
          "historical home that showed how people lived in the 16th century. people still occupy it at present this aspect takes you back in time",
          "It was a good peak into how houses 100 years ago looked. Was interesting to walk through the house, and see the Chinese Vietnamese and Japanese influences on the structure of the house. The \"tour\" is given by members of descendant family of the original home owners. It's a tad",
          "Not suitable for anyone with mobility issues. Interesting to see the old ways of living, so much simpler. Kids were bored with it...too much history for one day. A nice place to contemplate life and surprisingly cool out of the midday swelter. Gives you a better understanding",
          "A nice buiding near the Japanese bridge. A good place to check out to add to your Hoi An experiance. Good for a photo opp.",
          "Nice little house. You get to see how they lived before the war. This is passed down thru the generations. The elderly couple who live there were working the door. They were very sweet. It is very small but interesting.",
          "To walk in a house that is over 200 years old and still standing begs the training and aprenticeships of craftsmen builders. This home is a combination of chinese , japanese and vietnamese builders.The steps to the first floor are still sturdy and the girl assured us that it was",
          "Another must see attraction in hai au. You get to see how a family lived before the Vietnamese war. Lots of interesting items to look at.",
          "This a lovely old house made out of some beautifully designed and crafted wood. Most if this house has been turned into a gift shop. I did get myself a beautifully hand stitched picture here.",
          "It was nice to see an old house well preserved. However, the sales push for embroidered fabrics was a bit over the top for me. Nice street views from the balcony.",
          "This beautiful old house was built in 1780 and is a national historical and cultural site in Hoi An. It is mainly wooden, two-storied, and combines Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese architecture. It has 80 wooden columns resting on a lotus-shaped base.",
          "By the time I got around to visiting this place I'd already used up all my tickets and had seen a selection of other traditional houses. As such, I was content to take a quick peek through the entrance at this one which didn't seem to be significantly different than the others.",
          "The huse is old and the structure itself is as it used to be. It is interesting to know how people lived in old days.",
          "After reading the reviews here which ranged from historical gem to touristic we went to this house as part of our ticket to Old Hoi An. There was some family history and some parts of the house are interesting to look at, but it really was at least 60% filled with objects for",
          "Not only is this an authentic old house, an historic gem, but it is the best place to buy embroidered tablecloths. The family members are all involved in the various crafts on show (and even claim to still live on the premises) Close to the Japanese Bridge - don't miss it",
          "All the old houses in Hoi An are interesting but also very touristic and in the back have shops. This is how they get at your wallet! Hoi An is pretty but 2 days, including MySon (a must excursion) is enough.",
          "Another of the old houses presenting a slice of life back in history. You can visit 5 places on your Hoi An ticket and this should be on your list.",
          "This was probably the best of the houses in the Ancient town. Well maintained and still used. Had a quick tour and the chance to purchase items which we declined.",
          "Nice to see this house still in use. We toured the house but noticed that they use it primarily to see wares particularly table cloths and napkins.",
          "This is a great example of a historical house that is still inhabited by a family. They have items to buy in the house including traditional items that they still make by hand. It is interesting to view the layout of the house and the different rooms and spaces plus admire the",
          "It is highly likely that you won't enjoy a visit to this old house. When you walk in the door you are taken on a tour. After a couple of sentences about the house you are taken around and shown things which you can buy such as embroidery and clothes. It is pushed on you by the",
          "In it self not a lot see just loads of cheap souvenirs for sale. This one you can skip when you're in town..",
          "Ancient quayside boarding house / bordello that catered to all the needs of the various foreign trades of the Middle-Ages. Like something from the American Wild West during the prospecting gold rush era.",
          "This house allows you to see into the way of life in the past. Great architectural detail and has been well maintained. A little too much sales with goods to purchase.",
          "Nice to see the house nicely cared for. Good to see the history in the house and town. Alot of dark wood used back in the olden days. fyi. The doors leading to the outside porch is very slim. So someone with wide shoulders has to turn sideways. Sorry no pics. It's in my",
          "I loved this, being able to be in the house observing true Vietnamese way of life. The embroidery items for sale show so much detail and all hand done.",
          "Stumbled across this ancient house ,but enjoyed the history lesson from a young girl ,who showed us through the house.",
          "Even though it is not beautiful. It is a sample of ancient houses. People still live there but the first floor is devoted to tourists. The red color is predominant inside and gives a strong taste. I cannot imagine people living there. It was good to know ancient places like this",
          "Upon walking in (after paying to enter), we were greeted with a couple of happy tour guides, where we were then asked to sit and listen to a quick briefing on the houses history. Walking through the house we were constantly lead to things to buy that wasn't really necessary. A",
          "This is a typical old house from the area. It has a marks up the wall where it has been flooded many times. Owned by the same family for many generations. You are given a guided tour and explained all history of the house . Also given green tea as a welcome drink.",
          "Again a ticket enter but interesting stop off. The house had been in one family for 6 generations and you can see the flooding over the years...",
          "It was great to be able to visit an old house. It is still lived in and has been well looked after. Guides took you round and offered a choice of English or French speaking guides. The visit was great but the slight down side was that they did try very hard to make us buy table",
          "Quaint old house with lots of interest. Interesting meeting the people who owned the house and talking to them",
          "Very interesting and informative. Would recommend to visit this historical building on your visit to Hoi An",
          "Guided tours of the Old Houses all seem to follow the same script and often there is too much retail as part of the 'experience'",
          "this is an old house and this was how the houses were during that time. Inside you will still some old items and furniture. it gives you an insight of how hoi an was. a nice place to visit if you like old houses.",
          "Always wanted to know how people lived in the old days? Visit this place and be amazed! I loved it s\u00f3 much!",
          "It was fascinating to see what family life was like in bygone years. It certainly was communal living. The wooden beams and carvings were beautiful.",
          "i don't even know why is it a tourist attraction as it is just an old house with nothing special to see. Well unless you are totally unfamiliar with old Chinese architecture, I will advise you to skip this place and not to waste your ticket here.",
          "If you have only some limited time and wish to visit only one house; then do visit this old house of Phun Hung. The old house is easy to find as it is next to the well known bridge. I found the visit interesting as it transported us back to decades ago of history. It amazed me",
          "We had visited 3 old houses in Hue. This was one of them together with Duc An old house and Tan Ky old house. We think that Phun Hung old house is the best of the 3. It allowed access throughout the house including the second floor and the balcony. The architecture is really",
          "Another clip on the Hoi An Old Town Pass. The history was interesting but every room has someone trying to sell you something. The ladies are very informative as it is their family home they are letting you into.",

          "Got guided around this old house by a daughter of the family who still live here. Amazing to think that the house floods every few years when the river rises, but ironwood beams can handle it. Served little cups of green tea upstairs and can look into the street from balcony and",

          "Visited as part of a walking tour through the old town. Interesting architecture being a mixture of Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese. Guides were very informative and gave a full history of the house. Well worth the visit even though it was quite crowded inside.",
          "it was interesting to see this very old house that has belonged to the same family for many generations. I was a little disappointed by the push to purchase embroidered cloths once we got inside though.",
          "Charming old house situated close to the Japanese Bridge. Built over 200 years ago it is still lived in by the eighth generation of the same family. It is constructed of 80 columns of Ironwood on marble pedestals. During the floods of 1964 it became home to 160 locals for 3 days",
          "Interesting to see an old house but rather spoilt by them using it as an opportunity to sell you some \"local handicrafts\"",
          "The fascinating thing with this house (like most of the historic homes in Hoi An) is that it is still lived in. I was given a guided tour (as part of a group) by a member of the family which started with a talk in the front room - giving us interesting information about the",

          "The guided tour was interesting and although there were items for sale there was no hard sell of them. This a larger ancient house and gave a slightly different view of life. Upstairs is accesible and there is a good view from the balcony.",
          "Everybody should visit this old house,maintained in pristine condition. The architecture,outside ans especially inside,is a good example of how wealthy families lived in Hoi An.",
          "This is a large Ancient House and we got a guided tour, yes a bit rushed but at least we got one unlike at Tan Ky. You can go upstairs in this house and onto the balcony overlooking the street. A girl was doing embroidery on a loom downstairs and you could buy her work",
          "A bit brusque attitude of family members here compared to some of the old house visits I attended, but all were well worth visiting. Especially the kitchen set ups,",
          "For a building built in 1780 it is in remarkable condition... The woodwork is quite beautiful. This was part of our day tour...so it felt somewhat rushed... and of course , exceptionally crowded. There was a time when this was a shop trading in cinnamon, pepper, salt, silk,",
          "This old house contains some useful local history and is set out in a traditional style of a traders house although in reality not quite as old as it looked but worth a visit.",

          "See how they lived - the houses are really ancient and how they have managed to survive with the perpetual flooding, God only knows. There are loads of old houses to visit - some you have to pay for and some house shops/restaurants so take your pick!",
          "Seeing the way people lived and still live in old great homes was interesting. There is a lot of handy crafts and art to look at and buy with good prices. Hand made embroidered things. IF you see something you like, buy it as you may not see if again!",
          "An old house with influences of 3 architectures .Japanese n Chinese and Vietnamese . We are always offered green tea which is rather nice way of being hospitable . One thing that spoils it is that these guys don't spare any visiting place devoid of souvenir selling and",
          "To be fair the house is lovely. However as others have said despite one spending a ticket to get in the information provided by the \"members of the family\" depends on how much you spend in the house. They push the cotton table cloths really hard almost making one feel guilty for",
          "An amazing old house. No surprise that as soon as you step inside the focus is on the wares for sale. We bought $10USD worth of quality goods and was happy to do so. Unless tourists support these businesses then it will all turn to Starbucks or McDonalds. Thank goodness they",
          "The house has been built in1748 and seven generation have already lived there. The main pillars stand on marble stands . The beams are incrdeible and they have a small back terrace",
          "We visited this attraction as one of five using the Hoi An Attraction Pass. The house is located near the Japanese Covered Bridge. The welcome was pleasant and we were quickly ushered into where they were carrying out embroidery. We were given a thorough run down of how long",
          "We were welcomed by a guide who claimed to be a seventh generation of the original family but who knew surprisingly little about the family, the building and the history in general. Such a shame as there must be a lot to tell about this family home. We liked the fact that you",
          "Stopped in at this house on our guided tour. Lovely embroidery, tablecloths,napkins,runners etc. Enjoyed the story of the family.",
          "Nice building style, great house, but they are a bit to keen to sell you souvenirs. I does have a nice atmosphere if you look past the shop......",
          "This ancient house is just a few doors down from the Japanese Covered Bridge and is well worth a visit to learn a little of the history of Hoi An. When we visited we were shown through by a woman who is eighth generation of the original family. The place is very dark with dark",
          "Just after the Japanese bridge in Hoi An. You can use part of your ticket into the Old Town to gain entry into here. Very interesting and lovely courtyard.",
          "Located about 20m from the western exit of the Japanese Covered Bridge, this is a grand old building. I wandered in and was offered a guided tour by one of the employees of the present owner. Apparently, the present occupant is an 8th generation decedent of the original owner.",
          "we visited the house last year but this time even more interesting - you can see more datils, more specific things. We weren't met by His grandson, but anyway we read old docs, saw his life more, asked about the building and so on. we came exactly before the closing time and",
          "Located right after the Japanese covered bridge, this was the first old house that I visited. There are always guides in the house to explain the history of the house to you. It felt like visiting some granduncles or grandaunts as you step inside the house, you can actually",
          "As part of your ticket into the old town this is one of the buildings you can visit. It is an architechtural marvel, and well worth the visit if you're into architechture and history. You will likely walk past it a few times when you're walking around Hoi An!",
          "We preferred this old house to the Tan Ky example. It was better to be able to visit the upper level and gain a full perspective of the building. I feel the value of the old houses is helping visitors to gain a better feel for the historical tapestry of Ho An rather any",
          "A well maintained house showing the style of the times. Lovely courtyard. Well maintained and gives a good impression of how the houses used to be like.",
          "This is both a museum and a family dwelling. A member of the family will show you around the residence explaining various aspects of their home and lifestyle now and in by gone times. The family produce hand embroidered table clothes which are for sale on the lower floor.",
          "House is very nice with great history.Once in you are handed over to one of the \"family\" who brings you through the house - telling the 7 generation history and trying at every turn to sell you something. Basically this historic building is a tourist shop with a cover charge.",
          "When you cross the Japanese Covered Bridge and come out this house is on the right. It is one of the old houses you can visit in Hoi An and unlike Tan Ky you can go to the upper level. Nice view out to the street from the upper level too. We used our tickets to visit this",
          "Like the other old houses open to the public in Hoi An, the house of Phung Hung is also a shop selling table cloths etc. They weren't the sort of thing I wanted to buy and once a I had made that clear the sales girls let me wander around without bothering me. There's plenty to",
          "Again one of the narrow houses which goes back a long way. This is due to the price of frontage and also good luck. Again see how high the river floods especially at houses near the water.",
          "If you like old houses , and you want to feel history this is a very charming place . A bit rickety but that is part of the charm . Look closely at the walls, the architecture to truely appreciate the skills of carpenters long ago",
          "Amazing little house where the famous merchant lived; enfront, his business, then the courtyard with the well where all their water was kept, and in the back, where the family lived. Beautiful black and engraved furniture, lamps, and many Vietnamese porcelain artifacts..",
          "I am really into architecture, especially the ancient houses, Phung Hung house was all made from wood and it was affected by Japanese, Chinese architecture but with a Vietnamese style. However, there are not much to see, so my recommention is to stay there for 10-15min is",
          "Right next to the Japanese Bridge is the Old House of Phun Hung. It was the second old house we visited and found it very similar in design to the Old House of Tan Ky with a mix of Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese architectural influences. There were some lovely decorative",
          "This house is just across the Japanese Bridge. I found the visit here more worthy than Tan Ky House. Its upstairs rooms can be accessed. The English guide here is knowledgeable, friendly and good, when asked why this house was chosen for display among so many old houses she",

          "Visited the Old House of Phun Hung on our arrival to Hoi An ancient town. The heavens had open so we sought refuge along with many others. It was very busy inside and you needed to listen carefully to her the history. Loved the high ceilings.",
          "After entering you get a guided tour through the house. Could be very interesting, because the house defintely has historic value, but the part where you are invited to buy the hand craft should be left out! Not very friendly guide (we did not buy anything?) but still we saw a",
          "Very nice tea and orientation tour given once you are inside. This house is still being used by the family and the pictures on the wall are very interesting to view which shows the flooding that took place many times which the family has to move everything to the 2nd floor of",
          "Very interesting to visit this old family home. Family member to explain and show you around. Great view and interesting history associated with house. Worth the visit.",
          "Welcomed with tea and given a very interesting tour by a member of the family who spoke excellent English",
          "I visited two of the old houses in Hoi An and Phun Hung seemed to me more intersting than Tan Ky, probably because it's bigger. Anyway both of them are quite intersting",
          "This lovely old house has family still in residence and once inside our tour guide leaves us with a family member to show us around, it is quite dark inside due to the dark wood used Throughout, we were shown on the second floor the opening in the floor where they are able to",

          "Delightful, but I couldn't understand some of the description given by the Vietnamese girl presenter. So what! - it is ancient, historic, dark wood panelled, and full of atmosphere. You could do it in 10 minutes, or stay half an hour or more. You should not miss calling in here.",
          "A guide from the family that has owned the house for 8 generations gave us a brief bit of info (the house is old, some is Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese style, and they go upstairs when it floods) about the place and a lot of pressure to buy the hand crafts upstairs.",

          "Lovely old house, in the typical old style of Hoi An. Lots of charm with little indoor courtyard and beautiful dark wood interior with intricate carvings. I think it would be hard to find this type of architecture anywhere elsel. Quite unique.",
          "A 300 year old wooden house. Regularly flooded but the wood survives these floods. Interesting architecture and design. Same family of traders have lived here for generations. They see your visit as a selling opportunity for various embroidery'd goods and lacquer ware. So",
          "A nice, well preserved old house in The Old Quarter of Hoi An. Not so inpressive as other old houses there, but still worth a few minutes visit while walking the city.",
          "It is located near the Japanese Bridge. You should take a short tour if you buy a ticket. The house is old and there is something for you to get and buy there. Staff is active and happy to provide you what you need. Good place to see!",
          "Well-preservation, friendly staff, nice artchitecture that all we though about Phung Hung. Looked like serveral places in Hoian, they also sell a lot of things inside. However, they greeted and invite us very respectfully. We did not fell any inconvenience. Explore Hoian Town,",
          "This is really a beautiful shop with assistants telling you about the architecture in the spare moments between telling you what is for sale.",
          "Well-preservation, good location, very convenient because located near the Japanese Bridge. The staff was friendly, helpful and had a good knowledge of where they're working for. They could speak English and French. The goods sell in the house was a little bit expensive but ok",
          "Tour was short and we were basically being pressured into buying things, the guide talked as if she was just reading from a script and gave no engagement. Overall the building was lovely and nice to see that it's still in its original condition",

          "This was the first stop I made at one of the historical houses. We were given a tour with only the smallest amount of effort put in to selling souvenirs. Really, she didn't pressure us at all and it was just some beautifully hand-embroidered table linens as opposed to more",

          "You need to cross the Japanese Covered Bridge in order to reach the Old House of Phung Hung. Of all the old houses in Hoi An Old Town this is my favorite. You need to present the entrance ticket as you enter. There are lots of tourists coming here so the place gets too",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "The L\u00ea dynasty, also known as  Later L\u00ea dynasty (Vietnamese: nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00ea \u5bb6\u5f8c\u9ece or H\u1eadu L\u00ea tri\u1ec1u \u5f8c\u9ece\u671d), was the longest-ruling Vietnamese dynasty, ruling from 1428 to 1789 with a brief six-year interruption by the M\u1ea1c dynasty (1527\u20131533). It is usually divided into two historical periods \u2013 the Early L\u00ea dynasty (1428\u20131527) in which emperors ruled in their own right, and the Restored L\u00ea dynasty (1533\u20131789), in which figurehead emperors reigned under the auspices of the powerful Tr\u1ecbnh family. During their reign, Vietnam's economy quickly recovered, grew and became the third-largest economy power in Eastern Asia.The dynasty officially began in 1428 with the enthronement of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i after he drove the Ming army from Vietnam.  The dynasty reached its peak during the reign of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng and declined after his death in 1497. In 1527, the M\u1ea1c dynasty usurped the throne; when the L\u00ea dynasty was restored in 1533, the M\u1ea1c fled to the far north and continued to claim the throne during the period known as Southern and Northern Dynasties. The restored L\u00ea emperors held no real power, and by the time the M\u1ea1c dynasty was finally eradicated in 1677, actual power lay in the hands of the Tr\u1ecbnh lords in the North and Nguy\u1ec5n lords in the South, both ruling in the name of the L\u00ea emperor while fighting each other. The L\u00ea dynasty officially ended in 1789, when the peasant uprising of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers defeated both the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n, ironically in order to restore power to the L\u00ea dynasty.\nThe L\u00ea dynasty expanded Vietnam's borders through the domination of the Kingdom of Champa and expedition into today Laos and Myanmar, nearly reaching Vietnam's modern borders by the time of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n uprising. It also saw massive changes to Vietnamese society: the previously Buddhist state became Confucian after the preceding 20 years of Ming rule. The L\u00ea emperors instituted many changes modeled after the Chinese system, including the civil service and laws. Their long-lasting rule was attributed to the popularity of the early emperors. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's liberation of the country from 20 years of Ming rule and L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's bringing the country into a golden age was well-remembered by the people. Even though the restored L\u00ea emperors' rule was marked by civil strife and constant peasant uprisings, few dared to openly challenge their power for fear of losing popular support. The L\u00ea dynasty also was the period Vietnam saw the coming of Western Europeans and Christianity in early 16th-century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Lam S\u01a1n uprising (1418\u20131427) ===\n\nDuring the Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i led an uprising against the rule of the Ming dynasty in 1418, after two earlier rebellions of two Vietnamese princes Tr\u1ea7n Ng\u1ed7i and Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u00fd Kho\u00e1ng in 1409 and 1413, respectively, were crushed by the Ming military. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was a member of the L\u00ea (\u9ece) clan from Thanh Ho\u00e1, whose mixed Chinese-Vietnamese origins include the Han Chinese governor of Jiuzhen, L\u00ea Ng\u1ecdc \u9ece\u7389 (535\u2013618), who had led a failed rebellion against the Tang Empire in 618 CE.. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was a son of wealthy Vietnamese aristocrat in Thanh Ho\u00e1. He early life was briefly mentioned in the Chinese source as a low-rank official serving the Ming governor Hoang Fu. He joined a secret Taoist swearing commentary in L\u0169ng Nhai, Thanh Ho\u00e1 in winter 1916, with other 18 men, all swore will fought against the Ming Chinese, restore the Vietnamese independence and sovereignty.The Lam S\u01a1n (\"blue mountain\") campaign began on the day after T\u1ebft (Lunar New Year) in February 1418. In November 1424, the Lam S\u01a1n captured the Ngh\u1ec7 An citadel in a surprise attack from their base in Laos, leading to the retreat of the ethnic-Vietnamese Ming commander L\u01b0\u01a1ng Nh\u1eef H\u1ed1t (Liang Juihu) to the north. From their new base in high-density population Ngh\u1ec7 An, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's rebel forces captured the territory in modern-day central Vietnam, from Thanh Ho\u00e1 to \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. By August 1426, the Lam S\u01a1n rebellion launched an offensive to the north with new forces against a fresh Ming army commanded by Wang Tong in charge of defending northern Vietnam. The new Ming ruler, the Xuande Emperor, wished to end the war with Vietnam, but his advisors urged one more effort to subdue the rebellious province. Consequently, the Ming sent a large army of approximately 100,000 men to Vietnam. After the pivotal Battle of T\u1ed1t \u0110\u1ed9ng \u2013 Ch\u00fac \u0110\u1ed9ng in October 1426, the Ming Dynasty withdrew by 1428. By early 1427, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's forces had controlled most of northern Vietnam, advancing as far as the southern tip of modern-day Guangxi. Following negotiations with the Ming, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i selected Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o as a puppet king of Annam who nominally ruled from 1426 to 1428.\n\n\n=== Early rule (1428\u20131527) ===\n\n\n==== L\u00ea L\u1ee3i (1428\u20131433) ====\n\nIn 1428, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i established the L\u00ea dynasty and took the reign name L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5, receiving recognition and formal protection from the Ming dynasty in a tributary relationship.In 1429, he introduced the Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean code, largely based on the Tang Code, with severe charges for gambling, bribery and corruption. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i granted a land reform in 1429 that took lands from people who collaborated with the Chinese and distributed them among landless peasants and soldiers. He distrusted many of his former generals, resulting in the 1430 execution of the two generals Tr\u1ea7n Nguy\u00ean H\u00e3n and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n X\u1ea3o that is considered by Vietnamese historians as a political purge.L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's reign would be short-lived, as he died in 1433.\n\n\n==== L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng (ruled 1433\u20131442) ====\n\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng (\u9ece\u592a\u5b97, ruled 1433\u20131442)  was the official heir to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i. However, he was just eleven, so a close friend of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, L\u00ea S\u00e1t, assumed the regency of the kingdom. Not long after he assumed the official title as Emperor of Vietnam in 1438, L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng accused L\u00ea S\u00e1t of abuse of power and had him executed. In December 1435, Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng ordered general T\u01b0 M\u00e3 T\u00e2y to subdue the T\u00e0y chief C\u1ea7m Qu\u00fd who having a ten-thousand army of raiders in the northwest region. In January 1436, the emperor ordered to make roads and canals from northwest region to the capital for showing the superior power of the Imperial court to the local tribes men. From 1437 to 1441, tribe men from Ai-Lao crossed the Annamite Range, raided in Thanh H\u00f3a and southern H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a (now S\u01a1n La province) with the help of the local raiders led by Nghi\u1ec5m Sinh T\u01b0\u1ee3ng were suppressed by the Imperial army. The L\u00ea Dynasty started treating hostilely to the ethnic minorities in western region. On a stone monument that was carved in 1439 under Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng's reign said \"B\u1ed3n-Man (Muang Phuan) barbarians were against our assimilation, they need to be exterminated to their roots, and with the S\u01a1n-Man (M\u01b0\u1eddng and Ch\u1ee9t) barbaric raiders, we need to eliminated all of them,...\"According to a M\u1ea1c\u2013Tr\u1ecbnh version of Complete Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, the new Emperor had a weakness for women. He had many wives, and he discarded one favorite after another. The most prominent scandal was his affair with Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ed9, the wife of his father's chief advisor Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i. The affair started early in 1442 and continued when the Emperor traveled to the home of Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, who was venerated as a great Confucian scholar.\nShortly after the Emperor left Tr\u00e3i's home to continue his tour of the western province, he fell ill and died. At the time the powerful nobles in the court argued that the Emperor had been poisoned to death. Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i was executed as were his three entire relations, the normal punishment for treason at that time.\n\n\n==== L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (ruled 1442\u20131459) ====\n\nWith the Emperor's sudden death at a young age, his infant heir Bang Co was made emperor- although he was the second son of his father, his older brother Nghi D\u00e2n had been officially passed over due to his mother's low social status. Bang Co assumed the throne as L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (\u9ece\u4ec1\u5b97)  but the real rulers were Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3 and the child's mother, the young Empress Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Anh. The next 17 years were good years for Vietnam \u2013 there were no great troubles either internally or externally. Two things of note occurred: first, the Vietnamese sent an army south to attack the Champa kingdom in 1446; second, the Dowager Empress ordered the execution of Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3, for reasons lost to history, in 1451.\nIn 1453 at the age of twelve, L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng was formally given the title of Emperor. This was unusual as according to custom, youths could not ascend the throne till the age of 16. It may have been done to remove Nguy\u1ec5n Thi Anh from power, but if that was the reason, it failed and the Dowager Empress still controlled the government up until a coup in 1459.\nIn 1459, L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng's older brother, Nghi D\u00e2n, plotted with a group of followers to kill the Emperor. On October 28, the plotters with some 100 \"shiftless men\" infiltrated the palace and murdered the Emperor (he was just 18). The next day, facing certain execution the Dowager Empress committed suicide. The rule of Nghi D\u00e2n was brief, and he was never officially recognized as a sovereign by later Vietnamese historians. Revolts against his rule started almost immediately and the second revolt, occurring on June 24, 1460, succeeded. The rebels, led by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's surviving former advsiors Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed and Dinh Li\u00eat captured and killed Nghi D\u00e2n along with his followers. The rebels then selected the youngest son of L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng to be the new Emperor, who they proclaimed to be L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng.\n\n\n==== L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (ruled 1460\u20131497) ====\n\nQuang Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ebf (\u5149\u9806\u7687\u5e1d),, whose reign was named H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecbnh Th\u1ebf (\u6d2a\u5fb7\u4e4b\u76db\u6cbb, \"Prosperous reign of H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c\"), instituted a wide range of government reforms, legal reforms, and land reforms. He restarted the examination system for selecting men for important government positions. He reduced the power of the noble families and reduced the degree of corruption in the government. He built temples to Confucius throughout the provinces of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. In nearly all respects, his reforms mirrored those of the Ming dynasty.\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was strongly influenced by his Confucian teachers and he resolved to make Vi\u1ec7t Nam more like the Ming Dynasty with its Neo-Confucianist philosophy and the key idea that the government should be run by men of noble character as opposed to men from noble families. This meant that he needed to take power away from the ruling families (mostly from Thanh H\u00f3a province) and give power to the scholars who did well on the official examinations. The first step on this path was to revive the examination process, which had continued sporadically in the 1450s. The first examination was held in 1463 and, as expected, the top scholars were men from elsewhere- usually from the river delta surrounding the capital, not from Thanh H\u00f3a.Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng encouraged the spread of Confucian values throughout Vietnam by having \"temples of literature\" built in all the provinces. There, Confucius was venerated and classic works on Confucianism could be found. He also halted the building of any new Buddhist or Taoist temples and ordered that monks were not to be allowed to purchase any new land.Following the Chinese model, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng divided the government into six ministries; they were Finance, Rites, Justice, Personnel, Army, and Public Works. Nine grades of rank were set up for both the civil administration and the military. A Board of Censors was set up with royal authority to monitor governmental officials and reported exclusively to the emperor. However, governmental authority did not extend all the way to the village level. The villages were ruled by their own councils in Vietnam.With the death of Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed  in 1465, the noble families from Thanh H\u00f3a province lost their leader. Soon they were mostly relegated to secondary positions in the new Confucian government of Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng. However, they still retained control over Vietnam's armies as the old general, \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t, was still in command of the army. In the same year, Vietnam was attacked by Ryukyuan pirates from the northeast. This was dealt with by sending additional forces to the north to fight the pirates. Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also sent a military force to the west to subdue the Ai-lao mountain tribes that was raiding the northwest border.In 1469, all of Vietnam was mapped and a full census was taken, listing all the villages in the Empire. Around this time the country was divided into 13 dao (provinces). Each was administrated by a Governor, Judge, and the local army commander. The emperor Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also ordered that a new census should be taken every six years. Other public works that were undertaken included building and repair of granaries, using the army to rebuild and repair irrigation systems after floods, and sending out doctors to areas afflicted by outbreaks of disease. Even though the emperor, at 25, was relatively young, he had already restored Vietnam's stability, which was a marked contrast from the turbulent times marking the reigns of the two emperors before him.\nSeveral Malay envoys from the Malacca sultanate were attacked and captured in 1469 by Vietnamese navy as they were returning to Malacca from China. The Vietnamese enslaved and castrated the young from among the captured. A 1472 entry in the Ming Shilu reported that some Chinese from Nanhai escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Revenue responded by ordering Chinese civilians and soldiers to stop going abroad to foreign countries. China's relations with Vietnam during this period were marked by the punishment of prisoners by castration.Under the order of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng, the official historical text of the L\u00ea Dynasty, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0 (\u5927\u8d8a\u53f2\u8a18\u5168\u66f8), was compiled and finished in 1479. The 15-volume book covered the entirety of Vietnamese history at that point, from the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng Dynasty to the enthronement of L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5.\n\n\n===== H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's campaigns against Champa and Lan Xang (1471\u20131480) =====\n\nIn 1471, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng conquered Champa and captured the Cham capital Vijaya, ending independent Cham rule in the south. The Kingdom of Champa was reduced to a small enclave near Panduranga (modern day Phan Rang\u2013Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m) and Kauthara (now Nha Trang) with many Chams fleeing to Cambodia. L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng created a new province out of former Cham land and allowed ethnic Vietnamese settlers to settle it. The conquest of the Cham kingdoms started a rapid period of expansion by the Vietnamese southwards into this newly conquered land. The government used a system of land settlement called \u0111\u1ed3n \u0111i\u1ec1n (\u5c6f\u7530)..\nFrom 1478 to 1480, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng led an expedition against kingdoms Lan Xang and Lanna in today Laos and Northern Thailand.  Laotians were overwhelmed, their capital Luang Prabang was captured. Laotians retreated to the jungles, waged two-years guerrilla warfare against the Vietnamese. King of Lan Xang Chakkaphat Phaen Phaeo seek refugee in Lanna.  Some of the Vietnamese army had reached the kingdom of Ava. The expedition ended in inclusive, many Vietnamese soldiers died because hostile climates and rampant disease; Vietnamese forces unable suppressed Laotian guerrillas, and then Laotians able to recaptured their capital. As the Vietnamese withdrew their army through kingdom of Muang Phuan in December 1479, they annexed and incorporated it into Ninh Protectorate (Tr\u1ea5n Ninh) in 1480.\n\n\n==== Decline of the L\u00ea dynasty ====\n\nWith the death of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng, the L\u00ea dynasty fell into a swift decline (1497\u20131527).\nPrince L\u00ea T\u0103ng, the eldest of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's 14 sons, succeeded his father as L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng (\u9ece\u61b2\u5b97). He was 38 years old at the time of his father's death. He was an affable, meek and mild-mannered person. Due to his short period of rule and that he didn't pass many significant reforms, his reign is considered to be an extension of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's rule. The new emperor was known to historical annals as L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng. In early 1499, several high-ranking officials including L\u00ea V\u0129nh and L\u00ea N\u0103ng Nh\u01b0\u1ee3ng persuaded Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng to choose an heir in order to maintain the dynasty's and the nation's security and sustainability. Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng agreed; and although the emperor had two elder sons: L\u00ea Tu\u00e2n and L\u00ea Tu\u1ea5n, L\u00ea Thu\u1ea7n was designed as crown prince due to his deep interest in intellectuality and Neo-Confucianism, which caused Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng to perceive him as being far superior to his two older brothers.L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng chose his third son, L\u00ea T\u00fac T\u00f4ng (\u9ece\u8085\u5b97) to be his successor. The 17 year-old L\u00ea T\u00fac T\u00f4ng was portrayed by court chroniclers as a wise emperor who maintained harmony in the court. In 1504, L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng died at 44 years old. The 17th years old L\u00ea Thu\u1ea7n inherited the throne. The Confucian annalists portrayed him as a relatively good emperor who released many prisoners, stopping several construction works that posed heavy burden on his subjects, as well as reducing tributes from vassals and holding high-ranking officials in high regard. He was also said to have maintained harmony in the court and the whole country. In the other hand, the annals also recorded a revolt broke in Cao B\u1eb1ng, led by \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ebf N\u00f9ng against the government. L\u00ea Thu\u1ea7n sent troops to Cao B\u1eb1ng, defeating and killing \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ebf N\u00f9ng along with 500 rebels.In 1504, L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng died at 44 years old.

L\u00ea Thu\u1ea7n sent troops to Cao B\u1eb1ng, defeating and killing \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ebf N\u00f9ng along with 500 rebels. However, he fell gravely ill and died just six months after assuming the throne.\nL\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c (\u9ece\u5a01\u7a46) was the second son of Emperor L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng. In 1505, as older brother of Emperor L\u00ea T\u00fac T\u00f4ng, he succeeded the throne, later known under posthumous name Uy M\u1ee5c ho\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ebf (\u5a01\u7a46\u7687\u5e1d). L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c was portrayed by Neo-Confucianist chroniclers as being deeply contrasted to his predecessors L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng, L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng and L\u00ea T\u00fac T\u00f4ng, who closely followed Neo-Confucianist principles in governing the nation. The first thing the new emperor did was to take revenge against those who had  barred him from the throne by having them killed.  Among his victims were the former emperor's mother \u2013 which was considered a shocking display of evil behavior. L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c was described by a Ming ambassador \u2013 as a cruel, sadistic, and depraved person, who wasted the court's money and finances to indulge his whims. Well aware that he was detested by his subjects, L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c protected himself by hiring a group of elite bodyguards to surround him at all times. Among them was M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, who became very close to the emperor and eventually rose to the rank of general. Despite his precautions, in 1509 a cousin, whom L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c had put in prison, escaped and plotted with court insiders to assassinate the emperor. The assassination succeeded and the killer proclaimed himself emperor under the name L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c.\nL\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c (\u9ece\u8944\u7ffc), posthumous name T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c Ho\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ebf (\u8944\u7ffc\u7687\u5e1d), proved to be just as bad a ruler as L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c. He reigned from 1510 to 1516, all the while spending down the royal treasury, and doing nothing to improve the country.  He was heedless to the reaction that his taxes caused throughout the country. Later in his reign, he spent extravagantly in building many colossal palaces in the imperial capital, Th\u0103ng Long. The most notable of those places was one  known to the Vietnamese as C\u1eedu Tr\u00f9ng \u0110\u00e0i, designed by the emperor's favoured architect V\u0169 Nh\u01b0 T\u00f4. He also spent much time enjoying sexual activities with his concubines, many of whom were former concubines of L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng and L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c. According to court chroniclers, he ordered  the build of special boats for his nude concubines to row on large artificial lakes. As the result of the emperor's luxurious lifestyle and ignorance of state affairs, the people suffered considerable hardships. Many soldiers committed to build imperial palaces died due to diseases. As the government became increasingly unpopular, many rebellions broke out. The largest of them was that of Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o, a northerner who claimed to be an heir of the House of Tr\u1ea7n. His rule ended in 1516 when a group officials and generals led by Tr\u1ecbnh Duy S\u1ea3n stormed the palace and killed him.\n\n\n==== Civil war ====\n\nAt 14 years old, nephew of L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c, prince L\u00ea Y, was enthroned as the new emperor L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng (ruled 1516\u20131522). Factions within the court vied with one another for control of the government. One powerful and growing faction was led by M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, a military leader who rose through the ranks. His growing power was resented by the leaders of two noble families in Vietnam: the Nguy\u1ec5n, under Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng D\u1ee5 and the Tr\u1ecbnh, under Tr\u1ecbnh Duy \u0110\u1ea1i and Tr\u1ecbnh Duy S\u1ea3n. After several years of increasing tension, the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh left the capital Hanoi (then called \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4) and fled south, with the Emperor \"under their protection\".\nIn 1524, M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung forces captured and executed the leaders of the revolt (Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng Du, Tr\u1ecbnh Duy \u0110\u1ea1i, and Tr\u1ecbnh Duy S\u1ea3n). The revolt by the Tr\u1ecbnh clan and the Nguy\u1ec5n clan was defeated for the moment. This was the start of a civil war with M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung and his supporters on one side and the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n on the other side. Thanh H\u00f3a Province, the ancestral home to the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n, was the battle ground between the two sides. After several years of warfare, Emperor L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng was assassinated in 1522 by M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung's supporters. Not long after, the leaders of the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh were executed. M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung was now the most powerful man in Vietnam.\n\n\n==== M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung usurps the throne ====\n\nThe degenerated L\u00ea dynasty, which endured under six rulers between 1497 and 1527, in the end was no longer able to maintain control over the northern part of the country, much less the new territories to the south. The weakening of the monarchy created a vacuum that the various noble families of the aristocracy were eager to fill. Soon after L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng fled south with the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1522, M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung proclaimed the Emperor's younger brother, L\u00ea Xu\u00e2n, as the new Emperor under the name L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng. In reality, the new Emperor had no power. Three years after M\u1ea1c's forces killed his older brother L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng, was pressured from M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, in B\u1eafc S\u1ee9 garden, L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng hanged himself on 18 June 1527. M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, being a scholar-official who had effectively controlled the L\u00ea for a decade, murdered all the L\u00ea royal family member then proclaimed himself the new Emperor of Vietnam on 15 June 1527, ending (so he thought) the L\u00ea dynasty (see M\u1ea1c dynasty for more details).\nM\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung's seizure of the throne prompted other families of the aristocracy, notably the Nguy\u1ec5n and Tr\u1ecbnh, to rush to the support of the L\u00ea royalists. With the usurpation of the throne, the civil war broke out anew. Again the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh gathered an army and fought against M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, this time under the leadership of Nguy\u1ec5n Kim and Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m. The Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n were nominally fighting on behalf of the L\u00ea emperor but in reality, for their own power.\n\n\n=== Southern and Northern Dynasties (1533\u20131597) ===\n\nThe L\u00ea royalists under L\u00ea Ninh, a descendant of the Royal family, escaped to Muang Phuan (today Laos). Marquis of An Thanh Nguy\u1ec5n Kim summoned the people who were still loyal to the L\u00ea emperor and formed a new army to begin a revolt against M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung. Subsequently, Nguy\u1ec5n Kim returned to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and led the L\u00ea royalists in a sixty-year-long civil war. In 1536 and 1537, Nguy\u00ean H\u00f2a sent two envoys to Beijing to ask Jiajing Emperor of Ming Dynasty to send army fight against the M\u1ea1c to restore the L\u00ea Dynasty. Many Ming officials like Mao B\u00e1 \u00d4n showed strong supports for the L\u00ea royalists and urged Jiajing Emperor for prepare a military campaign. The Ming Emperor agreed.In 1527, the V\u0169 V\u0103n (Wuwen) clan in H\u00e0 Giang and northern H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a (now southern Yunnan) rebelled against M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung and set up their own government. V\u0169 V\u0103n Uy\u00ean and his family rules were called B\u1ea7u Lords. In 1534, after Nguy\u1ec5n Kim forces recaptured Thanh H\u00f3a, V\u0169 V\u0103n Uy\u00ean declared allied with L\u00ea royalists and Ming army to fought against the M\u1ea1c Dynasty. But M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung himself in 1540 went and surrendered the Ming army, wished for peace. M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung ceded the northeast Vietnamese coastal to the Ming Dynasty for exchanging that the Ming dynasty would never invade Vietnam again. The Chinese now recognized both M\u1ea1c and L\u00ea legitimacy over \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and withdrew their army. B\u1ea7u Lords showed strong support for the L\u00ea dynasty and refused to accept Tr\u1ecbnh family at the early stage of Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War. Later, they cooperated with the Tr\u1ecbnh. B\u1ea7u Lords lasted for nearly 200 years from 1527 to 1699.\nIn 1542, L\u00ea army from Muang Phuan recaptured Ngh\u1ec7 An. M\u1ea1c general D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ch\u1ea5p Nh\u1ea5t surrendered. After capturing the region of Thanh H\u00f3a and Ngh\u1ec7 An, the Revival L\u00ea dynasty eventually recaptured three-quarters of their former kingdom. Inasmuch as the Mac dynasty ruled the northern portion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t while the L\u00ea dynasty ruled the remainder of the country, this time became known as the period of Northern and Southern dynasties.\nIn 1545, Nguy\u1ec5n Kim was poisoned by D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ch\u1ea5p Nh\u1ea5t), a surrendered general of the M\u1ea1c dynasty. The power of royal court was then passed to Nguy\u1ec5n Kim's son-in-law Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m who became the founder of the Tr\u1ecbnh lords. Since then the emperor has only become a figurehead, Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m and his successors were the de facto rulers of the country and continue the war with the M\u1ea1c. The war has three actual fighting periods: 1533\u20131537, 1551\u20131564 and 1584\u20131592. During the early confront period, the L\u00ea dynasty introduced personnel firearm like matchlocks into their army and surprised the M\u1ea1c army.Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f9ng succeed his father in 1570, established the Tr\u1ecbnh lords and launched a large-scale offensive against the M\u1ea1c army in January 1592. Unable to resist the forces of the L\u00ea royalists, in December 1592 the M\u1ea1c dynasty retreated to the north and established a new capital at Cao B\u1eb1ng Province allying with the Ming dynasty of China as a tributary nation against the L\u00ea dynasty.\n\n\n=== Restored L\u00ea (1597\u20131789) ===\nIn 1597, the Ming dynasty recognized the legitimacy of the L\u00ea monarch. However, the Ming recorded that the L\u00ea rulers were very dissatisfied to the Ming Empire because the Chinese had supported for the Northern M\u1ea1c. In 1589, Toyotomi Hideyoshi sent an envoys to L\u00ea court in Thanh Ho\u00e1, called Vietnamese to join Japan's alliance against Ming China and Joseon Korea. In Toyotomi Hideyoshi's view, Japan's attack on the Ming Dynasty from the northeast, Vietnam from the south, and Southeast Asian countries from the southeast to the north will inevitably put the Ming Dynasty into a state of exhaustion. Although some people supported for the plan, the L\u00ea emperor Quang H\u01b0ng and his ministers acknowledged the might of Ming army; the L\u00ea ministers further viewing Japan as other Southeast Asian nations as \"barbarians\" and formally decided refused the Japanese lord's invitation.Later, the first son of Nguy\u1ec5n Kim, (Nguy\u1ec5n U\u00f4ng) was assassinated by Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m. Nguy\u1ec5n Kim's second son, Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng, relocated to the south, became the Viceroy of Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e1 province, founded the line of Nguy\u1ec5n lords, and started a revolt against the reign of the Tr\u1ecbnh lords. As such, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was divided for 232 years as the two lords fought each other in what is now known as the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil War.\n\n\n==== Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n contention ====\n\nIn 1620, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean officially refused to send taxes to the court in Hanoi. A formal demand was made to the Nguy\u1ec5n to submit to the authority of the court, and it was formally refused. In 1623 Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f9ng died and was succeeded by his son Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng. Now Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng made a formal demand for submission, and again Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean refused. Finally in 1627 open warfare broke out between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n. For four months a large Tr\u1ecbnh army battled against the Nguy\u1ec5n army but were unable to defeat them. The result of this war was that Vietnam had effectively been partitioned into northern and southern regions, with the Tr\u1ecbnh controlling most of the north and the Nguy\u1ec5n controlling most of the south; the dividing line was the Gianh River in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province. This border was very close to the Seventeenth parallel (in actuality the B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River located just to the south in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province), which was imposed as the border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam during the Partition of Vietnam (1954\u201375).While the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled over a much more populous territory, the Nguy\u1ec5n had several advantages. First, they were on the defensive. Second, the Nguy\u1ec5n were able to take advantage of their contacts with the Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, to purchase advanced European weapons and hire European military experts in fortifications. Third, the geography was favorable to them, as the flat land suitable for large organized armies is very narrow at this point of Vietnam; the mountains nearly reach to the sea.After the first assault, the Nguy\u1ec5n built two massive fortified lines which stretched a few miles from the sea to the hills. The walls were built north of Hu\u1ebf near the city of \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi. The Nguy\u1ec5n defended these lines against numerous Tr\u1ecbnh offensives which lasted till 1672. The story from this time is that the great military engineer was a Vietnamese general who was hired away from the Tr\u1ecbnh court by the Nguy\u1ec5n. This man is given the credit in Vietnam for the successful design of the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. Against the walls the Tr\u1ecbnh mustered an army of 100,000 men, 500 elephants, and 500 large ships (Dupuy \"Encyclopedia of Military History\" pg. 596). The initial attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n wall was unsuccessful. The attacks lasted for several years.\n\nIn 1633 the Tr\u1ecbnh tried an amphibious assault on the Nguy\u1ec5n to get around the wall. The Tr\u1ecbnh fleet was defeated by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet at the battle of Nhat-Le. Around 1635 the Tr\u1ecbnh learned the Nguy\u1ec5n and sought military aid from the Europeans. Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng hired the VOC to make European cannons and ships for the Royal army. In 1642\u201343, the Tr\u1ecbnh army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. With the aid of the Dutch cannons, the Tr\u1ecbnh army broke through the first wall but failed to break through the second. At sea, the Tr\u1ecbnh, with their Dutch ships Kievit, Nachtegaels and Woekende Book were destroyed in a humiliating defeat by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet with their Chinese style galleys. Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng staged yet another offensive in 1648 but at the battle of Truong Duc, the Royal army was badly beaten by the Nguy\u1ec5n. The new L\u00ea king died around this time, perhaps as a result of the defeat. This now left the door open for the Nguy\u1ec5n to finally go on the offensive.\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n launched their own invasion of northern Vietnam in 1653. The Nguy\u1ec5n army attacked north and defeated the weakened Royal army. Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province was captured. Then H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province fell to the Nguy\u1ec5n army. In the following year, Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng died as Nguy\u1ec5n forces made attacks into Ngh\u1ec7 An Province. Under a new Tr\u1ecbnh Lord, the capable Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c, the Royal army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n army and defeated it. The Nguy\u1ec5n were fatally weakened by a division between their two top generals who refused to cooperate with each other. In 1656 the Nguy\u1ec5n army was driven back all the way to their original walls. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c tried to break the walls of the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1661 but this attack, like so many before it, failed to break through the walls.\nIn 1672, the Tr\u1ecbnh army made a last effort to conquer the Nguy\u1ec5n. The attacking army was under the command of Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c's son, Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n, while the defending army was under the command of Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n's son Prince Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1eadn. The attack, like all the previous attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n walls, failed. This time the two sides agreed to a peace. With mediation supplied by the government of the Kangxi Emperor, the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n finally agreed to end the fighting by making the Linh River the border between their lands (1673). Although the Nguy\u1ec5n nominally accepted the L\u00ea King as the ruler of Vietnam, the reality was, the Nguy\u1ec5n ruled the south, and the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled the north. This division continued for the next 100 years. The border between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n was strongly guarded but peaceful. Despite the partition, both the two families claimed themselves loyal to the Royal family, and their territories were all counted as \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's land.\n\n\n==== T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion and the end of dynasty ====\n\nThe stalemate between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n lords that began at the end of the 17th century did not, however, mark the beginning of a period of peace and prosperity. Instead the decades of continual warfare between the two families had left the ruists and peasantry in a weakened state, the victim of taxes levied to support the courts and their military adventures. Having to meet their tax obligations had forced many peasants off the land and facilitated the acquisition of large tracts by a few wealthy landowners, nobles, and scholar\u2014officials. Because scholar\u2014officials were exempted from having to pay a land tax, the more land they acquired, the greater was the burden that fell on those peasants who had been able to retain their land. In addition, the peasantry faced new taxes on staple items such as charcoal, salt, silk, and cinnamon, and on commercial activities such as fishing and mining. The disparate condition of the economy led to neglect of the extensive network of irrigation systems as well.\n\nAs they fell into disrepair, disastrous flooding and famine resulted, unleashing great numbers of starving and landless people to wander aimlessly about the countryside. The widespread suffering in North Vietnam led to numerous peasant revolts between 1730 and 1770, notable the peasant rebellion of Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea7u from 1748 to 1751. Although the uprisings took place throughout the country, they were essentially local phenomena, breaking out spontaneously from similar local causes. The occasional coordination between and among local movements did not result in any national organization or leadership. Moreover, most of the uprisings were conservative, in that the leaders supported the restoration of the L\u00ea dynasty. They did, however, put forward demands for land reform, more equitable taxes, and rice for all. Landless peasants accounted for most of the initial support for the various rebellions, but they were often joined later by craftsmen, fishermen, miners, and traders, who had been taxed out of their occupations. Some of these movements enjoyed limited success for a short time, but it was not until 1771 that any of the peasant revolts had a lasting national impact.Dissatisfaction against two ruling families Tr\u1ecbnh and Nguy\u1ec5n spread through out the country. In 1771, three brothers Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c, Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 in An Kh\u00ea, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh with local peasants support, revolted against the Nguy\u1ec5n lord. In 1773, the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n captured Quy Nh\u01a1n fort in 1773, gave them financial and manpower support, thus made the rebellion and became widespread. In 1774, Tr\u1ecbnh army from the north launched an offensive against the Nguy\u1ec5n. Unable to fight two-front war, Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1ea7n lost the control of Cochinchina, fled by ship to the Mekong delta. He later was taken and executed by the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n in 1777. The renmant Nguyen led by Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh with help from the French priest Pigneau de Behaine (B\u00e1 \u0110a L\u1ed9c), he soon recruited his army by enlisted French, Cambodian troops and weapons, but mostly were defeated by the superior and numberior T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebels in four times, and \u00c1nh went exiled in Siam. The T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion were not content to simply conquer the southern provinces of the country. After a decade of fairly successful fighting in the south against the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 (the leading general of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n and no relation to the Nguy\u1ec5n ruling family) and his army marched north in 1786. The Royal army under Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f4ng vanquished by Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f4ng committed suicide and the L\u00ea Emperor submitted to the wishes of the victorious Hu\u1ec7 by giving his daughter in marriage to him. Hu\u1ec7 returned south and a few months later, the old emperor died.When L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng assumed the throne, the Tr\u1ecbnh tried to reassert control over the government. This provoked another march north from Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 and so the Emperor and the Tr\u1ecbnh fled from Dongkinh. L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng sent envoy to the Imperial court of the Qing Empire to ask for aid against the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n. The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire under the pretense of restoring L\u00ea dynasty dispatched a large force of 200,000 soldiers, to invade Northern Vietnam, captured the capital Th\u0103ng Long.At the beginning of the war, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops retreated to the South and refused to engage the Qing army. He raised a large army of his own and defeated the invader in the Lunar New year Eve of 1789. Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng and the Royal family fled north into China, never to return. The L\u00ea Dynasty finally ended after ruled Vietnam for 356 years. He went to Beijing where he was appointed a Chinese mandarin of the fourth rank in the  Han Yellow Bordered Banner, while lower ranking loyalists were sent to cultivate government land and join the Green Standard Army in Sichuan and Zhejiang. They adopted Qing clothing and adopt the queue hairstyle, effectively becoming naturalized subjects of the Qing dynasty affording them protection against Vietnamese demands for extradition. Some L\u00ea loyalists were also sent to Central Asia in Urumqi. Modern descendants of the L\u00ea monarch can be traced to southern Vietnam and Urumqi, Xinjiang.\n\n\n== Culture, society, and science ==\n\n\n=== Clothing and customs ===\n\nAfter ending the Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam, people of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t started to rebuild the country. The dress regulation for emperor and the bureaucracy was learned from the previous dynasties of Vietnam and Ming dynasty of China. In later L\u00ea dynasty, cross-collared robe called \u00e1o giao l\u0129nh was popular among civilians. A royal edict was issued by Vietnam in 1474 forbidding Vietnamese from adopting foreign languages, hairstyles and clothes like that of the Lao, Champa or the Ming \"Northerners\".Before 1744, people of both \u0110\u00e0ng Ngo\u00e0i (the north) and \u0110\u00e0ng Trong (the south) wore giao l\u00e3nh y with th\u01b0\u1eddng (a kind of long skirt). Both male and female had loose long hair. In 1744, Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t of \u0110\u00e0ng Trong (Hu\u1ebf) decreed that both men and women at his court wear trousers and a gown with buttons down the front. That the Nguyen Lords introduced ancient \u00e1o d\u00e0i (\u00e1o ng\u0169 th\u00e2n). The members of the \u0110\u00e0ng Trong court (southern court) were thus distinguished from the courtiers of the Tr\u1ecbnh Lords in \u0110\u00e0ng Ngo\u00e0i (Hanoi), who wore \u00e1o giao l\u0129nh with long skirts. The partition between two families over the country too long so caused the some major differences in Vietnamese dialect and culture between Northern and Southern Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Introduction of Christianity ===\nEuropean missionaries had occasionally visited Vietnam for short periods of time, with little impact, beginning in the early sixteenth century. Kh\u00e2m \u0111\u1ecbnh Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed Th\u00f4ng gi\u00e1m c\u01b0\u01a1ng m\u1ee5c recorded first Christian missionarier name In\u00e1cio in the first year of Nguy\u00ean Ho\u00e0 Emperor (1533) in Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh. From 1580 to 1586, two Portuguese and French missionaries Luis de Fonseca and Gr\u00e9goire de la Motte worked in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam and Quy Nh\u01a1n region under lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng. After the L\u00ea\u2013M\u1ea1c War ended and peace was restored in 1593, more missionaries from Spain, Portugal France, Italy and Poland came to Vietname to spread Christianity.  The best known of the early missionaries was Alexandre de Rhodes, a French Jesuit who was sent to Hanoi in 1627, where he quickly learned the language and began preaching in Vietnamese. Initially, Rhodes was well received by the Trinh court, and he reportedly baptized more than 6,000 converts; however, his success probably led to his expulsion in 1630. He is credited with perfecting a romanized system of writing the Vietnamese language (qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef), which was probably developed as the joint effort of several missionaries, including Rhodes. He wrote the first catechism in Vietnamese and published a Vietnamese-Latin-Portuguese dictionary; these works were the first books printed in qu\u1ed1c-ng\u1eef. Qu\u1ed1c-ng\u1eef was used initially only by missionaries; h\u00e1n t\u1ef1 or ch\u1eef n\u00f4m continued to be used by the court and the bureaucracy. The French later supported the use of qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, which, because of its simplicity, led to a high degree of literacy and a flourishing of Vietnamese literature. After being expelled from Vietnam, Rhodes spent the next thirty years seeking support for his missionary work from the Vatican and the French Roman Catholic hierarchy as well as making several more trips to Vietnam. However, since 1910, Latinized Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef was adopted by the French governor as the main writing system of Vietnam, while h\u00e1n t\u1ef1 and n\u00f4m t\u1ef1 fell into declinine. Vietnamese Christianity developed and became stronger before it was cracked down on by Emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty in the 1820s.\n\n\n=== Science and Philosophy ===\n\nThe L\u00ea period was the continuously flourish era of Vietnamese scientific and Confucianism scholaric. Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i was a 15th-century L\u00ea official, author of geography book D\u01b0 \u0111\u1ecba ch\u00ed, also  was a Neo-Confucianist scholar. L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n was a poet, encyclopedist, and government official, author of the geography book Ph\u1ee7 bi\u00ean t\u1ea1p l\u1ee5c. H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng L\u00e3n \u00d4ng was a famous Vietnamese doctor and pharmacist with his full collection 28-volumes H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng y t\u00f4ng t\u00e2m l\u0129nh about traditional Vietnamese medicine. Matchlock firearms technology also spread from Mughal Empire to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t in 1516, and was adopted by the L\u00ea army by the 1530s.\n\n\n=== Literature and arts ===\nWritten Chinese was the predominant writing language in Vietnam throughout the L\u00ea dynasty, although written vernacular Vietnamese using ch\u1eef N\u00f4m became increasingly popular in the 17th century. During the L\u00ea dynasty, various forms of Vietnamese literature and art flourished, including poetry, painting, novels, h\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng, ch\u00e8o, c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng, and ca tr\u00f9. Many writers wrote in H\u00e1n t\u1ef1 or ch\u1eef N\u00f4m; for example, Nguy\u1ec5n Du's The Tale of Ki\u1ec1u, \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ecb \u0110i\u1ec3m's Chinh ph\u1ee5 ng\u00e2m, and Nguy\u1ec5n Gia Thi\u1ec1u's Cung o\u00e1n ng\u00e2m kh\u00fac.\nThe art forms of that time prospered and produced items of great artistic value, despite the upheavals and wars. Woodcarving was especially highly developed and produced items that were used for daily use or worship. Many of these items can be seen in the National Museum in Hanoi.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education and imperial examination system ==\n\nIn late 1426, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i held a small Confucian examination in \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh, graduated 30 ti\u1ebfn s\u0129. From 1431, the court annually held Provincial and metropolitan exams were organized in three sessions. The first session took place in every province, consisted of three questions on the examinee's interpretation of the Four Books, and four on the Classics corpus. Everyone who passed the first session were called Sinh \u0111\u1ed3 and H\u01b0\u01a1ng c\u1ed1ng. The second session took place in the capital one year later, and consisted of a discursive essay, a based Tang poetry, five critical judgments, and one in the style of an edict, an announcement and a memorial. Three days after that, the third session was held by the emperor, consisting of five essays on the Classics, historiography, and contemporary affairs. From 1486, every mandarin candidates must participated both first and second session to approve the chain. The Le's examination system reflected the Ming's imperial examination.During the period from 1426 to 1527, the L\u00ea dynasty held 26 Imperial examinations in the capital, graduated 989 ti\u1ebfn s\u0129 and 20 tr\u1ea1ng nguy\u00ean. By the 1750s, Neo-Confucianism were declining, the imperial examinations began having surplus graduates, downgrading quality of jinshi and mandarin, corruptions, the court prefer children of noble families to be mandarins that take check, thus made the downfall of Confucian examination system in Vietnam in the late 18th century until the established of Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty.Scholars and administrators who graduated from the imperial examination system during the L\u00ea dynasty include Nguy\u1ec5n B\u1ec9nh Khi\u00eam, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Du\u1ec7, Ph\u00f9ng Kh\u1eafc Khoan, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n, L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh, and Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u0103ng \u0110\u1ea1o.\n\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n\nIn 1428, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i established a tributary relationship with the Ming dynasty in exchange for the recognition and formal protection of his kingdom. Xuande Emperor gave L\u00ea L\u1ee3i the title \"An Nam Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (king of Annam), thus recognized Vietnamese independent and sovereignty and this tradition lasted to 1526. Also part of the tributary relationship was the responsibility of the Ming to provide external military support to the L\u00ea state. Ming support for the L\u00ea against the M\u1ea1c uprising arrived in 1537. After the 1540 surrender of the M\u1ea1c to the Ming, the Ming court ceremonially revoked the M\u1ea1c dynasty's status as an independent kingdom and reclassified it as a dutongshisi: a category only slightly higher than a chieftaincy. After 1540, the Ming received tribute from both the L\u00ea dynasty and the M\u1ea1c, a state of affairs that continued through the Qing dynasty. From 1647, the Southern Ming reclassified Annam as a independent kingdom, giving L\u00ea Duy K\u1ef3 the title \"An Nam Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (\u5b89\u5357\u56fd\u738b) again. In 1667, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing empire gave the title An Nam Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u01a1ng to Viet king L\u00ea Duy V\u0169 through a successful Vietnamese diplomatic mission.Outside China, the L\u00ea dynasty had its own tributary relationships with Panduranga, Lan Xang, Cambodia. Vietnamese historiography notes that contact between Vietnam and the Holy See or Vatican was established during the reign of emperor L\u00ea Th\u1ebf T\u00f4ng (1572\u20131599) through a diplomacy letter in Classical Chinese that is held in a Vatican library in the modern day.The seventeenth century was also a period in which European missionaries and merchants became a serious factor in Vietnamese court life and politics. Although both had arrived by the early sixteenth century, neither foreign merchants nor missionaries had much impact on Vietnam before the seventeenth century. The Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French had all established trading posts in Ph\u1ed5 Hi\u1ec1n by 1680. Fighting among the Europeans and opposition by the Vietnamese made the enterprises unprofitable, however, and all of the foreign trading posts were closed by 1800.\n\n\n== Economic development ==\n\nBefore 1527, the Imperial court restricted people for foreign trade, main focused on agriculture and local market, addition the period of political unstable from 1505 to 1527 made the country's economy quickly shrink down. There was series of severe famines in H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng prefecture and Kinh B\u1eafc prefecture (B\u1eafc Ninh, B\u1eafc Giang) occurred in 1517 to 1521 during the reign of L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c. The sixteen-century political crisis caused severe damages to Vietnamese's agriculture and conscription required  by incessant military campaigns, compounded by natural disasters, largely contributed to regular crop failures. Number of landless peasant grew quickly, causing a disproportionate surplus of unemployed labours in Northern Vietnam. After M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung gained power in 1527, he sought to restore the economy by encouraging these unemployed peasants into city and factories, pursuing massive handicraft industrial and sea trading, shifted the economy from mainly on farming to sea-traders from the Red River delta to the Eastern coast. Vietnamese merchants and sailors formed together built medium-size ships in Hai Mon port (now Hai Phong) and quickly gained dominant on the South China sea trade route, mostly sailed from Japan to Malacca to sold silk and ceramic. Some of them eventually reached Egypt and Greece under Ottoman's rule around the 1570s. After recaptured Dong Kinh in 1592, the L\u00ea-Tr\u1ecbnh court acknowledge the benefits of oversea trading, continue encourages handicraft industrial and opened some international ports like Hoi An, Dong Kinh for the presence of foreign merchants. About 80% of the population were farmers and peasants; they worked on lands mostly were held by \u0111\u1ecba ch\u1ee7 or the landlords. The economy was devastated in some regions of the country due to two long civil war and unstable, however, in most part of the country which were unaffected area, peace were maintained for a long time, saw a rise of urbanization and pre-capitalism society in Vietnam around late 16th to 18th century.In contrast to the overpopulation Red river delta, Thuan Hoa and Quang Nam region were still less dense. Vietnamese people had begun settling in the conquered Cham land at least since the 1400s. After Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng appointed the governor of southern provinces in 1572, million people migrated to the south, resulted in new opened cities and harbors along the coastline. For centuries the Nguy\u1ec5n's economy mostly depended on handicraft industrial and international trade. Until the later 18th century, due to deadly epidemic, severe flood in Red River Delta, the immense corruption of the government and the rise of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n peasant rebellion in Southern Vietnam, that later spread entire country, devastated most of the economy and international trading, played a important role for the collapse of the dynasty.\n\n\n=== \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh and urban life ===\n\n\u0110\u00f4ng Kinh, the capital of Vietnam since the 11th century, during the Later L\u00ea Dynasty it was divided into 13 districts and 239 wards (with 36 main business-trading wards) and communes. Dong Kinh since mid-1500s became the silk and ceramic manufacturing center of Southeast Asia. Vietnamese merchants exported to Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire Tonkinese octagonal bottles with underglaze-cobalt decoration or dishes with peony sprays painted in underglaze-cobalt were considered as good as Chinese products. Vietnamese ceramic from B\u00e1t Tr\u00e0ng villages produce famous high-quality pottery and dishes.\n\nThey [The Vietnamese] have porcelain and pottery-some of them great value-and these go from there to China to be sold.\nTom\u00e9 Pires, 1515 \nChinese and Japanese traders came to Dong Kinh to buy both high quality silk and raw silk. Besides silk textiles were made by villages, majority of them were produced in state-owned factories in Dong Kinh, which produced for the Royal family, noblemen and foreigners. In 1637, the Dutch successfully established commercial and diplomatic relations with Tonkin and maintained their trading station in the capital of Th\u0103ng Long (present-day Hanoi) until 1700. The lucrative Dutch \u2018Vietnamese-silk-for-Japanese-silver trade\u2018 later also attracted the English and the French to Tonkin in 1672 and early 1682 respectively.  The British imported Vietnamese silk around the 1670s, but not regularly. The city had a Chinatown, factories owned by Dutch, English companies along the Red river. In 1594, the Imperial court allows the Western presence in the capital, encouraged Dutch, Spanish and British to open trading ports. In 1616, the British established a factory in \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh, but their business were ended in failure due to the pressures from the L\u00ea court, and finally withdrew in 1720. During the 17th and 18th century, Westerners commonly used the name Tonkin (from \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh) to refer to northern Vietnam, then ruled by the Tr\u1ecbnh lords (while Cochinchina was used to refer to Southern Vietnam, then ruled by the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, and Annam, from the name of the former Chinese province was used to refer to Vietnam as a whole). Tonkin had been a major industrial factory and trading center in Asia until the 1730s. The prosperity during the Le dynasty was described through the urbanization in Tonkin through Western narratives: \"...Cachao (Dong Kinh) probably had 200,000 houses. The city size was some larger than some the largest cities in Europe but similar size to other major Asian cities. It lies along the Red river...there are 36 stone-paved major streets, many people from areas to foreigners such as Chinese, Japanese, English held their business companies, factories and stores here...the Emperor has three small but magnificent palaces, mostly built by red wood and terracotta bricks, surrounded by 15-feet height wall, and its main gate never opens expect when the Emperor wants to go outside. The Trinh lord and his families live in 30-meter height Ng\u0169 Long castle, near T\u1ea1 V\u1ecdng lake, can be seen the highest from the Red river...\"\n\nIn 1612, Joseon army encountered a Vietnamese merchant ship from Tonkin wrecked in Jeju Island carried a lot of treasures and money. The Koreans killed all sailors, looted treasures on board then falsely reported the ship \"was a pirate ship\".However, by the last quarter of the 1600s, Tonkin was no longer a profitable trading place. Vietnamese silk no longer reaped a handsome profit in Japan and Vietnamese ceramics proved unmarketable in the insular Southeast Asian markets. In Tonkin, trading conditions also deteriorated rapidly. Subsequently, natural disasters ravaged the economy of the country and a wave of successive famines discouraged local craftsmen from producing goods for export. Worse still, after the protracted civil war with the southern Vietnamese kingdom of Quinam (or \u0110\u00e0ng Trong) ended in 1672, the Tonkinese rulers seemed to be more indifferent towards foreign trade as they were no longer in urgent need of a supply of weapons from the Westerners. Bearing in mind their long-term strategy, especially the prospect of opening up trading relations with China, the Dutch still wanted to maintain their Tonkin trade despite its current unprofitable state, perceiving that it would be extremely difficult to re-establish the relationship with Tonkin once they left the country. Despite the Dutch persistence, the relationship between the VOC and Tonkin deteriorated rapidly during the last two decades of the seventeenth century, especially after Ch\u00faa (Lord) Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n (r. 1682\u20131709) succeeded to the throne.\n\n\n=== H\u1ed9i An ===\n\nThe area of Qu\u1ea3ng Nam river original was part of Champa kingdoms and was annexed by \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t during Emperor Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng 's reign. It was opened for foreign merchants trade and settlement. In 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng in 1570. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An. In 1640, Nguy\u1ec5n lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Lan ordered to close all Dutch stores and factories in H\u1ed9i An, ban the Dutch for trading in Cochinchina because he suspected the VOC allying with the Tr\u1ecbnh lord in the north. In the 17th century, Polish Jesuit missionary Wojciech M\u0119ci\u0144ski was believed to visited H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. Trading activities and handicraft manufacturing had been shifted from Tonkin to H\u1ed9i An. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.H\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion \u2013 which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.\n\n\n=== Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh ===\n\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.\nIn 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble and explorer, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by ship to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement of Kinh and Hoa people. A large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a (see Citadel of Saigon). Initially called Gia Dinh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.

          "We were part of an escorted tour that was taken to the Thanh Ha Potter village. The boat trip across the river was enjoyable and, if honest, a better attraction than the village. Yes, the making of clay was interesting to watch and the spinning of the clay wheel by foot. Yes,",
          "This is a great way to spend a few hours in Hoi An - there was 3 generations of us and we all had a ball. Not only do they show off their pottery making skills in person right in front of you but then invite you to have a go on the wheel yourself - and you even get to sign your",

          "This was probably one of the most well thought out and designed museum spaces I have ever been to. Not a big place, but the incorporation of the terracotta pottery work with the landscape and architecture was beautiful. Lovely that you can see and learn about the history, the",
          "We rented a motor bike and had a ball going form village to village. But really not much to buy there. Most of the pottery didn't even seem that it was made there. lots of little chatchkee's (sp.) lol But as a village that people lived in, it was nice to get out of the touristy",
          "One of the staff at the hotel where we were staying escorted us here, a nice change from the old town. Lovely rural views and the Thanh Ha village was quaint, walked along the river to a pottery house. Here the 93 year old expert potter demonstrated her amazing skills and before",

          "Visited here and enjoyed the pottery lesson with the 92 year old grandma, but don't be fooled by the 'cheap' prices as you can actually buy similar products in Hoi An ancient town at much cheaper prices. It's still worth a visit though.",
          "There was this amazing old woman. She can't stand up straight, her back is bent a right angle from squating so long. Her granddaughter spun the wheel with her foot and the old woman started with a great big mound of clay. She made one item after another. First a bowl, than the",
          "We briefly stopped at the pottery village during our boat tour. An old lady demonstrated the potter's wheel and we were shown some items to buy. We bought a beautiful little tea set, but the visit was really a little to brief to say much about it.",
          "A bit disappointed with our visit to this village, guess we were expecting more. I was looking forward to buying pottery hand made but was only offered the same sort of things available all over Vietnam.",
          "I went to this village about 3 years ago and it wasn't signed and so obvious as it is now. Now you are asked to pay a small entry fee into the area however it is worth it. The ladies making the pottery seem genuinely to enjoy showing their skills to visitors and even though",

          "it was a very humbling experience riding through this little village. i was more than happy to pay a small fee at the entrance but very disappointing to hear people haggling over $1. when you see how real locals live it is quite saddening, no windows on the houses etc. to be",
          "Everybody heads to the old town, but they're missing out on a little gem. Small fee at the gate.There's an old Pagoda which is next to the entrance to one of the most gorgeous villages I've ever seen. I didn't see any men, just women and children. You get to see the villagers",

          "Was interesting to see pots being made - this is only a short visit/tour. No automation here - even the wheel is turned by feet",
          "We travelled out by taxi and the taxi waited for 100 dong. We enjoyed walking around the village more than the pottery. Fun to see not far from the town centre.",

          "An interesting visit through a small village but we saw disturbing actions from the village people. Upon arrival, we were given a chance to try making pottery on a wheel turned by foot, which my daughter loved. Walking through the alleys, we really felt as voyeurs walking in",
          "It was good experience first stop, but then people in the village kept asking us to buy stuffs which was very annoying",
          "It seems we had quite a different experience to some of the reviewers here. No tour. Just paid 25000 VND to enter one room, see an old lady through a pot (admittedly very well), a few other tourists have a go at throwing a pot, and then be totally misled into buying what we were",
          "I visited this island as part of a Hoi An and countryside tour with the excellent Mr Turtle. The boat trio from Hoi An was great, we also visited the carpentry island. I was shown around the island and got to see the processes of making pots and also have some unusual usage of",
          "This is a family ran business and pottery is made by traditional methods - the potters wheel is powered by a foot and kilns fired by wood. Some nice original pieces and if you visit the children give you a gift of a clay whistle in the shape of various animals. lovely!",
          "I enjoyed a lovely bike ride out of Hoian to see the village (got a little lost though - bear left at the intersection!). I got chased down by a woman at the ticket booth for the 25,000 entrance fee - I'm not really sure what that's for, since there really isn't anything to see.",
          "Had a great insight when Ms Hau gave us the opportunity to try making pottery with clay and also teaching us the process of baking and solidifying the clay pots/cups/jars and even savings/coin box! Their friendliness included a pottery souvenir to take home! Thank you!",
          "Just too close for a taxi. Quite a ride by bike. It boasts a clay mini town with the major attractions such as the Taj Mahal. The detail is amazing. Stroll along the quaint village and grab your free clay whistle at any of the stores. The supermarket in the main road next to",

          "We hired a boat on Thu Bon river and en route stopped about 30 minutes at Thanh ha Village. It was great to enjoy the boat, but the village is not so worth. There are not many workshops left. Most of them are for selling souvenirs which can be found in Hai Duong, Bat trang and",
          "One of the staff from my hotel took me here on the back of their motorbike and took me to a small workshop. Similarly to other reviews described below I was invited to make a pot as did the hotel staff member. There was a display of vintage disc pottery made by the vendors",

          "Everyone was friendly at a first, and we enjoyed taking a try at the potter's wheel; but then the potter began to exert pressure for us to buy something--and became annoyed when we chose not to. She then put her hand out for money, I assume for the time she spent with my husband",

          "every store has the same stuff and sob stories wanting you to buy un fired clay. They charge you to get into the village but then you are left to your own divices and harassed by one or two shop owners. There are some factories here doing some interesting work if you can get to",

          "Very touristy and high pressure to buy. We pedal biked there and got a little lost, when we did arrive you have to buy an inexpensive ticket to enter. The pottery merchants are very high pressure to get you to buy- not unexpected but we really didn't find anyone making really",
          "We had set out from our hotel to find the Thanh Ha pottery village but after wandering about what was a cute fishing village I announced that I thought we were lost and we wouldn't be able to find the pottery. At this a local stopped and said \"pottery\" and set off waving his",

          "What could be more wonderful than a pottery made by myself! I used to think that it was very easy to make those pottery. It was not until I came here, I realized how hard and difficult in making those simple things. First we were shown the complete beautiful pottery made by the",
          "The village is stimulated by the governement to keep the hand work going. You walk around the town with friendly people. Stop at one of the shops were you are shown how the pottery is made. You can give it a try yourself. It is not that easy. The items made are not really used",

        "wiki": "The Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was a clash between United States Navy warships and Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) MiG-17F fighter bombers, several torpedo boats and shore batteries on April 19, 1972 during the Vietnam War. This was the first time U.S. warships faced an air raid since the end of World War II.\nThe Battle for \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi Gulf involved fierce firefights when Navy ships attempted to stop North Vietnamese troops and supplies transiting the coast highway in North Vietnam from reaching the battle front in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province. The air raid described here marked the end of daylight raids by the Navy. Within a few weeks, however, all North Vietnamese resistance at \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was suppressed.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe U.S. warships involved were the 7th Fleet flagship, guided missile cruiser USS Oklahoma City, the guided missile frigate USS Sterett, and destroyers USS Lloyd Thomas and USS Higbee.The American warships operating in the Gulf of Tonkin were shelling North Vietnamese coastal targets around \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi, Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province, North Central Coast region near the DMZ along the 17th parallel, the provisional borderline between South Vietnam and North Vietnam when they were attacked by VPAF MiGs in the first air attack on U.S. naval forces in the Vietnam War.\nAt approximately 17:00, USS Sterett detected three hostile aircraft approaching the navy ships. One of the MiG-17s scored a direct hit on USS Higbee with a BETAB-250 (250 kg, 550 lb) bomb, after failing to hit its target twice on two previous attack runs. The explosion destroyed the aft 5-inch (127 mm) gun mount which was empty, as the 12-man crew having been evacuated following a \"hang fire\" (a round stuck in one of the barrels). Another MiG-17 simultaneously aimed its bombs at USS Oklahoma City but missed the target. According to U.S. claims, one of the MiGs was shot down by a Terrier surface-to-air missile from USS Sterett. One more MiG disappeared from Sterett's radar along with a Terrier missile fired at it from the frigate, indicating a probable kill. A North Vietnamese Styx anti-ship missile was alleged to have been fired and intercepted, but this was not confirmed by official documentation.At approximately 18:00 as the US ships withdrew to the northeast, USS Sterett detected two surface targets shadowing the US ships, after 30 minutes, Sterett opened fire on the targets with its 5-inch guns destroying the two suspected North Vietnamese P 6-class torpedo boats.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe North Vietnamese claimed the sortie involved two MiG-17s piloted by L\u00ea Xu\u00e2n D\u1ecb and Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n B\u1ea3y \"B\", of which all returned safely to their base, and that the North Vietnamese navy had not participated in any engagement until August 27. The attack crippled Higbee's 5-inch gun turret, impaired its steering and propulsion, and wounded 4 sailors on deck. Oklahoma City only sustained minor damage on its stern. The U.S. later responded by bombardment against Vinh and \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi on April 19 and 20, and an air strike by 33 aircraft on April 22 at the Khe G\u00e1t Airfield, from which the attacking MiG-17s had taken off, destroying one MiG and damaging another on the ground.Although the losses inflicted were superficial, the North Vietnamese attack had forced the Americans to employ more of their strength to prevent future incidents against the background of downscaling U.S. military activities in the area.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBoniface, Roger (2008).

          "While still busy with tourists, the market feels a little more friendly and natural than the rest of the desperately commercialised old town. It's a great place to try dumplings, pancakes etc and the squid looked good too. Only issue we had was a confusion with a drinks order",
          "This is quite a large covered market just outside the old town. Wide selection of cloth and the usual stuff you'd expect. Not as chaotic as similar places in HCM city. Not really my scene.",
          "The quaity and freshness of the dishes cooked on the street stalls in the covered market are amazing. We had a difficult time choosing our stall In the end it was Hoa Don Ban Le, and then the owner let us try a little of just about every dish on display. Amazing! We washed this",
          "In this market is where I had my best meal in whole Vietnam! The typical hoi an dish of Cao Lau is a must have!! I had it in the market for about 1 dollar and it was supreme!! You can't really leave hoi an without having Cao Lau!",

          "We decided to try the local noodle dish \"cau lau\" for lunch one day. We were a little nervous about getting sick, eating the local food, but decided to go for it. We chose a stall, they all seem similar. Ordered the cau lau. It had mainly rice noodles, some broth, pork, that",
          "We ate at the market in the food hall area and we went and bought dishes from different vendors, The Cao Lo was especially good and we ended up putting ourselves into a food coma we ate so much and i think we spent all of $25 for the whole meal for two! including drinks.",
          "You should know that there are two tiers of pricing. One for tourist and the lower one for locals. This applies to everything you buy or eat here n It's a good place for food but eaten in cramped quarters. We had tasty beef sinew noodles there. Stall holders tout for your",
          "Using both the local currency and USD can create a little confusion. That happened to me whilst enquiring about prices of goods in both currency! My trip to the local market did 'burn' a hole in my pocket as I overpaid for goods which would have cost a fraction. My advice is to",
          "We asked a local lady to recommend us a place in the market where to have a good cao lau (it was difficult to chose one among dozens of places). It was indeed excellent, one of the best dishes I tried in Vietnam!",

          "Mrs Diep cooks the best White Roses and Cao Lau - very friendly people, food is cooked in front of you and tastes delicious! We ate there a number of times over a week and had great experience. A cooling fan and a can of chilled drink were perfect with Mrs Diep's earthy food",

          "We visited Hoi An Market in two occasions, first time by ourselves and second time as part of a cooking class. It is fun browsing the vegetables and fruit stalls, as well as the dried goods. We managed to get some fruits, peppercorns, Cao Lau to take home etc from the Market.",

          "The markets at Hoi An are bustling and noisy - all the vendors want your attention and trade. The 'old' market is all produce and homewares, the 'new' market is all cloth, clothing and tailors. The markets also occupy the surrounding streets, selling souvenirs and other tourist",
          "I do not like markets but decided to walk through as we were in the vicinity.It was not so busy and the vendors did not hassle you to make a purchase.Of course we went to #Stall33 and met Mr My! of course there is no pressure to buy but he is full of compliments,witty and a good",
          "It may be basic and it's certainly cheap but the food stalls in the market offer perhaps the most authentic Vietnamese and local food in town. You can pay 200,000 vnd for a bowl of Cao l\u1ea7u at some of the restaurants overlooking the river or you can pay 20,000 vnd for the same",
          "We went fairly early in the morning (around 8:00) and the market was full of locals buying their groceries. The fish and produce market was especially interesting with many ladies selling their morning catch and fresh pickings from their garden. Worth a visit. We got some",
          "After eating at many high end and budget restaurants around Hoi An, our favorite dining experience is at Mrs Van's food stand inside the market. When we walked into the market, she gave us a big smile and asked how we were doing. We accepted the menu from her and boy are we glad",
          "You know those thrilling movie chase scenes where cars go screeching through the exotic, crowded market, scattering live squawking chickens and outraged locals in every direction? Hoi An Market would be a great setting for this. You've got your narrows rows of head-turning local",
          "I ate at the old market twice a day a lot of days, fresh food options are great, most meals around 30,000 Dong, great smoothies for 20,000 Dong, much cheaper than restaurants, and nice to fraternise with the locals.",
          "Usually I like to eat at different places while travelling, especially in foodloving Vietnam, but once I ate at Mrs Diep I just kept coming back. Whether it was lunch or dinner. The food, especially the local dishes, are excellent. Served to you by very friendly people. And",
          "We came here for lunch twice and ate the most delicious Quang nam noodles and pho ga, that we decided to arrange a cooking class. Our kids love pho, so we thought it would be great to learn her recipe so we could make it back at home. Mrs Diep, her daughter and Huong were all so",
          "We went to the market today to grab some street food and strolled across this. Great good at great prices highly recommend the spring rolls and the Cao Lao. Cao Lao is so tasty. They are so kind & so chatty too. Thanks for the great food :)",
          "Located at beginning of Bach Dang street, next to the river. Popular with locals for their fresh vegetables and local produce. Like most local markets.",
          "We ate at No.47 two evenings. The owner does speak English which is obviously very helpful. Good range of items at low prices. The Banana Flower salad is really good as are the White Rose dumplings. Chop sticks and western cutlery available. We were also able to get cans of beer",
          "Absolutely beautiful and atmospheric place. One of these places where you get the most from walking the streets and soaking it all up and then wandering in to a local eatery or shop. Nice lit up at night and the Japanese bridge was beautiful. Tourists 'pay more'...well then",
          "Spent two days in Hoi An and really, really enjoyed wandering the antiquated streets, especially the food market that lined the central streets, starting on Bach Dang road. It wasn't a 'tourist' market but rather a collection of traditional Vietnamese vendors selling herbs,",
          "The usual rip off for tourists. Why do foreigners have to pay more for the same food and taking up the same space? We went with a local guide and she ended up in an argument over the price, she was surrounded by the market holders and the whole scene was disturbing. We had",

Lots of sliced pork, green leaves, lime, crunchy topping. Delicious!!! Going back to eat again in this place!",
          "A wonderfully cheap and delicious local experience for lunch. Located right next door to the food markets, we were able to park our bicycles out in the front amongst the tirade of motorbikes. A simple menu filled with local Viet and some Western foods. We had the cao lau,",

Known as the photographer that \u201ccaptures souls\u201d, he is recognized for his portraits of Vietnam, Cuba, Malaysia and India, and for his cultural preservation work. \nIn 2011, he launched The Precious Heritage project with the goal of increasing recognition of Vietnam's diverse tribes through stories examples of their craftsmanship, and large scale portraits of each group in their traditional clothing. The project explores the histories as well as the changing futures of the tribes as globalisation and development alter their homelands and subsequently their traditions.On January 1st 2017, R\u00e9hahn opened the Precious Heritage Art Gallery Museum with the goal of creating a single place to preserve the artifacts and costumes he\u2019d been given by the chiefs of many tribes as well as to share the portraits, stories and musical traditions of the ethnic groups. The museum is free to the public. \nR\u00e9hahn completed his primary mission of meeting all 54 officially recognized ethnic groups in September 2019 and continues his research to discover the numerous subgroups that are spread throughout the country. \n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2007, the artist travelled to Vietnam for the first time on a humanitarian mission with the French NGO Les Enfants du Vietnam. He explored the country and its culture and captured more than 50,000 photographs. In 2011, after several more trips, he decided to move to Vietnam and settled in the UNESCO Heritage town of Hoi An. It was there that he captured \"Hidden Smile\",  the photograph of Madame Xong, captain of a small tourist riverboat, which has since been published in more than 100 articles worldwide. In 2014, he chose this photograph for the cover of his first book, \u201cVietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts\u201d, a collection of 150 photographs depicting the diversity of the country. A bestseller in Vietnam, the book is now sold in 29 countries. \nThe photographer\u2019s work became known in France when the French travel TV program \u00c9chapp\u00e9es Belles (France 5), featured him in a documentary about Vietnam on June 15th, 2016. \nFollowing the success of his first book, R\u00e9hahn published \u201cVietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts, Volume II\u201d in 2015 and \u201cVietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts, Volume III\u201d in 2020. In addition to this series, he released two coffee table size editions - \u201cThe Collection, 10 Years of Photography\u201d (2018) and \u201c100 Iconic Portraits\u201d (2019)-  to showcase his photographic work in Cuba, Malaysia, South and Centra America, and the Indian subcontinent in addition to Vietnam. \n\n\n=== NOTABLE PHOTOGRAPHS ===\n\u201cBest Friends\u201d Taken in 2014, this photograph depicts Kim Luan, a 6-year-old M'nong girl, praying in front of an elephant. Thanks to the press agency Caters in New York, the picture has been published in more than 25 countries and made the cover of magazines such as Conde Nast Traveler, The Times and National Geographic.\n\"Hidden Smile\"  - The portrait of Madame Xong was chosen to officially enter the permanent collection of the Vietnamese Women's Museum in Hanoi. In March 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron was presented with a limited edition copy of the portrait, to commemorate 45 years of diplomatic relations between France and Vietnam.In 2015, the photographs \u201cBest Friends\u201d and \u201cHidden Smile\u201d became part of the collection at the Asian House Museum in Havana, Cuba, as a result of the exhibition \u00ab Valiosa Herencia \u00bb (Precious Heritage).\n\u201cAn Phuoc\u201d -  This photograph has been featured in numerous Vietnamese publications, as well as international media such as National Geographic, BBC, Business Insider, Independent UK and the covers of Globe-Trotters and Geo magazine in France.\n\n\n=== HONORS ===\nIn December 2014, R\u00e9hahn was ranked 4th of the top 10 best travel photographers in the world by the website boredpanda.com.  This article was translated into more than 20 languages.\nJanuary 2016, he was ranked the second most popular French photographer on the internet by French website lense.fr.\nMarch 2018, the artist was honored during an official ceremony to commemorate 45 years of diplomatic relations between France and Vietnam when Vietnam\u2019s Secretary of the Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, who has since become President of Vietnam, presented French President Emmanuel Macron with a limited edition copy of the portrait \u201cHidden Smile.\u201d \nThe same month, R\u00e9hahn was awarded the 2018 Trophy for French Nationals Abroad by the French information website \u201clepetitjournal.com.\u201d\n\n\n== The Precious Heritage Project ==\nIn 2013, while travelling to meet the tribes of northern Vietnam, R\u00e9hahn witnessed not only the diversity and the rich culture of these groups but also the fragility of their heritage.  Traditional costumes, dialects, rites and ancestral knowledge are fading or being replaced by other methods as the country\u2019s development increases. R\u00e9hahn started to collect traditional costumes generally offered by the chief of the village themselves in order to preserve and present their culture.\nOn 1 January 2017, he opened the Precious Heritage Art Gallery Museum. Created to foster intellectual curiosity and open the doors to understanding and communication with the diverse ethnicities present in Vietnam, the museum attracts both tourists and locals. Within 500 m2, this cultural art space showcases more than 200 photographs of members from each group in their traditional dress. Displayed alongside the photographs are more than 65 authentic tribal costumes, some of them were given by the village chief as a means of preservation since many of these garments are no longer being made. Each ethnic group is presented with factual information and the stories of R\u00e9hahn\u2019s encounter with the tribe. The texts are available in English, French and Vietnamese.In September 2019, R\u00e9hahn completed his primary mission of researching, meeting, and documenting each of the 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== PUBLICATIONS ===\nVIETNAM, MOSAIC OF CONTRASTS -  VOLUME I  - January 2014 (ISBN 978-604-936-436-5)\nVIETNAM, MOSAIC OF CONTRASTS - VOLUME II  - November 2015 (ISBN 978-604-86-9307-7)\nVIETNAM, MOSAIC OF CONTRASTS, VOLUME III  - February 2020 \nTHE COLLECTION, 10 YEARS OF PHOTOGRAPHY  - December 2018\n100 ICONIC PORTRAITS  - November 2019\n\n\n== The Giving Back Project ==\nThe Giving Back Project is a way for \u201cthe artist [to take] on social responsibility by giving back to those who inspired the image. With this philosophy of \u201cconscious photography\u201d, both the subject and the artist benefit.\u201dThe project started with Madam Xong. Her portrait was featured on the cover of the photographer\u2019s first book - Vietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts, Volume I and garnered international press attention.  As a gesture of gratitude, the artist asked Madame Xong what she wished for the most. She requested a new rowboat so that she could be proud to ferry tourists around the city.  \nIn addition to supporting the personal needs of his subjects in the form of support for medical, educational and livelihood essentials, The Giving Back Project also aims to improve the long term living conditions of entire communities through education initiatives. \nIn September 2018, the BBC published an article featuring the artist\u2019s portrait of \u201cAn Phuoc\u201d  entitled \u201cThe Photos that Change Lives.\u201d The article gives details about R\u00e9hahn\u2019s Giving Back Project alongside initiatives of other photographers such as Ami Vitale and Kenro Izu \u201cwhose commitment to their subjects goes far beyond sharing their photographic stories.\u201d\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/travel/what-to-do-in-hoi-an-vietnam.html\nhttp://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20190613-the-many-faces-of-vietnam\nhttp://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180910-the-photos-that-change-lives September 2018\nhttps://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2159781/haunting-portraits-vietnams-disappearing-tribes September 2018\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/vietnams-voelker-beten-mit-elefant-fotostrecke-163616.html September 2018\nhttps://www.wanderlust.co.uk/content/photo-gallery-faces-around-the-world-rehahn-vietnam-cuba-india/ September 2018\nhttps://www.scotsman.com/news/french-photographer-rehahn-on-the-secret-of-taking-an-evocative-image-1-4782803 September 2018\nhttps://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2018/08/28/vietnam-portrait-rehahn-precious-heritage/ September 2018\nThe Precious Heritage Art Gallery Museum\n\"Official website of R\u00e9hahn\"\n\"Vietnam door de ogen van een insider\" , National Geographic, 10 March 2015\n\"Vi\u1ec7t Nam trong m\u1eaft nhi\u1ebfp \u1ea3nh gia Ph\u00e1p\", BBC, Vietnam, 15 June 2015.\n\"The People Behind the Places: Adventures in Vietnam\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, 1 December 2014.\n\"French artist puts on photo exhibition\", The Saigon Times, 3 March 2015\n\"Sguardi e sorrisi del Vietnam: il meraviglioso mosaico di Rehahn\", Repubblica, 16 March 2015\n[1]",

The hall used to serve as a meeting place for mandarins of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty (1802\u20131945) in Tet (the Lunar New Year) and traditional festivals.\nThe present reconstructed Nam Ch\u00e2u H\u1ed9i Qu\u00e1n is situated between the palace of princess Di\u00ean Ph\u01b0\u1edbc (1824\u20131848) and the temple of \u0110\u1ee9c Qu\u1ed1c C\u00f4ng, dedicated to Grand Duke vi:Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u0103ng H\u01b0ng, the maternal grandfather of King T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c (1848\u20131883). The king's mother contributed a great deal to the development of the hall. As time passed by, the hall was severely damaged by wars and harsh climatic conditions.\nHu\u1ebf Tourism Company has invested to develop the hall into a tourist destination in the tourism-culinary-culture zone. Here, tourists can rest, enjoy traditional foods made for festivals and for local residents' daily life, and explore local arts and culture. Nam Ch\u00e2u H\u1ed9i Qu\u00e1n also serves as a connection place for cultural-historical tourist trips, living-art tourist trips, eco-tourist trips, and trips to visit garden houses, ancient houses, and palaces in Kim Long Ward.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://svv.vn/namchauhoiquan Homepage",

          "Definitely better than the Japanese bridge temple (waste of time) and one of the prettier, less trafficked site in Hoi an.",
          "We visited this attraction as one of five using the Hoi An Attraction Pass. The temple itself is not that large but the architecture is what strikes you most, along with the bonsai garden. We entered expecting someone to take the ticket but we had to look for them. Shortly",
          "This town has many temples and this one was very interesting and worth a visit. It is located right in the town and easy to access while browsing around the shops.",
          "Calm and smallish temple. Beware of the many tailor touts just outside the temple. There are 3 temples along this road, this one is the nearest to the Cho Hoi An (or Hoi an market).",

          "It was raining heavily when I was hiding in Central Market. It was only after a really long time when I finally noticed this temple opposite and decided to use up one of my multi tickets for this. I wasn't disappointed. The rain and dark skies just accentuated the deep dark",
          "This is a beautiful and quiet temple, great architecture! It was built in 1653 when the city had many Chinese marchants. The place should need someone here to tell more about its history for tourist.",
          "A quaint house that is worth visiting if you're in the neighbourhood for a quick photo. I wouldn't plan an individual trip around it.",
          "This is another interesting temple in the heritage area, Hire a guide and many of the signs are not in English and it will make your visit more informative. Impressive and worth a visit.",
          "The tour guides here will help you learn about the history of this place, although they may also push you to buy gifts too. An interesting place, no doubt, though.",
          "One of the more impressive temples in the old city of Hoi An. Is set a bit back from the street with a fantastic tiled courtyard.",
          "The temple looked good from the outside and had an interesting muesem expect some of the signs weren't in English. It was good to look at exepct a lot of sign were not in English and no one is offering to take questions",
          "Magnificent architecture. We had a brilliant guide who explained things very eloquently, and made everything sound very interesting",
          "The architecture, the flora and fauna and the peaceful atmosphere. The location of the temple itself is a statement of the culture of Vietnam. In the middle of the busy square stands a quiet, peaceful and religious place for worship and solace.",

          "Same same but different. All the temple in the old town are pretty much the same. They may have some features that are not the same but overall they are identical. Learn about the history of each one and talk to locals before the visit they have great information for each one.",
          "Well we thought we would give it a go, how wrong we were. Firstly there is nothing wrong with what's on offer to see, small but interesting but for the grumpy old Toad that could not be bothered even to come and see or tickets, let alone cut the part of the ticket he needed to",
          "We had a quick tour of the temple which is actually quite pretty on the outside with the pink bricks. Our guide pointed out the carp-shaped rain spouts on the roof surrounding the courtyard and told us that he carp is a symbol of patience in Chinese mythology and is popular in",
          "We ended up in this temple as we thought it was another nearby, and both were pretty disappointing. Inside there were a few interesting statues but on the whole it was like the other temples. It was free to enter, so not so bad.",
          "There is a beautiful courtyard in the front of the temple. Inside a large table and paintings, plus the statutes. Take a close look. Worth the visit.",
          "The best part is the intricate dragon sculpture in a pond. The temple has great pictures sculptures and the architecture very interesting. You may get hit up for an extra ticket charge despite having an ancient city ticket. Be sure to visit at least one temple and this is one of",
          "External entrance to the Temple was very impressive. Inside it was the same buddha statues as the others I had seen.",

          "This temple is lovely. So beautifully decorated, and the artwork in stone, china and porcelain sculptures, etc. is magnificent. The garden is a piece of art in itself, and a lovely place to get off the streets, and enjoy some serenity. Worth the visit.",
          "This one was a bit different in that it had large incense coils hanging from the ceiling. Need a local guide to explain the significance of the various shrines, artefacts and rooms.",
          "Most temples look alike. This one is no different. Perhaps the flower garden at the back is the only thing that makes this temple different.",
          "This temple founded in 1653 is one of several in Hoi An - it was apparently originally frequented by visiting merchants who wished to pay respects to their ancestors. The interior was quite tranquil with a very lovely fish pool/bonsai combination that complemented this well",
          "like the other temples! same godess! same dragon foutain!same decor! nothing especial to see! i start to have allergy against the incess smell!",

          "This temple has been nicely restored and preserved and it shows you a very nice walk into the past. Very nice for your picture collection",
          "The bridge itself is amazing. I would also recommend seeing it from the river point of view. You can hire a small boat to row you along the river right past the bridge which make s for a better photo.",
          "We only saw this from the outside and it seemed fairly small. With limited time we visited some of the others but this one looked pretty attractive and compact. Attractive colours and I understand this was built in the 17th century. It certainly fits well within the ancient town",
          "Quan Kong Temple is located at 168 Tran Phu St. The Temple was constructed in 1653 & named after a Chinese general from the Han Dynasty who celebrated numerous military victories. The entrance fee is by the tourist ticket. The Temple has been lovingly restored & preserved",
          "Just average at best to be honest. From the choices of attractions with the old city ticket, I wouldn't strongly advise choosing this one, but they all seemed to be similar.",
          "A compact temple dating as far back at 1653. It has a lovely courtyard with a rock garden, nice plants and a pond stocked with turtles and fish. Behind this are cases containing two generals staring at each other and a couple of white horse sculptures.",
          "One of the quirks of religion is to worship your ancestors and not any particular deity. The Quan Kong Temple in Hoi An, also known as Ong Pagoda, was built for the benefit of sea farers to worship their ancestors. The temple is reported to be over three hundred years old.",
          "You can pick a free map of the old town in many shops and restaurants and can find the location for many interesting sites such as this small temple.",
          "Fantastic example of religious culture in Vietnam. I was surprised to find out that Buddhism is not the #1 religion in Vietnam. The worship of your ancestors is. Must go here if just to see a 400 year old Frangipani tree.",
          "It was just ok nothing special . Quite small . They try to charge tourist a fee but we did not have to",
          "A nice place to relax walk around talk to the young priests A nice place to get some great photos, have some nice Bonsai plants",
          "This is one of the four temples we visited and worth the effort, a guide is helpful but also easy to do by yourself. Not a big area so easy to get around lovely smells as you pass through and not very busy most of the time.",
          "This Temple is small, but surprisingly serene.The inside boasts some neat art and 2 giant horse sculptures. There is also a large replica of a Junk boat and some sweet lanterns! This Temple is also free if you go as the sun is setting (it was when we went anyway)",
          "This temple is in one of the main streets, very pretty. You need to have purchased tickets to get in worth buying a set of tickets which get you into the main bits in town. In this temple be aware you quickly go through to museum so will cost second ticket. Very tranquil. Pretty",
          "This place struck me as very Chinese in style. As the festival of Tet was fast approaching, there were plenty of flowers and lanterns decorating the place. Tet is the Vietnamese word for Chinese New Year.The temple is over 200 years old and has been well preserved.",
          "Full of beautiful things from furniture to the hundred birds in the pylons. Very informative introduction to the heritage of the house and also the confusious cup",

          "In Hoi An, you can buy a ticket that is valid for five of the museums/old houses/churches/emporiums that line the old streets. Frankly, you don't need to spend your money on this if you have been to any other town with chinese houses in another city which was runnign a more",
          "To me,Hoi An as a UNESCO Heritage Site is akin to Sudan as a member of the UN Human Rights Commission. Neither reflects well on the organization conferring the distinction, but this is one place worth visiting if you happen to be passing by. It is named after a distinguished",
          "small normal chinese temple. Good to take a look and some photos that's all. It is quite along the way as it is situated on one of the main streets in Hoi An old town.",
          "It's clean, bright and the carvings and workmanship is really beautiful. Well kept and maintain through the course of a few centuries or so, a definite must see especially for the cultural-religious enthusiasts.",
          "The monk did not let us in. We were in shorts and t-shirt and that was not appropriate, which is absolutely ok. So make sure to take long clothes if you want to visit the temple.",
          "If this is your first temple in Hoi an, then everything is look very attractive. After visiting several temples, then the excitement decline. Except, if you are enthusiast in learning the detail history of each temple. The gate, the front yard, the temple. But comparing each",
          "After giving up two tickets we went straight through this temple thinking there was something inside. It turned out we entered a museum through a small courtyard loosing another two tickets. A lady sitting at a counter purposely didn't stop us & demanded tickets upon exiting.",
          "Well worth the visit and some fantastic photo's can be obtained, the history of the Temple is fascinating and very interesting, the items on display make it even more interesting",
          "No doubt that wealthy patrons are supporting this temple. It is richly decorated and has significant gold plated items on show.",
          "There are many temples to see in Vietnam and after awhile they start looking the same. This is another beautiful temple, the difference is this one was built in 1653 when the city had many Chinese merchants. It comes under the Heritage ticket where you can see any 5 sites,",
          "nothing really too fantastic, or maybe i am jaded from the many temples im seeing around vietnam and also southeast asia.",

          "Beautiful park, we went there for the Hoi An Memories show and loving both the park and the show. The bubble tea shop needs better service though. After taking orders, a seem-to-be-new employee put a bunch of cups together. Ppl ordered first ended up having their drinks last and",
          "This is definitely a must see show. It is totally spectacular from start to finish. Breathtaking beyond description. Totally professional. Try to get there around 6.00pm as there's a lot more to see and eat before the show at 7.30.",
          "Wonderful! Great effort! We were so impressed by all the scenes. Music was so great! We loved that! Highly recommend!",
          "We had a short vacation in Hoian this Luna Tet 2020. We visited the Hoi An Impression Theme park on 29/1 and have watched the Live Performance \u201c Hoian memories \u201c. We enjoyed an old town space with full of cultural depth. All the content is reproduced very honestly, the most",
          "This is a minimum of a two visit experience. You can have a great time just viewing all the mini shows from 5 pm till7 pm, then have a meal. The main show is spectacular and a must see for a complete understanding of hoi an. We have long stayed in Hoi An three times over",
          "Excellent show! The light, dance and music was wonderful, it is the best show I\u2019ve ever seen. Highly recommended.",
          "Could not say how much I love this show. It was much more wonderful than I had expected. I don't even need the subtitle to understand the show. Just let the music touches your heart. I must say \"Hoi An Memories\" was a masterpiece that you should not miss. Worthy experience!",
          "The show have 5 sences which show the history of Hoi An. With more than 300 actors, the show leads us from \u201csurprise\u201d to \u201cdelight\u201d. Definitely a must-see show in Hoi An",
          "Excellent show. This is the first time we came to here. I\u2019m really impressive about 5 scenes. Surely coming back",
          "Highly talented performers and impressive pyrotechnics deliver an authentic flaviour of traditional Vietnamese traditions and cultural practices. Situated along the beautiful riverside on Hen Island, this is a show not to be missed. Shows run every evening throughout an",
          "Joy from Hoi An Central Boutique Hotel recommended this spectacular show. This is a masterpiece with so many people taking part. I would suggest if you have some time, please go and see the show and the theme park. Aim to get there as early as possible. Around 5-30 pm. You will",
          "We went to the Memories show and spent some time in the park before the show. Unfortunately all the restaurants were booked for some VIP visit and we could not find a place to have a decent meal, but the park was nice and the people there very friendly. Lots of mini shows and",
          "It\u2019s not only a theme park. It\u2019s a place that the people show their hospitality. Many small interesting shows before the main show. You could enjoy many famous local food in the theme area.",
          "I'll start by saying that the theme park, mini-shows, and main show are all excellent. Quite impressive. I would give this 5 stars. Unfortunately, it was undermined by what I feel was terrible service and treatment in their ticket booth. I purchased 4 full price tickets",
          "We went to see the impression theme park it was fantastic. All the personal were great they are kind and showed us all the places to visit in the park. Thanks to this park we could understand more about Hoi an culture.",
          "We booked tickets on the recommendation of a local. Expensive by normal standards: there are 3 price bands; the cheapest are actually nearer the action but uncovered, the most expensive VIP seats are at the top and were upholstered with arm rests; we chose the middle price (750k",
          "It was a very well done show with an amazing cast. It was very well choreographed but the text explaining the scenes were too fast and it was a bit hard to see. Overall a really amazing show.",
          "Great show and nice staff!! A must-see in Hoi An for both locals and foreigners!! Highly recommend !",
          "The show is visually stunning , the music and choreography is excellent too . Some of the costumes were unusual, I\u2019m not sure that the Romans ever went to Vietnam . A more literal translation of the story in the commentary would have made it more accessible. The rather poetic \u201c",
          "Very nice theme park and excellent show! Very impressed with the scale and effort the team have put into, worth a visit!",
          "Nothing so special and impressed..but good to see Ao Dai costume dancers... However some of Japanese lord are something wrong with recognition...acting and actions are all wrong...I think most of people thought it if Japanese..",
          "Reuters highlighted this show as the best in the world so I definitely wanted to see it. And it's worth every penny. The show is performed by almost 500 artists, with amazing contents, music and effects. The added value is all the mini-shows in the theme park which you can watch",
          "This theme park and show makes Vietnam proud. Of course you can't really compare this to Broadway or Disneyland - but it comes pretty pretty close. It puts much of Asia to shame to see a park and show of this quality. Theme park opens from 5pm onwards. Go as early as you can",
          "The best show I ever have seen in my life. The great companion of performance acting, lighting and outdoor surround music!",
          "I visited Hoi An Impression theme park and enjoyed the show on Dec 25 with my mom and this is absolutely the must-try destination when you are in Hoi An. The theme park opens from 5PM with lots of interesting mini shows with the warm welcome and instructions of all staffs and",
          "We saw the place from across the bridge and wanted to check it out as we had never been there before. Its quite late around 8/8.30 but we thought it would be fine to just drive there and look around. When we arrived there, there\u2019s one staff shouted to us not to go there and",
          "The show is really beautiful, we would like to introduce this show to all of you. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude0d",
          "The show, stage and costumes were very very nice. Theme park not that big. Food and drinks reasonable priced. You are forbidden to use a camera, you can use your mobile phone but it seems that it's forbidden to film. No need to buy vip tickets, we had the cheapest 600 k and no",
          "The show was majestic and simply spectacular. It was a simple, yet mind blowing show. The performance is definitely worth watching at least once, though you can also watch the mini shows happening throughout the park as well.",

          "We are no theatre or art critics and would rather poke needles in our eyes than going to the theatre in London. This show though however was spectacular and very well organised with regards to transport back to Hoi An. The costumes and performance of the dancers were excellent",

          "Beautiful scences, good sounds and attractive contend. The staffs are friendly, always smile and helpful",
          "The theme park is well-decorated in traditional ways. You must arrive 2 hours earlier before the show time to enjoy the foods and mini shows performed in each part of the theme park. The main show was fabulously amazing, with all the lights and magic moves from the dancers. I",
          "2nd time coming here brought me such a wonderful and enjoyable moment. The show was so vivid and hard to forget. I hope i could come back and enjoy the show again. 5 star service.",

          "If you are in Hot An, this is a must see show. The actual show is in open space and performance and amount of effort gone in creating the show is amazing. Do not miss it. It is the must show and book ahead as you may not be able to get a seat some nights. go for the VIP seats.",
          "They have a wonderful show at night - lights, music, heritage story, hundreds of performers. Excellent!",
          "This show was very much a cultural production difficult to follow the story of each theme in the show. Impressive from the sheer number of participants, the lights & the music. We booked vip seats & were under cover with cushioned seat, small fruit player & small bottle of",

          "Another massive theme park, trying to recreate scenes and daily life of early Hoi An. There were short acts and games here and there. Yes, the remodeling of ancient buildings are quite impressive. Some how just feels something is lacking. The Japanese corner felt a bit strange",

          "very good show. the light music and staff very beautiful. minishow very good. i will recommend for my friend",

          "This theme park was truly something else. So much effort was put into the costumes, shows, dances, decoration etc. Everyone is very helpful and eager to please the guests. I was one of the lucky ones to get in free due to the trial season they had before opening their doors",
          "With the cast of 500 beautifully dressed actors, this awesome show of 1 hour and 15 minutes on a spectacular 25,000 m2 3D stage is a combination of entertainment and learning about the history of Hoi An, comprised of 5 stages (Life, Wedding, Lamp and Sea, Trading Port, Ao Dai),",
          "Never expected such a beautifully performed show to ever see like this one was. Beautifully performed and u just couldn\u2019t get your eyes off for the whole show. Even if u don\u2019t plan to stay in Hoi An. U should have a stop over to preview this beautifully performed play.",
          "We did not know quite what to expect when we purchased our tickets, but it turned out to be an amazing show. This is a new production for Hoi An, so there is not lots of information as of yet but I certainly recommend you look into it. Before the main performance there are",

          "I really enjoyed the experience here at the impressions show. Very engaging and multi faceted. Thank you",
          "Much higher prices are charged for tourists and in my opinion that\u2019s discrimination. For an eco ticket you have to pay twice as much as a tourist. in Europe you can be sued for this. The show was nice to see but we would understand better if the Vietnamese singing was subtitled.",
          "The show was very good, minus how also amazing. The lighting, music, performance very interesting. I will recommend for my friend",

          "We went here not really knowing what to expect. But wow what a show! Before the main show, you can walk around their theme park, although it's more of a cultural centre and its not a theme park. They have mini shows of traditional dance etc, shops, food and a great atmosphere.",

          "This is a well organized and executed show with a huge cast and an ever changing set. Well worth a visit for an entertaining evening out in Hoi An",
          "Having read previous reviews I'll just give a few hints. If your budget allows it, get the VIP tickets for the show.(At around A$60 it is about 1/3 the price of a similar show in Aus.) You get cushioned seats under cover with a side table for the complimentary fruit plate,",
          "Theme park is a bit of a stretch. It has 3 mini street food stalls, Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese. There is a big bamboo structured restaurant in the center with a good menu and upper terrace. There are numerous mini performances from 5pm until the start of the big memories",
          "I was absolutely impressed by the performance and the skill of the 1000 performers. The digital effects were outstanding, spellbinding. Bravo!",
          "Our boat ride across the river from the old quarter was the beginning of a very entertaining night. Had dinner at a BBQ place which was good. Then after a little walk around the complex we went to the show. The outdoor performance was very professional, creative and",
          "More activities this time before the main show. It was a good evening. Acts before main event were very good. Its at least 650000vnd to see show so not cheap in vn standards but a great evening. Drinks are substantially dearer too.",
          "Impressive show, beautifully performed. Costumes props and stage amazing to watch. Plenty of food stalls and entire theme park clean and well thought out. Must see!",
          "We booked VIP tickets for this show. The view was excellent. There is no doubt that the show is spectacular, from the set to the lighting and the co-ordinated choreography but we felt that we had already seen all the best bits of the show by watching the online trailer. We paid",
          "What an absolutely amazing show! The lights...the dancers/actors...the amazing costumes...the choreography...the music...the stage (beautuful sets and sooooo big!)....the history of Hoi An. WOW! A definite must see if you're visiting Hoi An. So glad I had the opportunity to see",

          "Very professional main show, which lasts about 1:15 mins. Huge cast in a great story about Hoi An and it's history. As it was our last night we did splash out for the VIP tickets, which while giving great service, and fantastic seats, was not essential. The higher you sit up,",
          "We had such a good time, the staff is very kind, helping you to find different mini show before the big one, the food is very good and not so expensive (and you can try local things) and the show ! Wow ! Performers are very good, we enjoyed the music, story, dances, costumes...",
          "I don't understand why I watched the show and cried a lot. The show was really spectacular and I got goosebumps. Hoi An's woman is wonderful, faithful and they are such amazing with great sound and light technology. I'll enjoy the show in the future again!",
          "I've been here after the Impression park. You have to buy seperate show ticket away from the fun park ticket. Seem they vary from 500.000 VND - 1Mil.. (hard to remember the cost) I love the art and contemporary shows a lot therefore no better chance to enjoy this since my last",
          "The main Hoi An Impressions show is quite spectacular and provides some, but limited, english explanation of the history of Hoi An. Take earplugs though because the music is excessively loud (my ears were ringing and I had a headache by the end). There were other smaller",

          "The theme park itself is very enjoyable and definitely worth a walk around. The food is cheap and good quality. The impressions evening show was incredible, beautiful, breathtaking, awe-inspiring, etc etc. I wish more people knew about it. Such a huge cast and brilliantly done",

          "It was a great show, really good. Performance, story, the light, all great. Just need more strict for the rule. Like no camera, no video, no flash. I saw a lot of people record it and sometime they even used flash, that was so disturbing. For the show itself, it was perfect!",
          "We went for the Hoi An Impressions performance and didn\u2019t spend much time in the theme park. We arrived at 6.30pm and saw one mini show before the Impressions show at 7.30. You can arrive at 5pm to see other mini performances and enjoy the theme park. A good area for kids to",
          "This is a must-see, not only in Hoi An but you have to visit it once when you are in Vietnam. Can't express my emotion, breathless show!",

          "I saw similar show in China , and this one in Hoian is so very much superior. I was totally impressed with the way they displayed the beautiful culture of Vietnam. Many 100 of artists who did a fantastic job , with full credit to those who planned and presented this show. After",
          "Hoi An Impression can be broken down into two parts: the Theme Park which is actually free to visit, and the Impression Show which starts around 7:00 pm. The Theme Park is very well constructed and is separated into different historical segments/themes and each theme also",
          "Nice looking place, clean and proper that -in my opinion - lacks authenticity. Not at all my cup of tea. I would only recommend it if you have small children and you need a break from the busy Vietnamese life.",

          "Gate 1 Tours arranged this enjoyable trip up the Thu Bon River by boat, to Kim Bon Village from Hoi An. Numerous local craftsmen & artisans sell their carvings and wares from within their working studios. Here I located well-made items to bring home for gifts and for myself.",
          "We visited as part of a bike tour and would recommend this is the way to go with a guide explaining what was going on and visiting some of the artisans. I don't think you would get much out of it on your own. Interesting place to see the crafts.",
          "I visited here while on a half-day boat ride on the Thu Bon River. We stopped at a boat yard and saw ship-building that was quite interesting because of the craft involved and the approaches they were using to construct the boats. We also saw young men learning to carve and",
          "You can take a boat here from Hoi An hotel up the river. Interesting local shops, houses, and food market. Just walk around and enjoy the countryside.",
          "We went there and the place was tiny. Or at least the carpentry attraction area. We walked thru and the 1st shop keeper was super friendly. He invited us and let us do some amateur carving on small wood block. He showed his work and told us how long it takes to make a sculpture.",
          "You can wander in and out of the different shops/work areas and actually watch the artisans as work. It was so interesting to see all of the intricate detail in the carving and to see the different steps they take to create their masterpieces. You can also buy right there from",
          "Could take a boat trip to Kim Bong, a hidden village where people so creative and artistic with their handiwork",
          "we did a tour that included the pottery place and kim bong village ...enjoyed our stop at the pottery place but the boys thoroughly enjoyed climbing around the boats being built ...our guide translated for them if there was a language problem but they spent about an hour looking",
          "A stop on the riverboat trip. They mainly do carpentry work in the village including boat repairs. The market was the best thing to see.",
          "We took a leisurely tour up the Thu Bon River to see the Kim Bong village. For myself, the riverboat trip was better than the village tour. On the riverboat trip, we passed by a lot of tourist housing, but also past local fisherman, and they did part of their fishing with a",
          "The villagers do boat-building and refurbishment, as well as carvings, but they have also developed a side-business in selling tourist souvenirs. You can bargain, as not all of the wares are made at the village, so they also pay a supplier somewhere for the stuff they are",
          "Take the public ferry with your bike to Kim Bong. You can see the carpenters building boats. We also visited a rice noodle-cracker business as well as one of two families that hand weave straw mats.",
          "A lovely and peaceful interlude to see the crafts in action. Some beautiful items on sale as well at 20% less than in shops in Hoi An",
          "Just a 20 minutes boat ride across the Hoi An old town. It is a small place with a lot of carpenters producing a lot of small to large artifacts. There is also a small carpentry workshop producing beautiful artifacts out of embedded sea shells in wood. Visit it as a nice change",
          "There is no activity currently, two old dilapidated trawlers wait in the wharf for something to happen, same as me. No Craftsmen visible, two small wooden boats are worked on, by who I haven't seen.",
          "We walked from old town and none of the maps had a correct location for the village. Luckily the Vietnamese are all very friendly and willing to help. We went specifically to souvenir hunt and some strong bargaining later some happy tourists. Don't push the craftsmen and women",
          "If you google the bong carpenters village and look for directions you will discover a 35 minute magical walk from Hoi An, across the new iron Cam Lim foot and motorcycle bridge to unspoilt countryside and the village. It's a little confusing to find it, don't walk or cycle too",
          "This village was one of the five stops we have made on our Hoi An Free Tours (See separate review , highly recommended ) easy cycling journey from Hoi An to countryside . Very interesting place . and although a bit touristic , you can still appreciate the Vietnamese culture of",
          "This place needs a bit of TLC and sprucing up after the damage caused by the massive floods earlier this year that must have been devastating. Disappointed after our previous visit 2016",
          "Caught a boat over to this island not knowing what to expect. It was very quiet & hardly any tourists. Was able to watch carvers doing their work. Walked around the boat building yard. All very interesting & would visit again to spend more time exploring.",
          "We cycle from Hoi An to Cam Kim Island by passing the bridge, we did not take a ferry. It's fun cycling around to see the life of the local and the country side. Boat making and woodworking and sculpture are done here, we saw people actually doing the sculpture. There are",
          "Recommend visiting this village by bike ( put our bikes on a small boat to cross). Sleepy place with carpentry and boat constructions, very interesting to watch ( boats are considered part of the family, so they all have eyes drawn on them). They all sell some kind of souvenirs",
          "Don\u2019t bother. I was expecting craftsmen at work - saw two, but all very half hearted. The locals only wanted to sell you cheap carvings that are normally sold down the market.",
          "I stopped in here on a half day tour with Tommy Dao Tours with Mr Ken. We took a short boat tour & walked around the village watching the boat building, wood carving & the mother of pearl inlay being made. My guide was very informative & introduced me to the locals....you can",
          "Seems to cater for the tourist souvenir market with lots of cheaper items displayed in numerous similar shops.",
          "Very close to the Old town, with a 10 minute boat ride to get there. It was a bit muddy (rainy January season) but a great adventure with lots of crafts and it was great to see the boat building with handmade wooden nails. Vietnamese people are very ingenious and clever. We saw",
          "Lots of quiet paths all over the island -ideal cycling. We picked up Banh Mis each first for our lunch and purchased cold drinks at one of the cafes in Kim Bong village.",
          "We went by boat to Kim Bong Carpentry village. This was a very interesting place. Beautiful carvings and items the people make from wood. Also the boats they make, like in the old days. Also a good place to shop",
          "We rode with our tour guide Tommy from Tour of Hue - fantastic guide with lots of information . the locals are great - we visit a shipyard , a woodcarving place , a little market , a ricepaper making joint nad a straw mat weaving place . All are interesting for my boys . As for",
          "Kim Hong Village is on a small island close to Hoi An town. Best way to visit is by local bicycle tour. Lots of village skills including an 80 years old bamboo weaver, jute mat weavers, rice paper and White noodles cooking and skilled carpentry. Local cuisine of crispy rice",
          "This is a village / compound which specializes in just about anything to do with wood. The skilled artisans are carpenters and more. There are wood carvers, boat builders, joiners, marquetry makers and mother-of-pearl decorators. You\u2019ll enjoy.",
          "I visited the carpentry village 3 times over a period of 3 years. It used to be better than it us now. On the first visit there were many large scale constructions going on, (mainly fishing boats) but now the village is largely a group of shops selling souvenirs. Most of the",
          "During my time in Hoi An one of my most enjoyable moments was the morning we spent at Kim Bong. This was due to a combination of things including the ferry ride and the bike tour around the village! We started off with a very pleasant boat journey to the village, with some good",
          "Like many villages the industry of the people is admirable to say the least. While we found the few woodworking places very interesting and we admired the amazing skills of workers, we were surprised by the numerous other stores all selling a similar range of goods albeit with",
          "I visited this village at the end of my son tour. There are a lot of stores and people making handcraft. It was interesting to me to see watching people carving things on a piece of wood. However the carvings are kind of expensive.",
          "This village is only accessible by boat as it's on an island however that is part of the experience. We enjoyed watching the men at work using basic tools which brought back memories of when my father built boats and made masts over 40 years ago. Some of their methods were",
          "Yes there is a long time spent on some of these carvings but they appeal to a limited group or those who put them in a draw to never be seen again",
          "This is an interesting island. Well worth a visit if you like seeing artisans and tradesmen at work. It has it's own market and you can buy gifts there.",
          "My boat took us there after our cooking class and we only spend 30 mins walking and seeing. dont waste time there.",
          "I went to Kim Bong Carpentry Village as part of a cycle one way come back by boat return to Hoian. The experience is designed with tourists in mind and during my visit I got to make rice noodles, weave a portion of a sleeping mat visit a temple and a home and see some carpentry.",
          "I think we were a bit unlucky to visit on a National Holiday so hardly any craftspeople were on site. We had to content ourselves with a quick look around a workshop and the boat building yard. Not a highlight of our tour!",
          "Was in one of the places to visit in our cycling tours. Have to take a boat to go to this carpentry village. We bought the small soveniour vietamese boxes and coasters in there and learnt that we can get it cheaper in the old town after. So not reccomended to buy things here.",
          "One of our most memorable days in Vietnam was when we visited Kim Bong village, but what made it special, was not the carpentry village itself, but biking around Cam Kim island. It's easy accesible though a bridge (no cars allowed), after the bridge, Kim Bong village is to the",
          "Ok for an hour or so. The prices for the actual carvings were outrageously expensive compared to other places we have been to in Asia (yes whey also make by hand). Trinkets etc are cheap enough but you can get them anywhere.",
          "We went to Huynh Ri whose family were one of the founders of this carpentry village. They start carving at the age of 5! This is not just a place to buy trinkets that can be brought anywhere as one reviewer described. This is a village rich in culture and talent. We did purchase",
          "We booked a boat tour from our Hotel at the river to the pottery and carpentry village. While there were interesting views of performing artists at the pottery village that was much more diffcult to find in the carpentry village. Too much sales activity and too little insights.",
          "Nice break away form the town, can only be reached by boat. We had lunch on the boat and then stopped to look at the small market in the village. Very talented carpenters.",
          "Our Thu Bon River cruise took us through fishing areas on streams and main river where we witnessed how fishermen cast their nets. Our boat trip made a stop at Kim Bong village where they specialize in boat building, repair and furniture making. Here we toured a wood working",
          "My wife and I visited the Kim Bong Carpentry Village as part of our organized tour of Vietnam. It was an add-on tour that I was glad to have selected. It began with a leisurely boat ride on the Thu Bon River. We knew we were close when we began to see the boats in dry dock",
          "There are two ways to see the Kim Bong Carpentry Village: an organized tour or on your own. I preferred going on my own with a bicycle from my hotel and a few bucks to one of the boat operators to take me across the water. The area around the docks in the carpentry village is",
          "So glad that I came here with Hoi an free tours as our guide was great at explaining the whole process of how the boats are made. These boats are amazing when you see the very traditional and basic method they are built.",
          "Seeing the skilful work in carpentry makes one marvel at the Vietnamese innovation in boatbuilding and delicate carpentry work.",
          "Ignore the group tours, if you are able to, hire scooters and enjoy the trip getting to carpentry village your own way it's a really nice quick ride through some pretty countryside. Once there get past the obligatory junk stalls (they all have to make a living and some of the",
          "Aside making boats, launches and the like out of wood, they also made many artefacts and statues and wooden containers, chop sticks, and many things were even lacquered! Apparently their biggest industry is the boat and ship building industry using wood as the raw material.",
          "We rode a bike to the area and enjoyed seeing the craftsmen at work. Don't forget to take an extended ride through the streets where the people live.",
          "Nice place if you have time to walk around the city. It is about 2 km from the ancient city. You can walk or ride there, but the way isn't something stunning. You'll find 2 or 3 very good carpentry shops. Items are almost the same you see in the city but more varied in sizes",
          "We visited this island and village on our own. We were dropped off at a walker's/motorcycle bridge by our taxi on La Hoi island (without having been told before that the taxi couldn't take us directly to the village). But luckily the weather was good and we enjoyed a walk to",
          "Yet another artisan village with lots of piled up carvings for sale, found prices to be same or higher than in the old town, nothing special",
          "A light trip after discovering My Son Sanctuary. It is fun to see the workmanship to carve all by hand and creat the beautiful things from wood and sell. We booked a joined trip with a raisonable price, and it is worthly for a full day visit in Hoi An. We never got bored each",
          "We visited Kim Bong carpentry village as part of a tour that included a boat cruise on the Thu Bon River. The village itself was pretty quiet and peaceful when we visited in early November. There were some woodworkers carving and they were fun to watch. I thought that the formal",
          "Unless your are interested on buying handicrafs it is not worth to waste your time, nothing to see but shops.",
          "Amazing to see handcrafted inlays of mother of pearl. But prices exhorbitant for mass produced items.",
          "We happened to visit it as part of our My Son Tour. We didn't attend any workshops, just walked around. It was interesting to see how they do the woodwork in an old school manner. It is not one of our particular interests so we didn't quite appreciate the skill behind it, but",
          "It was an interesting visit but lots of tourists go to the same place, so it becomes crowded at times. On this type of visit you see so much that looks the same from one area to the next. After a while, it all becomes too much.",
          "Brilliant day trip to pottery and wood carving. Went in speed boat with Vy as our tour guide. Vy was a very knowledgable and interesting guide. We weren't too see when we left but came back excited at what a good time we had had. Thank yo Vy",
          "We visited Kim Bong as part of a free bicycle tour with Hoi An Mates and it was so much fun. We went into the homes of locals and learned how they make sleeping mats and rice noodles. We also visited a family temple. This is such a fun ride from Hoi An and it's great to",
          "We visited the village as part of a tour with hoi an mates. We went to a shop where they sell many different and diverse carvings. Most are done in a local style and will interest people who like asian designs. At the side of the shop there were 5 young men who were all hand",
          "I enjoyed my visit so much the first time that I have come back 2 more times. It is a lovely tranquil Island and the Carpentry Village was the highlight.",
          "Great to see some of the local wood artists in action but not much else to it , everyone wants you to come to their shop ! . Nice walk but not much more",
          "We visited the village as part of a tour around Hoi An and I was sorry that we didn't get more time to meander around the little village. We saw some lovely craftmanship here and I would like to go back again.",
          "It was interesting to discover that much of the wooden products available for sale on the street are cheap imports from China. Here however craftspeople are still carving and creating wooden art from sculptures & mother of pearl inlays to entire boats by hand. You can watch the",
          "We visited the village as part of our bike tour from Rivertown hotel, just across the bridge. It was interesting to see the carvers at work and sad to think that there are very few young people taking on the craft, partly because of how little they are paid for their beautiful",
          "If it's included in some tour, it's nice to see the locals building the fishing boats. Rest of the village is nothing special, shops, shops and shops.",
          "Getting on the local ferry to go to this village is also part of the whole 'local' trip and a great way to be with the locals. The village itself is very interesting. A bike is a good idea though. The carpentry is amazing as they are all very talented. A much nicer way to shop",
          "Interesting to see how these artisans make wood objects from mother of pearl inlaid furniture to boats. Few would have one of these pieces shipped home.",
          "We visited this village on out day trip in Hoi An. This village has a beauty of countryside with bamboo, green field, river, cows,...and special famous for carpentry. We could see how the worker made a product with simple tools, so fast and good art.",
          "Good, but like everywhere in vietnam...a lot of merchendise that is alike to what they sell everywhere besides the beautiful woodwork",
          "Surprisingly visited here as a stop of Myson boat trip . Not very interesting unless u like woodwork craft very much",
          "Had a chance to visit this village while bike riding. Quiet village with amazing carpentry and boat constructions. People are veyr nice and you can get a glimpse of how people live in the countryside.",
          "He was much more stunned with my phone casing than I was stunned with his carpentry. My casing had lots of imitation gemstones and he thought that the phone casing was worth millions.",
          "Either a short 10 min ferry ride or on the end of a tour, we did the my son sanctuary first. If you like seeing people use real carving and carpentry skills from fishing boats to in laying shells etc, it is worth the look. An hour is plenty there. No hard sell, fair prices.",
          "Great Village. Mr Hung follow our group. More and more destination... boats, woods, handicraff, noodle, mat... rice fiels, templet, bamboo bridge... 7UP KIM BONG VILLAGE!!!",
          "We did the free bike tour which visited this village. We did lots of activities and everyone as very nice, especially the rice noodle lady. I was impressed when all the prices at the souvenir shop at the end were great prices compared to the prices of the shops in the old",
          "Visited the village, and the guide brought us into the carpenter workshop and see them working on the wood carvings, as well as selling alot of local souvenirs. Good to pick up some but quite pricey over there.",
          "Catch any one of the many boats chasing your business and take a trip over the Cam kim island to the carpentry village, and pick up some great wooden gifts the wooden toys are amazing and all beautifully made from mahogany.Or just watch as they work on the boats.",
          "Nice to see the craftsmen at work in various shops, but there was less to see than I had expected. Still a nice trip across by boat. The regular ferry leaves just before you reach the market, to the left of where the tourist boats try to tout you. We paid 50.000 dong for 2",
          "We came here to visit one of the carpentry shops and take a class. There are beautiful woodwork creations and it is interesting to learn the history of this island and woodworking in Vietnam.",
          "Very good sense of detailed work that the people here did with small utensils and implements. you want to buy everything!",
          "I was on the boat back after a disappointing tour from the MySon temples and was not expecting to get taken here. It's interesting and really cool to see them do the carvings but the prices are higher for everything and it feels like they took us there just to buy things. Can",
          "We took a taxi to Kim Bong Carpentry Village and got to see a bit of the landscape on the way. What a lovely little corner of the world. The crafts on display at the carpentry village are in a word amazing. The skill of the craftsmen is just magnificent. The amount of detail",
          "We enjoyed the short boat trip from Hoi An which was not expensive and came back with some pieces which will be a reminder of our lovely holiday in Vietnam. These were not expensive and we wished we had more room in the suitcase.",
          "We spend out first morning in Hoi An cycling along the peaceful lanes that criss-crossed the islands across the river from Hoi An town and Kim Bong Carpentry Village was one of them. There were many other crafts on view being performed by elderly folk who had perfected their",
          "Skilled woodcarvers and a lot of interesting things to see. Too bad that the suitcase did not fit any more purchases are also builders of wooden boats next door. Tour the island by boat or by bike is successful. t. E and P",
          "My tour guide brought me here to experience local cultures including boat building, crafts and noodle making. Very informative and a great chance to chat with locals and see how people make things by hand and not with heavy machinery. I was very impressed with the 2 homes I",
          "We went to this quaint little village by boat, fairly cheap to get any of the boats to take you across. It was great to see how they fix and build boats. We also got to see lots of wood working. Their were shots there that you could buy food and souvenirs from. Quiet",
          "We arrived by boat and it was interesting to see the boat buiders at work building and maintaining various boats using traditional methods. Then it was onto the rest of the village,to see various craftsmen working their magic on the wood with of course the option to buy their",
          "We reached this little village by boat on a beautiful, clear morning. The woodwork and inlay artistry is beautiful. We find it far more enjoyable to venture out of the cities to smaller villages to see more of daily life. The people are friendly and welcoming. The boat trip",
          "Jump on the bike ferry next bto the central markets across to Kim Bong and spend a few hours walking around. A new bridge has just opened to Kim Bong and its an easy pushbike ride over. i really enjoyed watching the tiniest pieces of mother of pearl being had cut.",
          "Our visit here was extremely interesting. Watching the carvers holding the wood between the feet while chiseling intricate designs was amazing. The gift shop had reasonable prices too.",
          "A short and very reasonably priced boat trip to the Carpentry Village will reward you with the opportunity to see and watch some beautifully hand crafted wooden artefacts being made. Also the chance to buy at give away prices.",
          "Our group of 15 took a local ferry over to the village. Watching the fishing boats being built was a real education as materials used and techniques are hundreds of years old. On to the carvers. How in the world do they hold the wood between their feet while they carve. There is",
          "We went with a free tour Hoi an mates. Didnt go in the shop but told cheaper than market. Watched the boat builders which was very interesting, quiet and peaceful.",
          "we use push bike to get here go over the bridge that only bikes and mopeds can use and turn left , you will see the boat builders on the left , thats it good for wooden gifts and cheaper than the market and shops",
          "It's nice to see these old traditions being kept alive. For example the man who whorks with the mother of pearl products, or the shipbuilding. Nice for a short visit.",
          "We visited this place and it was great to see some of the truly outstanding work carried out with such skill, sadly we did not purchase anything as we had run out of space in our luggage by then",
          "We caught a local boat across to the village, enjoyed the boat ride, paying much more then the locals. 50000VND return per person in comparison to 10000VND return for locals. However for us it was worth it. Lovely little village easy to walk around, lots of shops and workshops,",
          "they can create many things from wood , very good creativity , and they are the heritage conservation",
          "I visited this village as part of a day tour. We needed to take a boat ride to the village, as it is located on an island. Over here, I visited a few carpentry workshops and witnessed how the locals crafted the various wood carvings. As expected, there were shops selling hand",
          "The history of wood working is strong in this nearby village. Both intricate carvings and ship building are family businesses. Take the local ferry, not the tourist boat. Ride your bike, and visit the island. It is a good chance to visit a non-tourist area, on your own.",
          "Handy Craft and making boat are nice! You can enjoy here by bike. And you will how a thing were made from wood! love them",
          "Our bike driver took us here..across on the boat. The boat building was great to watch. We then continued on through the countryside. It's an old back in time village for us westerners.",
          "Visited this as part of our day trip to My Son. You get to go up close to the workers as the carve out a huge array of items. If you can think of it they can carve it! There are massive statutes, if that' your thing, but lots of smaller souvenir too. Not too pricey.",
          "A trip by boat gets you here, and that was fun, lots of boats in old town. The village is very nice, and the people actually do the work themselves so its all hand made. You can even buy a handmade boat, and paddle it back to America !",
          "You can visit some carvers and their shos who have been there for many generations.the boat building work shop where you can see how they use the wood to a tualy make the boats is very intersting.",

          "We walked through the village as part of a cycling tour, taking the ferry from the pier at Hoi An Ancient Town. Didn't stay long but their carving skills were top-notch. My guide said years ago a kind old man decided to teach young kids in the village wood-carving in order to",
          "We visited the carpentry village as part of a tour so there wasn't enough time to take in the finer details of the crafts people at work, some of the inlay work was exceptional and very interesting to watch being made. Well worth a visit but some more time is needed to",
          "We were interested in looking at wood carving in our recent stay in Hoi An but as the day was really hot we lacked some enthusiasm. Walking around Hoi An however we came across what we understand is a shopping outlet for Kim Bong Carpentry Village - ie Moc Truyen Thong Kim Bong,",
          "Went to this village on a bike tour and it was well worth the time and money. Seeing crafts men of all ages undertaking work that has been done for hundreds of years was inspiring and made me appreciate that these places need to be maintain to ensure the traditions of this",
          "This was an interesting village. It is quite commercial, as one would expect from a tourist destination. My favorite part was watching the boatbuilders.",

          "We had to travel by boat for 20min to get to this place. We are coming to a rural area of Hoi An. A peaceful countryside and beautiful. We visited the wood carving village. We are seeing the deft hands of the artisans here. They made wood products very fussy and refined.",
          "We came here after a day trip for only 30min It was ok and not more then that You see the locals make stuff, they want u to buy it- that is it",
          "Fun excursion to a small island across the river from the old town. We went solo, taking one of the ferries across the river, taking our scooter with us on the boat. It's kind of b.s. that they charge tourists way more than the locals to ride the ferry, but they did have to",
          "You will need to take a ferry here or go the long way round. Boat building ongoing and interesting to see. Shops sell smaller items. However, this trip only needs less than 1 hour.",
          "We went as a side trip tour visit to My Son. For usd $3 it was fine but not worth a separate trip. Was interesting to see the locals at work and to understand how high flooding can get.",
          "A really interesting place to see carpentry and fine details of many vietnamese souvenirs made. Take the boat over from the city of Hoi An. It should cost 20,000VND. If you get told more than that you will be done over. A lovely place to walk around to see boats being made,",
          "It's a nice little village. There's a few things to see such as boatbuilding and traditional carpentry. I went with hoi an free bicycle tours which were great and they support the village with donations. If you'd rather do it yourself though it I pretty easy. Get a bike and go",
          "This small boat-building community is set in a quiet backwater of Hoi An adjacent to the river, but it is well worth a visit to see the craftsmen skilfully creating intricate wooden sculptures of exceptional beauty and quality.",
          "We stopped here after a morning at the My Son ruins. Wish I would've spent more time here, we were kinda rushed through. Very Interesting to see the traditional boat building and carpentry that goes on here. You can see many of the tourist items that are sold in Hoi An are",

          "Can walk around this village. Get the regular ferry. Locals pay 4000VND for a one way trip but a fair tourist price is 10000 each. The walk to the \"eco farm\" is only 15-20 mins so don't need transport. The route is past the carpentry shops, local market, homes and school, then",

          "This was just a short visit for us on a whistle stop tour but it was nice to see the intricate carvings (with great detail) and cabinets that are made here. No modern machinery either, just basic hand tools and patience and skill. The variety of woods used are sourced locally",

          "From the tourist bustle and you are in the village where the range of local production continues in the shadow of the unesco protected town. It's not the human zoo of tourist villages yet. Real local production to a commercial level still exists. Wooden ship building is at",
          "A visit by boat to this village is pretty much always offered together with the tour to My Son. I found this to be a very mixed bag. Bottom line, if you have little time in Hoi An, skip this one, if you have plenty of time and want to add another destination to your scrap book",

          "I visited the Carpentry village in early November and was amazed at being able to view quality works being made by hand by such skilled craftmen. I get frustrated when tourists review such places as being commercial. Hello? What do you expect them to do, give away their work?",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "Each shop or cafe by itself is nice but on the whole it becomes overdone and now crowded with tourists so hard to walk. Would suggest at the most one night stay in Hoi An and do Old Town during the day. It may be hot but you will avoid the mass of tourists that come at night",

          "Hoi An lives up to its reputation. Loved walked the ancient streets in the day and night. Good food, historic sites and so much more. Visiting at night with the lights, lanterns and colorful boats is a great memory. I want ot return.",
          "We have been travelling round cambodia & Vietnam for a few weeks now..this is the best place I have been by a long mile...i love it here..the ancient town is the prettiest place i have ever been..if you cross over the bridge on the river we found it completely different..still",
          "A must visit if going to Vietnam. Hoi An perfectly captures the new and old in a wonderful and enchanting mix. Great sights, great restaurants, interesting coffee shops, wonderful tailors. Original Taste of Hoi An Food Tour is a must do.",
          "Back again after a visit last year. Yes, it's touristy but the people go to a great effort to make you welcome everywhere. It still has a lot of character. And the prices are so reasonable. Remember when they approach you to buy something they are just trying to make a living.",
          "Everyone knows that a trip to Vietnam isn't complete without a visit to the very beautiful and unique city of Hoi An. Some people, curiously, just do a day or overnight trip here but we found that 4 nights was just perfect to explore it both on bicyle and foot. Be sure and see",
          "Love this place, you need to experience it during the day, & night as it is completely different. It comes more alive at night with all the lantern boats, night markets, & no vehicles. It is an experience being out on a one boat lantern, & a full lantern boat, as they go in",
          "Should be lovely but the old town is just a long procession of shops and constant harassment. There are some interesting corners of the town but overcrowded and depressing.",
          "In the evening it was pretty, but it was VERY crowded... only tourist, not a very genuin feeling. But it was pretty to see one night (one time) but would not go back. The best thing was to walk around the river after all the people had put down the small lanterns in the water",
          "We didn't follow any tour, I read a load about the town before going. First, we went to the Hoi An Office of Tourist Services to purchase our entrance ticket to some world heritage old houses, museums and ancient temples. One entrance ticket allows you to visit five places in",
          "This place is absolutely stunning as soon as you step in, beautiful lanterns all over the place, amazing food options. The whole walk is mesmerising to say the least! Can\u2019t get enough of it. We actually extended our stay in Hoi An to keep coming back to the ancient town.",
          "Ancient town is super busy but so good. We came here two years ago and it wasn\u2019t that busy, this time it was out of control but still has character and is an awesome town to visit. The bars, restaurants and shops are all very good. Love the lanterns and can\u2019t wait to go back in",
          "Words cannot describe Hoi An. You must experience it for yourself. Walking through the streets is like being in a fairytale.",
          "We really enjoyed walking through the old town (especially when there were no scooters). If you take the ticket to visit it, you can go to up to five monuments and I would recommend those ones: Phuoc Kien Hoi, Quang Dong, house Phung Hung, house Tan Ky and house Tran. To cross",
          "What a beautiful place to visit! You feel as though you are back in time with the many colorful lanterns all lit at night...the most beautiful time to visit. Seeing the lanterns and candles floating on the river was breathtaking. Loved all the ancient architecture and buildings",
          "Stunning town with superb ambience. Great food, great people and great value for money. Walking around is safe and enjoyable with so much on offer from tailor made goods to artwork and souvenirs",
          "After spending a few weeks in Vietnam over December 2019 / January 2020, I can say that Hoi An was definitely my favourite spot. Great to explore during the day to see all the landmarks, and equally cool at night with all the laterns lit up. The only negative thing to be aware",
          "One of the best quaint little towns I've visited... Beautiful place full of life. The local population is extremely talented in all kinds of handicrafts. Extremely polite & friendly people... The town had preserved their culture & heritage. Their expertise less in making high",
          "The town is very pretty with many bars and restaurants. Would also recommend a ride on a lantern boat - it\u2019s very romantic and supports the locals. Just be careful not to flash your wallet/purse as it can get crowded after sunset and there can be pickpockets around.",
          "I have travelled many places in Asia and I would say Hoi An is one of the most enjoyable cities I have been too. So many happy friendly people. Highly recommend.",
          "We spent 5 nights in Hoi An, ostensibly to see the historic buildings and visit My Son. We found the city to be exceptionally touristy, with the historic buildings hidden amongst the shops and 3/4 nights would have been enough. Lots of people are trying to make a dong or two,",
          "We spent 3 nights in Hoi An, and wandered the streets of ancient town every night. Several streets are mainly walking streets, with just a handful of motorbikes, making for a much calmer walk. Lots of restaurants, shops, bars, etc. For sure, most of the shopping is leather,",
          "I think this must just be the prettiest city I have ever seen. It is a UNESCO world heritage site and the minute you step in, you feel like you have gone back in time and stepped in the Vietnam of 17th-8th century. The houses have been well preserved and now being used as shops",
          "Really nice place to look at and I imagine once it was just delightful. But it's really just so tiresome to have to dodge the people constantly shouting at you trying to scam you. The fruit women are the worst, literally witnesses several people paying $5 for one small banana!",
          "Stayed in Hoi An for 12 days October 2019 loved every day I was here,you can walk or ride bike into ancient town from your resort or catch taxi for around 50,000 vnd.Visit the many restaurants and shops in Ancient town.",
          "Beautiful place... cruising, fresh food, time to relax, kayaking, visiting the caves, so much charm and character.",
          "We often go here by motorbike. During the day wandering around and eat streetfood. After 17h streetlights goes on and is do romantic to see. Better to stay here overnight so you do not miss anything",
          "Don't get lost in the markets and be prepared to see and smell a special atmosphere. The traffic is a challenge but at the same time fascinating. Very friendly people.",
          "Hoi An ancient town is bustling, hectic, manic and very hot. It's a must-see for any tourist, but expect to be hassled at every opportunity by locals trying to sell their wares and tours. I'm not criticising as they're trying to make a living, but it's something to be aware",
          "Hoi An a town like I had never seen before. Amazing history, buildings that have survived wars, and a magical atmosphere at night with all the lanterns decorating the streets and boats. There is the shopping and hundreds of tailors ready to make suits/ dresses and reasonable",
          "I liked this town quite a bit. It was festive and quite pretty at night. It is also a large shopping mall but you can get bespoke clothes made.",
          "I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve visited Hoi An. Maybe this is visit number 5! I\u2019ve just enjoyed 10 days - relaxing, cycling, visiting my favourite tailor and enjoying the delightful food. Last visit I discovered Autumn, at La Vangs tailor in Cu Dai street. She has",
          "I love the Old Quarter for its charm, quaint and as if time stood still and traveling back in time cycling and walking around the lanes and shops. Very relaxing sipping a Vietnamese coffee watching the wold go by and visiting much of the heritage buildings. My second visit and",
          "When we visited during end-of-year holidays 2019-2020, there seemed to be more tourists than locals in the streets. There is a ridiculous amount of random silly stuff for tourists to buy. The buildings are very well preserved and curious to visit. Beware most of the \u2018assembly",
          "At the Hoi An Hotel...I have the satisfaction to learn some topical dishes and to visit a farm to learn and see the way the vegetables are planting and harvested. I have the pleasure to expend one day along the canals with the help of my amazing Tour Guide Vo Duc Thanh from a",
          "A beautiful small town and a highlight in Hoi An. A must see if you are nearby! Get a lantern boat down the river (we paid $400,000 dong for 4 adults) and enjoyed happy hour at a riverside bar afterwards. A lovely and memorable experience.",
          "The streets are narrow, winding & busy. Watch out for scooters. Loads of little boutique shops, clothes shops, knick knack shops & lanterns hung everywhere. Totally picturesque. Make sure you haggle!!",
          "Hoi An is so beautiful City, people friendly and helping. We can find anything we like in here. Great",
          "Very nice town all lit with lanterns. Once you enter the town it looks like really a small road but then it ends up in the big square area with river in between and restaurants and shops around. All are lit with colorful lanterns. Lot of food options and many shops for",
          "Nice old buildings now all full of tourist services. Cafes, hotels, bars, shops, shops, shops. The savvy Vietnamese know that tourists shop like crazy, so go crazy buying lanterns, silk, paintings, leather, tailored clothes and have shoes made for you. There is the usual same",
          "Indeed a beautiful place , lots to do and see . The lanterns are fantastic, the river with boats are cute so you will be bombarded by people trying to sell you a candle /lantern or a boat trip . There is a ticket office by the Japanese Covered bridge where you can get tickets to",
          "We came to Hoi An with a lot of expectations of an authentic, nice,vietnamise gem. The town is indeed beautiful, however is over crowded by tourists and full of shops on the old buildings, which makes impossible to see the original shapes (all the merchandise is on the walls).",
          "My partner and I visited the Old Quarter 3 days in a row because we could not get enough. There are many cute cafes and restaurants to visit and the food is amazing. Definitely check it out!",
          "The old town is lit with lanterns at night and is a must visit. It is absolutely beautiful... the cafes in the winding lanes are amazing.. must must visit.",
          "This is one of the most relaxing places to visit. Its relaxing by day, busy by night. It shows its true beauty at night when the river lights up and all the vendors come out.",
          "quaint. many shops and even a theatre for cultural show and lantern msking. walking streets - safe many eateries and unique shops",
          "Hoi An is an amazing town - very nice to walk around. You must haggle hard and at least at a third of the price that is quoted. You can bike or walk around the town - and there are loads of places to shop at !",
          "Amazing village full of life during the day with it,s markets and shops, and during the night it turns to fabulous lanterns everywhere",
          "After sunset, view here turned. In the daytime, it has wonderful view, but after sunset, all lanterns were lighted. It brought us to old and fantastic world. There were many restaurants here. Prices were various, I mean, from rather expensive to cheaper. We had lunch and dinner",
          "Enjoyed the atmosphere here and walking around this town! I loved the colours and the lanterns at night!",
          "We are pleasantly surprised by this picturesque town. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been in Vietnam. Cosy, cute and affordable. You can get literally anything custom made here at an affordable price!",
          "I really enjoyed my evening walk around Hoi An. It has a very nice relaxing feel to it. It was crowded and busy but not frenetic and uncomfortable. I thought it was clean and well laid out.",
          "Amazing food, cooking classes (Red Bridge highly recommended), shopping, tailored clothes (shop around), beautiful lanterns, it has it all. Watch those bikes!!",
          "Great place. Vibrant and excellent shopping. We had a great time. Did a bike ride through the fields and went to the beach too. Sea water very warm.",
          "Our tour driver dropped us a few blocks from the river as that part by the rivery is mainly pedestrain. We walked thru narrow alleys. We did have to watch out for bicycles and mopeds. At the river, the crowds got worse. We hung around until just before 6 PM when the laterns",
          "It is very colourful and vibrant with lanterns, nice view of Japanese covered bridge and river. There are shops, cafes and restaurants around river and inner side of city. It is a lovely area to discover.",
          "Beautiful visit to visit, 40 minutes from Danang. It\u2019s old center is a UNESCO world heritage site. Make sure you walk around and buy a ticket from kiosks that allows you to enter 5 sites for 120,000 dong, and use them wisely. Make sure you try some of their traditional foods",
          "We loved the quaint old town of Hoi An and were so happy we made it here. So many great shops and food places. You need to stay until after dark to see the beauty of the lanterns everywhere. The boat ride down the river is fun too. I loved the food here more than anything,",
          "Hoi An is such a beautiful place to visit. During the day, you will get to take selfie pictures with its yellow walled houses. At night, the ancient town lit up to become a romantic town of lanterns.",
          "We are very fond of Hoi An and we have already visited it a couple of times. We really like its landscape and relaxed atmosphere. It is nice to stroll around, try some of the traditional Hoi An dishes or have some tailor clothes made. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Touristic, nice and relax place at day time , busy and beautiful old city at night time, good to stay at least one night here",
          "The architecture and the buildings are beautiful. Best to avoid peak holiday seasons as the crowd might not allow you to enjoy the scenery as much. Most of the stores in the area offering pretty much the same or similar products as the area is renowned for. Few good restaurants",
          "Not to be missed while in central Vietnam. We made it a point to get back to the old quarters in the Ancient town in Hoi An every day. Great food choices , superb shopping options and magical atmosphere.",
          "Walking around in Ancient Town is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Go after sunset, and the lights will be stunning. The place is almost drowning with tourists though, but you'll have to live with it. That said, and the place is beautiful, a couple of hours is",
          "Enjoyed walking around looking at the monuments, shops and stalls. Wide range of activities to do here.",
          "Took a cruise in Halong Bay for new year\u2019s celebration. We were on the Mon Cheri 2, which is a newer ship than Min Cheri 1. The boat is very clean, staff are super amazingly friendly, helpful and entertaining (BIG thank you for your hospitality Mr Lam, you are no 1). We opted",
          "We were there on the night where walking was a hassle among tricycles taking tourists around narrow streets. The place deserves more respect with quaint and old buildings full of traditional traits rather than large crowds filling the roads and shops..",
          "I had high hopes for Hoi An after a busy few days in Ho Chi Minh and it certainly did not disappoint! Beautiful little coffee shops everywhere for a cup of Vietnamese coffee - iced or hot while you soak up the sounds and sights. I purchased 4 tailored shirts at a delightful",
          "There are some gems here amongst the myriad of tailors and gift shops. Good to mouch around and pick up reasonably priced gifts. Slightly further out find cheaper eateries.",
          "Such a cute old town. Very touristy and full of people. But you must go at night and see all the lit up lanterns. Take a ride a in lantern lit boat too. Such a great experience We stayed at the Rosemary boutique Hotel and it was great!! This was one of my favorite places in",
          "Little too much people but it good to take time in the streets. Many shops for tourist and others but we came for it",
          "Beautiful place and well worth a visit some excellent restaurants mango mango is amazing a bit more expensive than most but well worth it. Loved the boats on the river",
          "Brilliant place to visit, you can get tickets to enter all of the attractions when you enter the Main Street. It\u2019s generally an excellent atmosphere and the people are so friendly. Great restaurants, cafes and bars to go to. The shopping is great as well. One of the nicest",
          "Overall the city is 5stars and more.Very scenic, old traditional with many old building shops and restaurants with hanging lights over the streets and a big river which separates it in two parts. Walking around is amazing experience and has many things to find in very good",
          "Lots of market stalls here. Variety of food, clothes, and loads of places to eat at. Interesting buildings around the town also. Pretty lanterns on boats at night.",
          "I walked around the street markets and there's a lot of nice restaurant and hand made gift shops with good quality products. I recommend to go here from around 3 or 4 PM; enjoy the streets and you'll get to see the lanterns get turned on at around 6 PM when its getting dark. It",
          "Our tour guide's name was Lee. He was fun, explained the areas in great detail, and was very helpful. He showed my son and myself where to exchange currency at the best rate, I was having back pain from the long flight and he was kind enough to interpret my problem to a local",
          "Hoi an is just amazing. The lantern covered streets, the food, the sights of the waterfront, the night market, the river all lit up at night, the bars. Everything is sensory overload but what I love best is no high rise buildings in sight! It's just a really pretty place and an",
          "Hoi An is really beautiful, especially at night with the lanterns. There are some lovely art and other shops and we found many good restaurants and coffee shops in the old town and nearby. The old town can be extremely busy when lots of tourist buses arrive, but you can",
          "I'm sure Hoi An is the most appealing town to the foreigners as it brings special amazing ancient beauty that is unique in Vietnam. You can ride bicycle around the town, enjoy some famous local street food, have a coffee at the rooftop with stunning view over the ancient town",
          "This place has a vibe, we loved it! We had originally booked Hoi An for 3 nights and ended up extending to 5 nights. Strolling the old town in the early morning is peaceful. We also enjoyed grabbing a Vietnamese coffee in the afternoon and doing some people watching. Of",
          "Hoi An is definitely beautiful, especially at night with all the lighted lanterns but it is ridiculously crowded during peak season! I hope one day they limit the number of people who can access it. If you want to avoid the busy hours, strolling through in the early morning is",
          "Lovely restaurants and souvenir shopping. Can enjoy Bahn Mi or Pho and buy some Weasel Coffee to take home. Very fun way to spend a few hours.",
          "We didn't know a lot about this town before the arrival and we were amazed with everything that we've seen. History, cultural heritage, dinning, shopping, very friendly locals....a must see place!!",
          "It is quirky town full of character. There is a pleasant atmosphere and if you can ignore the shop sellers then you can fully appreciate the town. Massive number of tailors shops and most of them looked quality. If I was coming again, I would do more research.",
          "Multiple streets of shops, cafes and temples. Nice to walk. Cheap to buy Night is very happening for those pubs by the bay. Have lantern boats ride. Try and come here if you are looking around. Walking distance to my hotel.",
          "We recently finished a great private tour of Hoi An with Dzung Cao of Ann Tours. Dzung was highly professional and knowledgeable. He took care of all of our needs including arranging an extra room when one of us was sick. He made alternative arrangements for one family member",
          "Very festive as we were there during Christmas. Lovely to walk around. Pretty lanterns over the bridges. Lots of restaurants and a good vibe.",
          "Love love the vibe of the city at night. There are loads of activities, food, drinks and local shopping. It\u2019s very touristic but it\u2019s the tourists that helps bring the city to life at night as Vietnamese are ones to retire to bed early.",
          "Nice little town to explore on foot or bike. Very touristy and full of tourists of all backgrounds. The advantages of this are good food, reasonable standard of English. The cons are the crowds! The whole \u2018touristy\u2019 vibe. Lots of shops. Lots of restaurants. There are",
          "The Hoi An is a nice place. If you love to see nice buildings or architecture, this can answer your expectation. But...if you are looking for others, i'm mot sure. The things that sell inside the old town is arts, craft and brand name copy things. Public Transportation is bad as",
          "Don\u2019t miss this wonderful area! You can wander, hop into a shop, visit old Chinese homes, peer into artisans\u2018 lives and work, stop for refreshments, and people watch. This is also a very photogenic stretch, with hanging lights and happy decorations. Some places will actually",
          "Known for its lanterns that keep the place lighten, this town allows you to immerse into its rich ancient flavour. The shops and the river are lovely, be it you walk or cycle. It gets really crowded at the bridge area though. Would recommend a night stay here if you like this",
          "Probably spent a few days too many at Hoi An but well worth the trip especially roaming the old town. Food was good but need to be careful as our son did manage to get gastro so be selective on what and where to eat! There are too many of same same shops but if you look hard",
          "Loved the many times we went into old town, well worth a visit if your in the Hoi An area. Market and street life are amazing!!",
          "Love the Roof top setting. Enjoy the coffee and also the lively street \"opera\". It's definitely a GREAT spot to chill after Ancient Town visit. Cappuccino & Salted Egg Croissant end my day perfectly. Friendly staff & warm service. Will re-visit again.",
          "Night markets are a must. Lovely street food and great vibe and sooo busy. The gondola rides looked very pretty but did not seem practical. Have a few Jamiesons n dry at the shamrock hotel on the strand before you venture into the markets.",
          "We visited Hoi An after Nha Trang and saw an immense difference between both towns. Hoi An is by far our favourite town in Vietnam. People are really nice, the food is delicious and the town has so much charm. The live music in the restaurants, the food stall and the laterns",
          "planning a xmas family reunion away from European temperatures yet able to please an age range from 8 months to 72 years - well Hoi An is good shout . A fascinating mixture of friendly locals , a huge selection of only a few kinds of shops , really interesting history and",
          "A quiet city which many old houses. This is the most beautiful city in our traveling 2 weeks. We definitely come back and recommend to our family and friends",

          "One of the best places to visit. Can be a bit crowded but beautiful area to walk around. Old buildings are well preserved. During the day you can see the buildings and in the evening the lights give it a total different ambience. A lot of nice restaurants to choice from.",

          "Terribly crowded it is a never ending succession of small shops, cafes, restaurants etc. There are some old houses which can be visited",

          "amazing place i feel one of the best tourist spots in vietnam. i recommend u get there an hour before sundown so that u can see the lanterns come on. lovely place just loved it. similar shops all over. restaurants near the water were overpriced just go 2 blocks here and there",
          "lots of shops but the stuff are pretty much similar. bags, shoes, paintings etc. prices are very expensive. bought a shirt that\u2019s over twice the price of the same one at ho chi minh :( night time has much more people than during the day, can just spend about 2 days at hoi an,",

          "A great place to hang out for a few days. This town really comes alive at night, with what must be thousands of colorful lanterns alight and mobs of tourists thronging the old narrow streets. It feels like an enormous party. There are some wonderful old assembly halls and",
          "I would never come back. Bad food almost everywhere. Good massages. Dangerous bicycling. Dirty and crowded and noisy.",
          "Definitely worth the trip. Spent a lot of time wondering around the stores. A lot to see. When shopping try bartering for a lower price! Do a lot of shopping around because often they will sell the same things as the store next door.",
          "Was walking into town and got stopped by white south african on about new hotel opening up he gave us winning cards and next is flagging a cab to take us to a \"convention centre\" to claim prizes. We got rid of him and then spotted 2 of them spying out tourists.",
          "fascinating place to explore during the day and magical at night, especially the night market and floating lights and lanterns.",
          "Everyone who had been to Vietnam told us to head for Hoi An. Well it does deserve the accolades, it is a very charismatic and aesthetically beautiful place. The people are very friendly and it\u2019s a great base from which to visit attractions such as My Son, Marble Mountain, Ba Na",
          "It's a shame of what has become of the once calm old town Hoi An, it felt claustrophobic to walk around doing the day, it's a bit better at night.",
          "Very beautiful. However the rating was due to the over crowding and the seemingly licence the locals have that if you are not Vietnamese you are gate game to be ripped off. Go see it- once. Bargain down everything by half or don't buy it. T the exception id's the coconut",

          "The ancient town is a great place to walk around. It's clean and safe, there's lots of stores selling pretty much everything, and the prices are good. Don't forget to haggle - you'll save at least 30% Make no mistake - it's a tourist trap - but it's a fun one. Daytime and",

          "Hoi An ancient town is a fun place to hang out at in the evening, with good food and shops. The shops here over charge you if you're a foreigner, definitely have to bargain and shop around. This town is known for clothes and leather purses/shoes and fast service if you want to",
          "This town at night is amazing with the lanterns and bright colours and boats. It's really pretty. Its got a variety of stalls in the night Market selling the same 5 types of things, and a lot of bars and eateries all over. Its let down by the incessant sales people peddling",
          "A tourist trap. We got a feeling that everything is over priced to the teeth everywhere around old town. Restaurants, stands and everyone try to sell so much as they can as soon as you enter a store or just look into a store. I like the atmosphere, buildings and artwork but the",
          "Went there on our third day. It was crowded as always. The day and night was full of people. There were lots of night market stalls, restaurants and massage parlours too. Will come back for sure next time. Before we left we took a HK$60 30minute boat ride to place lanterns too.",
          "The old town is relatively small but very enjoyable if you like history, food and shopping. It gets very crowded in the afternoon and early evening. If you go as the market is opening around 10am it\u2019s very quiet. I highly recommend spending some time here and especially checking",
          "Wonderful. I could walk around here all day. The color, history and people make it so charming. Think Siem Reap, but bigger and prettier. Less ancient monuments but still very enjoyable weather cycling around town, enjoying the markets, water puppets, basket boats or lantern",

          "We found ourselves in \"Old Town\" almost every day of our 7 day stay in Hoi An. The mornings & early afternoon were quietest, with walking tour groups filling up the street from about 3pm onwards. There are many, many restaurant choices, lots of coffee spots & some great shopping",
          "We loved walking around the ancient town, visiting the night market and walking across the bridges. Stunning at night when the sun sets. Come here before the crowds in the morning for a good wonder around",
          "Nice place to wander in the day and night. No motorbikes in the market area, so it's nice to walk around. The small boat ride with the lantern is pretty cool too.",

          "The ancient town is completely out of this world it is so beautiful and charming. You can get lost wondering around the streets looking at all the beautiful buildings and the delights the shops have to offer. We spent 4 days in Hoi An each day we went to the ancient town and I",

          "I liked old town. My only complaint is that it is described as a walking area only and it definitely is not. There are vespas everywhere that don\u2019t obey any type of traffic laws. Constant honking. It\u2019s not as peaceful as I had hoped. We also allotted too much time for it. You",

          "Loved the sights especially the area where no vehicles are allowed to enter. Rented bicycles and tried to visit every street in the area. The night view was even more stunning, worth the trip if it wasn\u2019t for a few shop owners who were terribly rude and proud. When we would not",
          "Generally I love Hoi An Ancient Town but it comes with a recommendation.Along the adjacent coastline there is a multitude of luxury brand hotels in the process of construction when these become operational I do worry that during peak times the little town will become unbearably",
          "If I come back, Hoi An city will be where I stay. This place has it all. History, culture, authenticity, shopping, restaurants, bars and beautiful people. We came back day after day from our hotel outside Hoi An city, and still didn't manage to see probably half of what these",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "A lot of the negative reviews here focus on the heat, crowds, and expensive tours. All these are within the persons control and can be easily avoided. I came to the site at dawn by rented scooter with a friend, and we were literally the first and only people to walk in at about",

          "These ancient Hindu temples worth a visit. Smaller in scale and size in comparing to the others in South East Asia but they have their own attractions. Highly recommend to come early in the day with a small group for the best photos.",
          "This place is a wonderful place to see an ancient city made from a group of vietnamese tribe. Full of architecture and history. This place was heavily bombed during the war which you can see as you walk around the sanctuary which makes it a sad and enjoyable experience.",

          "These ruins are about an hour ride from Hoi An, and well worth the trip. They are on a continuum with the Angkor ruins and UNESCO has done a great deal of work here in partnership with Vietnam and India. You need about 90 minutes to 2 hours of walking over uneven terrain and as",

          "I enjoyed seeing historical sites. My Son sanctuary is named as UNESCO heritage site. The temples are built by the Cham people during 3 to 7 centuries. The temples are correlated to Hinduism. The bricks are not cemented but using a tree raisins as a glue. Many of the temples",
          "We had a wonderful half-day at the site. We did not have a tour-guide but it was not necessary for us as we have been already to several similar sanctuaries. There is a small museum near the entrance which is worth having a look. Although there is still a lot of conservation",
          "We booked a local tour that picked us up at 4:30am. By 6am we were at My Son entrance and went in, just in time for the sunrise. There was hardly anyone in the park and at the sanctuary. Totally worth the early start! The site itself is very impressive. It was a first of a kind",

          "As per other reviews this is probably more suited to archaeological enthusiasts as it\u2019s quite a journey from Hoi An (we got a private taxi that waited there for us for $38). The ruins themselves are interesting but I would advise getting a tour guide as the information there is",

          "It is worth to spend half day to visit this archaeological site. One of the best places in Danang to explore and understand the past of Vietnam.",
          "Simply a remarkable place. Thousand plus year old temple complex situated in a valley surrounded by mountains and the pulse of centuries. An enriching and beautiful site.",
          "Full of rich history and culture, I'm so glad we were able to make it there- with a sick toddler on a stroller. We saw shiv lings everywhere, and this was totally unexpected as we had not researched before going. We spent a good 3 hours there and it was one of the most",
          "Despite the heat - we managed to spend nearly two hours here at My Son recently. It helped that we had an English speaking guide to explain some of the features and history behind these ruins. This is definitely worth a visit if you are in the Hoi An region. Make sure you take",
          "The walk from the shuttle bus is way too long for the climate of Vietnam. We arrived completely soaked with sweat. The ruins themselves are nice and interesting, but not so special, compared to ruins in neighbouring countries. If you have a free day it is a nice day out, but I",
          "A location that has century old Hindu Temple ruins that were used for religious ceremonies by the Champa people. These ruins have scars from the war through B-52 bombings, pillage and probably vandalism has had some part of the damage that's evident. The construction of these",
          "We were on a half day tour and were pleased to have Elena as our guide. Elena had in depth knowledge of the My Son archaeological site and the culture of the Cham people who inhabited this area. The music and dance performance was most professional and added to the",
          "Definitely a place worth seeing, quick look will take you about an hour, with a guide you wouldn't understand anyway it could be 2. It's boiling hot so go early and be prepared We rented a car with a driver for 35 USD (hour from Hoi an), who waited for us. Tickets are 150000 in",
          "My son sanctuary is an interesting site where you can find a cluster of Hindu ruined temples built between the 4th and the 14th century. They are interesting, but if you come from Angkor Wat, which is what I did, then you can easily skip it. If you are in Hoi An you need to",
          "Despite it being unbearably hot this place is to be admired for the incredible architecture and will of the people to restore this place that was bombed and damaged during the Vietnam War. You see restored sections of this Hindu sacred place as well as sections destroyed and",
          "We took a private car here - no need to book a tour if your English is OK. It takes about an hour from Hoi An by taxi. We arrived at the gates to buy a ticket which is 150000 VND and from there you take a short walk to the museum and past there 2 minutes to the electric buggies",
          "An inspiring sanctuary to visit in Vietnam. Full of history and ruins of temples. Make sure you go with a guide though.",
          "This is a great peaceful place. The children liked it and the guide, Thao, really helped: he was great. You should visit the museum before the site visit though, as it is very informative.",
          "If you have been to Borobudur in Yogyakarta, then My Son is considered amature! Nevertheless, it still has its interesting history and worth a visit, after all it's a World Heritage Site!",
          "We went to My Son Sanctuary on a private trip. Arrived there thinking we had to walk, so we were very happy with the electric transport. The sanctuary is a must see because it is different to the other visiting places in Vietnam. And besides nature is very beautiful",
          "During our short stay in Hoi An we booked a visit to My Son. In our case, due to 2 small kids (girls ages 4&6) we decided to hire a private car through the hotel for 40$ which included 1 hour drive to/from My Son and a driver waiting for 2 hours at My Son. A guided tour we",
          "Beautiful place. Incredible to see bomb craters next to 1,300 year old temples. Humidity was a bit difficult so take plenty of water!",
          "Did this as a half day trip from Hoi An. There were 10 of us and we arrived around 9am, it was not very busy. After the short walk over the bridge, we jumped straight onto a buggy and were driven the 2 kilometres to the drop site. From here you can go either way along the path",
          "A must see. The history and heritage of this place is awesome. It\u2019s a good idea to take an umbrella as it gets quite hot if you want to spend any amount of time there.",
          "At first I was quite interested but after a while it becomes a case if seen one, seen them all and it gets a bit boring especially as most of them are falling down. Take plenty of water to stay hydrated and wear sensible shoes, so many people walki ng around in heels! At the end",
          "My Son is south of hoian and is a must see place. The Cham people built out of wet brick and then carved various things into the structure and then covered it in logs and set it on fire to harden the brick. There is no mortar between the bricks and I have been told they probably",
          "It takes 1 hr and 20 min from Da Nang hotel to the site. It is better to spend around 2 hours in the site because it takes time to walk from one site to another.",
          "Wow... temples older than Angkor Wat... construction similar to Roman temples.. bomb craters from the Vietnam/ American war ... and in a beautiful jungle setting ... a controversial site for many reasons and well worth the visit...",
          "We were on a group tour of Vietnam and whilst we were in Hoi An we were scheduled to visit here. It was a very pleasant bus trip from Hoi An and we got there reasonably early to avoid crowds. The car park is a distance from the actual site and once through the ticketing area",
          "Give yourself about 1.5-2 hours here. We came when the sky was misty so there weren't many people at all. We almost had the place to ourselves. The old temples are beautifully decorated. Some are restored and some aren't. There are a handful which are currently being restored so",
          "My Son Sanctuary is interesting place to explore, we booked our tour and one of the highlights of our visit is our tour guide which makes our journey fun, Great sense of humor and knowledgeable tour guide. Thumps up\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "My Son Sanctuary was well worth the 45 min drive from Hoi An Town. Such a magical place. Wish they had an audio tour but watched a great documentary on the flight over with Vietnam Airlines so was well versed for our visit. Worth going in the early afternoon rather than the",
          "Fascinating cultural spot,interesting history and ruins. Get there early! We arrived at 730 before the bus loads and it was very peaceful.",
          "Great 1/2 day trip while you are in Hoi An to see some history. Beautiful ruins and easy to get to with taxi if you don\u2019t want to do a tour.",
          "Box ticker. a few hours here will be plenty. Interesting history but because of the age most are ruins in very poor shape. Interesting box ticker however. Opens at 7'ish. Go early.",
          "You can't help but be awed by this place. It's both beautiful and steeped in history. It's hot in the summer months but if you get there early you'll beat the crowds and the heat.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Cool atmosphere all around the sanctuary! We rented motorbikes and drove from Hoi An would recommend!",
          "My son sanctuary is a must see if you are in Hoi An area. Temples are magnificent and the area is not that touristy. We enjoyed the guide's presentation and learned much about the misterious culture that thrived here all those years ago.",
          "This historic site has partially ruined Temples built by Cham Dynasty between 4th-14th century by the Kings of the Champa. It was about an hours drive from Hoi Am, we took a private tour, leaving at 7am to beat the heat, which is recommended. It was still quiet when we arrived,",
          "We decided to skip an organised tour and simply hired a driver which was the best option for us - family of 5 with 3 x teenagers!! It was very hot so take plenty of water. Allow 2 hours max to walk around - we didn\u2019t hire a guide as there are enough signs and information to read",
          "We go there by using the morning travel. The bus is clean and the guide is super friendly. The view is spectacular because the temple is locate just besides the mountain. Unfortunately, some relic can't be restored",
          "I was disappointed and felt it was a long way out of Hoi An for little enjoyment once there The Temple ruins were average at best and very hot Not for kids which is understandable but I wouldn\u2019t recommend for couples either",
          "We booked a half day tour from the hotel. Everyone was so excited and the tour guide was so nice but we found that the historic temple was disappointing. It\u2019s not really religious at all cause everyone can use shorts or something and the people not really care. And the site is",
          "We decided on this half day outing to My Son Temple in the mountains and a boat ride on the way home, followed by lunch at old town. The tour guide was excellent very knowledgeable and experienced we had a personal driver and boat included. The day was hot and extra water was",
          "Such a beautiful place to visit. They are in the process of restoring some of the buildings which is great. Such a pity about the French taking the heads off the statue's. Look forward to a long walk around uncovering the mystery of My Son. Rides provided to a point but then",
          "Fascinating site with abandoned and partially ruined Temples built by Cham Dynasty constructed between 4th-14th century by the Kings of the Champa. The temples were dedicated to the God Sheiba. Some buildings still in good condition but others were bombed by the US as they",
          "My Son sanctuary is approximately 30-40 minutes from Hoi An by car. We visited on a tour organised by our hotel with a local guide this is recommended. The recommended time to visit was earlier in the morning before the crowds arrive and before it got too hot. The sanctuary is",
          "Set in a lovely wooded valley beside a stream, the remains of Hindu temples built many centuries ago are another casualty of the \u2018American War\u2019. Bomb craters and wrecked buildings are much in evidence. Repairs are underway and it looks like there may be another part of the site",
          "We decided to leave early using a private car and driver (1.5hrs drive from Hyatt Regency Danang). We got there around 8:00am which was smart not only did we beat the heat of the day but arrived well before the coach tours so the ruins were quiet and peaceful. Beautiful setting",
          "We enjoyed hearing the historical facts about My Son. The bomb craters were a sight to be seen! We had our own guide which was excellent value. I would recommend getting one. Definitely good to explore Vietnam and better understand its history. Another tip is to arrive as early",
          "The museum at the site\u2019s entrance positions My Son with Angkor and Borobudur in terms of historical and architectural importance. Given Angkor\u2019s magnificence and size it may be difficult to agree. However, it absolutely deserves the long time required to reach it from Hoi An and",
          "We braved the torrential rain, lightning and thunder storms today to visit MySon. The god where certainly active. Amazing temples that have sustained the conditions over years. How did they actually build to last the time without the technology of today. Great work by both the",
          "This is a hidden place historical site. It is not as great a Angkor Wat but the architecture is more Indonesia in style of building. Lovely place to walk and have a hint of fresh air. Much restoration needed for the buildings. Hinduism influence abounds. Love the ruins And the",
          "Well, if you'll been to places like Siem Reap, or Bagan in Myanmar, then you can probably give this place a miss. There are only a couple of temples to visit and honestly the scale is not as big as Siem Reap or Bagan. Some of the temples are close due to restoration works in",
          "Having visited Angkor Wat, I was interested to see My Son and was not disappointed. I booked a private tour and my guide was very informative, before, during and after my trip. The traditional dance show which I saw before I began the tour was very good and was amazing to see",
          "Very impressed with the temples architecture. Also the music show made me understand the culture of Cham people. Definitely a must-see in Da Nang",
          "We went here during the summer and it was a very historical trip, but i must say, the place is extremely hot and to get to all the sites is extremely tiring. My conclusion is, this place is a must-go place, but only visit the place's main sites (and remember to bring hats or",
          "Booked a private tour to My Son on advice of my agent Loved every minute of it Spectacular scenery Awe inspiring 8th century ruins Hardly any crowds A touching Cham culture performance And the energy of the place was amazing! My guide Trung (from Buffalo Tours) made this place",
          "What an amazing historic place My Son Sanctuary. You will need plenty of water & bring an umbrella for shade, it is almost 5% hotter down in the valley. Our guide was english speaking. Pickup was from hotel, 45km drive. It was worth the trip, the national music, and",
          "It\u2019s rare architecture building and lasting effect that will wow you. Good history lesson for kids and adults. Went there during lunch so lesser people but was hot! Remember to bring caps and put on sun block.",
          "Arranged tour with Eleanor as our guide. Very informative and helpful to us, explaining meanings symbols and history. Recommend trying to attend early morning, as gets very hot and humid,wearing hat, comfortable walking shoes, and taking water, Amazing buildings and structures,",
          "Visit arranged by our tour company so we had no idea what to expect. Our guide was knowledgeable and charming. The Dancers were amazing being both beautiful and elegant. It was such a shame that there was so much damage inflicted to the temples by the US.",
          "This was a very interesting site to see in the jungle, however, do not do this as a tour. We got picked up at 8am and did not leave Hoi An until 9.15am. The tour itself was okay, but a lot of people and in the extreme jungle heat I would've preferred to get my own transport and",
          "We went as the guide made it sound so interesting, but really, as touring in the heat is very tiring, if I had the time again I would give it a miss and spend the day at Hoi An relaxing. However, it is a must if you are not going to Angkor Wat. This is a very much smaller",
          "Went on this half day tour today. It was okay. Interesting to see such old ruins, but you can pretty much see the whole lot in about 20 minutes. We got there at about 9am, just before all the big crowds arrived which was ideal. The drive out to the ruins is beautiful with lovely",
          "These ruins are a pleasant drive out from Hoi An but go early! We had a private driver booked through our hotel and arrived at 8am before the crowds of busses started arriving. The tour guides that are based at the ruins are hit and miss - a family that arrived just before us",
          "Good to see especially if you have a half day needing to kill time but don't go out of your way if you are compromising doing other things. Gets very very hot by 10am and you walk alot in order to see much of the same. Our tour guide discussed the 'bricks' and building of the",
          "Although its an hours drive from Hoi An it is so worth it, see what they built 1000 - 1200 years ago and how they built these temples. the trek through the jungle is not as hard as it sounds, an electric bus takes you half way and then its a gentle to medium walk along paved",
          "There isn't much to see in Hoi An. We stop here en route to Hue. This is interesting given not much is known about the Chams. Its a really small complex and would recommend coming in the morning when there are less visitors. Wouldn't recommend coming on a day trip from Hoi An,",
          "Perhaps what made this experience memorable for us was the fact that we rode a motorcycle to the place. The site contains more ruins then buildings and you can see the craters left over from the bombing in the Vietnam war. If you have seen Angkor Wat in Siem Reap then you might",
          "Our tour guide was excellent and very knowledgeable, and gave us a great insight into the history of the ruins. It is hard to believe they have been there for so long. It is pleasing to see the restoration work going ahead in partner ship with the Indian Government. Be sure",
          "If this were to be your first EVER visit to an archaelogical/historical site then you'll probably come away with a fair impression. However to those who have seen or been to other venues (e.g. Borobudur,Angkor Wat, the Pyramids) you will be disappointed. In fairness, it must",
          "What a fantastic tour - Elena was very knowledgeable and gave us great insight into the history of the ruins. Small, intimate tour, finishing with a sunset cruise - not to be missed! Ali & Doc.",
          "Our tour guide had recommended a trip to My Son. We went in the afternoon arriving about 2pm in time to catch last show. A quick walk over the bridge then ride on electric car takes you closer to the ruins. Our guide was very knowledgeable and made this tour very interesting.",
          "We booked a car and guide through Bookacar Vietnam and did a half day tour to the My Son Sanctuary and then the pottery village in HoiAn. This was total costof$75 Aust. The guide spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable regarding the history and heritage of the area,",
          "Really enjoyed visiting this place and hearing the history. Recommend it as a place to visit. Be sure and take lots of water.",
          "I was able to negotiate with a Grab driver I met the previous day to take me to My Son from Da Nang, on the way to Hoi An for 800K. I tried to catch the scheduled performance there. The schedule on the website is incorrect. They have 4 shows now, instead of 3. Entrance fee is",
          "We took a local private tour from Hoi An and it was a pleasant hour journey away. We reached My Son in the morning and it was already quite hot and the son was blazing. We used a buggy train to get up nearer to the site and from there walked a bit. The history and ruins we saw",
          "First of all to all the naysayers on here: 1. It takes a bit of walking - so people with a disability might not be able to get up close - but still makes for an interesting visit - though I'd suggest not a hot day 2. Yes they are ruins and in the true sense - time and war",
          "We took a private tour and our guide Tony gave us a detailed tour of the sanctuary. However, we were questioning the authenticity of the performance as no one can read the scripts and there\u2019s no way of telling what is real or made up. Beside the performance, my family",
          "If you happen to be in the Central Highlands, they you should plan a visit to the My Son Sanctuary. This site houses a collection of archeological building in various states of repair. A great representation of more than a thousand years of history that, for the most part,",
          "This is a beautiful place for reflection, meditaci\u00f3n and exposure to a very old culture. Make sure you allow yourself at least an hour and that you have time to sit around and understand what went on in those ancient days. No wonder this was a place for worship! One of the",
          "This was part of a whole day out and we spend the full morning there. The temple and remains are stunning and so sad to think that until bomb by the USA in the 60's it was virtually complete. The guide was really knowledgeable and informative and this was one of the best",
          "My Son Holly Land Was Built In 4th to 13 century by ancient Champa people .They was living in the Central of Vietnam from 192 to 1832 .An amazing with 72 ancient buildings but remained about 25 temples because which were distroied in Vietnam War. My Son was recognized by UNESCO",
          "A significant historical sight recognised by UNESCO, this is a great attraction. However its condition is a sad reflection of what it was before being needlessly bombed by the USA. What's left is limited and crumbling, with poor restoration that clashes with the original and is",
          "A really enjoyable visit with some stunning, ancient ruins. The setting is green and beautiful. The museum at the beginning provides some nice insight to those without a guide (like us). Definitely worth visiting! Entrance is 150 000 Dong.",
          "We had a fabulous fun loving guide who spoke great English and was more than happy to guide us through the fabulous ruins of My Son. His knowledge was thorough and entertaining, which brightened a very drizzly wet day.",
          "I visited My Son on a day tour from Hoi An, and recommend doing the guided tour, as you'll learn so much more about the place and the people who built the city. There aren't many ruins in Vietnam as in Thailand, but My Son is well worth visiting. In 1969, there was heavy",
          "The park opens up at 0630 skip the tours and tour buses. We secured a taxi from Hoi An for 900,000 vnd and left our place at 6:15 and made it there in about an hour. We beat the bus tours and crowds it was not too hot yet and we were able to most of the sites with no one else",
          "Interesting place to visit, in my opinion the price was high although, I think too expensive for what the tour was. The ruins were very nice and had a very interesting history, but there was no much more to see. There is a show of dancers very nice.",
          "Really neat spot to check out. A nice trip on the motorbike from Hoi An. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to do on a tour. Not very much shade so bring water! Best to go in early morning or late afternoon. Places to eat and places to buy water along the way. Offer a free shuttle as",
          "Amazing old Hindu temples. Tickets are 150\u2018000 vnd. Walk a short distance to a small museum. Then a bit further to an electric shuttle to get to the main area. Bring plenty of water for the walk around the ruins. We were there in May and was very hot!",
          "This is a must see when in Vietnam, there isn\u2019t much shade so it\u2019s best to go in the late arvo when it\u2019s not so hot and when there\u2019s less tourists. Most tours don\u2019t cover the entry fee which is 150,000 vnd kids under 5 are free.",
          "My Son is a beautiful place and full of history of the ancient Champa kingdom. There are unique temples here and you will be stunned with the way they did with this holy land in the past. Worth a visit if you are in the central Vietnam.",
          "It was definitely a great place to visit!!  Stunning ancient architectures right in front of your eyes.  Haven\u2019t been to Cambodia\u2019s Angkor Wat (YET), but it seemed to be a smaller version of that.  We saw many repair constructions in progress.  There was also a culture show",
          "Some old temple ruins. If you have been to Cambodia and Angkor Wat, this is not worth seeing. But maybe if you never have seen anything like it. I booked a buss, but didn\u2019t know I had to follow the guide around. So I just left the group and did my own thing. Maybe better if you",
          "I had a private tour here with Tommy Dao Tours....my Guide Tee helped me up & down stairs & even secured a great seat so I could view the Traditional Vietnamese show. There's a lot of walking involved & slippery in wet weather so when we saw a woman in stilettos I tried not to",
          "My Son is about one hour drive away from Danang or Hoian. A UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built around the 4th to the 14th century from the ancient Champa civilization. There were 70+ temples, but majority was destroyed by US bombing during Vietnam War, only less than 10%",
          "We are not a special history lover indulging in learning what's behind the cultural and heritage sites, but we enjoy looking at beautiful architecture and scenery. The My Son Sanctuary is comparatively small in scale but it's still enjoyable in seeing especially the restoration",
          "During our stay in Hoi An, our group visited My Son Sanctuary. My Son is an impressive ancient Hindu ruin site of stone architectural buildings dating back to around the 4th century. Unbelievable stone work & intricacy at its best. Many of the historical building have been",
          "Way out in what feels like the jungle is My Son sanctuary. Not as big as Angkor Wat but has been around for longer. You can definitely see the similarities in the architecture. Upon entering the site you first come across a small museum which has artifacts within as well as",
          "Just one hour drive from DA Nang, it\u2019s a good 2-3 hours outing. In particular was good the souvenirs shipowners with local ginseng in alcohol. The whole area was well selected at the time of the Champa as it inspires peace and meditation. Sad to read the story of the bombs",
          "Awesome ancient architecture set in a stunning location. If you are in Hoi An, do not miss out on a trip here.",
          "We had visitors from Australia, and they are avid tourists, wanting to see all the sights that they could. On the day of our visit to My Son Sanctuary, it was a little overcast, so that made it perfect. I know how hot it gets in the Central Coast Summer! Using the sat/nav in",
          "Fascinating set of temples and shrines set in the countryside, older than Angkor but smaller. You can still see craters from the bombing which took place during the war - it's amazing that any of it managed to survive! I would recommend arriving in the morning (we got there",
          "This is a half day tour. The weather here in mid April is very very hot water is a must! Very impressive rouines. A nice view of the jungle. I would recommended this for an attraction whilst in Hoi An",
          "You will need to stop by this site. Temples built by kings during different centuries throughout history. There are only several sites left due to past bombings. There\u2019s also a museum near the entrance. Remember to bring a hat and sunscreen. It can get hot and humid. Make",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect from this but we were very surprised with this place. From the pickup on the bus, through to the end of our tour, our local guide was all over It. The history of the place, both ancient and modern is amazing. From a country that is so young",
          "This is a nice place. Better your local guide is, better you get to know the information about this place. I loved it, though my pickup from hotel was made with a horrible non-AC minivan and I was in hangover. ;) The walking path has sitting areas near the sites, so you can take",
          "We had already visited Ankor Wat so this complex was rather disappointing on the size especially given how far we had to drive to get to it. I'm not sure it was worth the time, if you are time limited.",
          "This was one of the most amazing sites we visited in the whole of Vietnam. Unlike others it hasn\u2019t been messed around with and constantly restored. Worth watching the traditional dancing at the end - if it\u2019s packed then do what I did and scoot to sit on the floor cross-legged at",
          "The site due to the heavy damage is just a shade of what it probably was just 50 years ago. Pity the war ignorance. Our visit was improved 100% by an amazing guide and his storytelling. Keep your eyes open, look for details and interesting angles a bit off the main paths.",
          "We had visited Angkor Wat last year, and My Son was built by the same Cham people. It is similar, but on a much smaller scale, but what was interesting for us was the various restoration projects. The first was by the Viets and it was a disaster - you can still see the",
          "We visited here on a side tour on a free day on our main tour. We used Urban Adventures which is the sister company to Intrepid our main tour operator. The tour was not a private one but our family of five ended up being the only people on the tour which was great! We left Hoi",
          "The history of the temple ruins at My Son is fascinating. Following the war, there is not much left of the original temples, but a good guide will give you a summary of its rich history dating back 1,300 years. This is a great half day activity. You are taken from the entrance",
          "Having a guide to tell us the story of this place is a must.From how the temples were built to the destruction during the war is worth knowing. During Febuary the weather was ok but any later would make it hot as it is so far into the jungle.The drive from Hoi an is long and if",
          "Me and friend were at My Son Sanctuary for 2 hours. There were traditional folk dancing and music performance at the site, highly recommended.",
          "This place is beautiful and tells a hesrtbreaking story of holy temples in ruin as a result of American bombing in the war. The mountains are also stunning and there is a peaceful river running through the area. There isn\u2019t a huge amount to see and you will probably only spend a",

          "We hired a motorbike and we drove there easilly. It's a nice plan to spend half a day close to Hoi An. I wouldn't recommend going there with a tour as it would be too crowded, it's nicer to explore on your own.",
          "Quite fascinating to learn about the history of this site. What\u2019s left of the Champa temple ruins are beautiful. There is also a traditional dance performance, so check the times on those. It does get crowded with tourists. Bathrooms at the entrance. You are taken in by a",
          "We haven't visited Angkor yet, therefore for us it was impresive to see the ruins of the ancient Champa temples. It was also very sad to see all the bomb craters created during the American War.",

          "My Son was a huge city of the Champa Empire. It was still a huge city being restored until the end of the 60's. But then war happened and most of the buildings were completely destroyed. From the original 71 temples you will find less than 10 still up. There are some restoration",
          "We visited My Son, about 10 in the morning, with our guide, its 40km from Hoi An. My Son dates from the 4th -13th century, and was a Cham Religious Centre devoted to the Hindu gods, set in a lush jungle valley. My Son has been destroyed by time and war, it lay neglected for many",
          "Visited in the afternoon and was just like a post card. Our guide provided great detail on the history which was great! Lovely walk!",

          "My Son is a wonderful place to visit from Hoi An, so different to the maze of the old town. It's set in the jungle among jagged hills. Unbelievably, it was once as extensive as Borobodur or Anchor. Carpet bombing by the US razed most of the complex and left gaping craters around",
          "We are a family of 4 with 2 children under age 12yrs. We had a wonderful visit to My Son Sanctuary and had read up on TripAdvisor to realise that going in the later afternoon would work best for me who is an avid photographer. Later in the day, the throng of tour groups leaves",
          "This place is very beautiful. Lush gardens, water streams and ancient temple ruins. So much history here and recommend visiting",

          "This is a good location for those who love temples. It was interesting to see some of the holes left by the bombings so close to the temples.",
          "Beautiful area but in reconstruction due to the bombings during the war. However the 4th century architecture and the enormity of the site is amazing",
          "I visited My Son on a day trip from Hoi An, and I had a very good time. The ruins themselves are interesting to see; while some are little more than piles of rock, others are still largely intact. It was very interesting to go through the ancient shrines and look at all the",
          "It is amazing to see the beautiful temples of ancient Hindu temples built by Cham kings of the past. While they lie in ruins now and are being preserved as a heritage site, it is revealing to see the spread of Hinduism all the way to Vietnam - the idols of Shiva, Brahma, Indra,",
          "My Son archeological site is such a nice to visit when you visit Da Nang, Vietnam! Although this place is quite far from downtown Da Nang. But its worth to visit!",

          "The ruins are a very interesting place to visit, however definitely come here on your own (or with a small group) and in the morning. The best time would be between 8-9am, after that the busses with organized tours start arriving and all the atmosphere is gone. Without the",

          "If you're interested in Vietnamese history, you need to go see this site. Much as been destroyed. Another effect of Vietnam War and the effect of all the bombs. Significant history was destroyed! A particularly interesting part is the brick structures that have no known mortar"

          "Loved it. Only advice is to visit during early morning or late evening as it gets pretty sunny and hot making it difficult to enjoy the experience. The architecture and whole feeling of being there is awesome",
          "I enjoyed walking the 2 km to the ruins, rather than take the shuttle once there, because the walk was so peaceful and serene. The ruins are beautiful as ruins go, and this site is nowhere near the size of Ankgor Wat, so it was easy to walk \u2026",
          "I came here on a bicycle from Hoi An and had a great time exploring the site and learning about its history. Just imagine what would have the place looked like if it hadn\u2019t been bombed by the U.S. during the American-Vietnam war.",

          "Entrance fee cost 150,000 vnd. Not as big as I thought it would be. The ruins are exactly like you think they will be/exactly what you see in these photos. Almost not worth it but then I saw one of the shows at the theater. It was about 15 minutes and was just three musical acts but it was pretty neat.",

          "Amazing how Champa civilization can replicate its structures and layouts throughout their empire spanning across the South East Asia mainland",
          "A fascinating temple complex dating back hundreds of years. Unfortunately a lot of the temples are in ruins and the huge numbers of tourists walking through the ruins probably do not help in keeping this place up. I went there twice, once \u2026",
          "Big area and need to take a 2 km ride before reaching the site. Need to walk a lot but definitely worth it to see the magnificent ruins. They even provide a live performances to watch and understand the culture of that period.",
          "It's an absolute must see. From temples over a thousand years old to the scars left by the Vietnam-American War, this is a place to dig deeply into the old history and mysterious stories of Vietnam. It's worth supporting, too, as a heritage \u2026",

          "Amazing ruins, they resemble the ones in Angkor Wat but are older than them. The nature surrounding the ruins is beautiful.\nWorth a visit if you are in the area.\nThe staff around the park was a little unfriendly and rude, that was the only bad side",

          "Complex partially destroyed by American bombs during the Vietnam War. Many interesting views outside as well as in the middle. Some restored parts are quite heavily covered by spider webs with hunting spiders. Such a concentration of spider \u2026",
          "For learning history",
          "Worth the trip.  Takes about an hour or so to walk around but this is deep deep history and cultural site.",

          "In Vietnam, it was such a sweet time.\nVisiting the sanctuary here was one of my dreams since high school days, when I read about \"Champa\", the ancient kingdom there.\nAbout 18 years later, it came true! Really very lovely one \ud83d\ude0d\nI have been enchanted twice; by photos and by activity \u263a\ufe0f",
          "Very nice place to visit but take a few things into account. Very large place to walk around in so be prepared with sensible shoes. If you can walk around comfortably for an hour in cobbled stones in flip flops then carry on. There's very \u2026",
          "Impressive. It's a real crime that the Americans destroyed many wonderful buildings.",
          "Love the place with the old charm feel and all the beautifully refurbished shops and restaurants. You can understand the history and earlier settlements of this UNESCO listed site by visiting a few of the history buildings.",
          "Ancient historical site. Intriguing.",
          "There are about 3 Hindu temple ruins here. Hardly worth the drive and the entrance fee. For those who insist, there are some old temple ruins, a few brick structures that are still standing. Some recent reconstruction has been done, but it's unclear whether that enhances or detracts from the original structures.",
          "Don\u2019t have high expectations if you\u2019ve been to angkor wat.",
          "A many clusters of temples in Hinduism of Champa kingdom during the 4th century in Vietnam. If you love old architectures, you should go there with a tour guide! Go there early in the morning if not it is crowed and hot",
          "The heritage site gave me insight into a bygone era. I learned about how construction in the 4th century made use of materials that have withstood the test of time. Also the destruction from human actions during the Vietnam War - the evidence is there to see.",
          "1 hour from HoiAn, this trip is worth a half day. Spent 2 hours exploring by foot. It's about 2 km roundtrip to go through the site. There's a few cafes for snacks and coffee. Some say it's a mini Angkor Wat.",
          "Good location \ud83d\udc4d",
          "I really enjoyed driving a scooter from Hoian. Rice fields, buffalos and farmers. Unforgettable",

          "Nice and impressive place, maybe take a guide for a better exprience..",
          "Myson was belong to chamba kingdom which mostly got destroyed during Vietnam war. There lots of Hindu ruins Temple & so much things to know about Vietnam history. If you are a history lover then don\u2019t miss this place when you are in Hoi An. Myson is 40min distance from hoian ancient town.",
          "very special place. nice temples",
          "Awesome historical site!",
          "A place with a lot of history and beautiful temples.  We enjoyed our walk and learned about the history of Cham.  We went around 2PM and there were not a lot of tourists.",
          "Impressive history. Old rocks and monuments from tempels.",
          "Lovely and peaceful. Lot's of info to read about, be sure to see the performance on the way round the site. Worth it!",
          "i did it i finally found my son hes been gone for so long",
          "This is a well maintained facility with public walkways and bathrooms. Admission isVD150,000. The ruins themselves are limited to 5 sites with 1-2 house sized temple ruins. A half-day trip from Hoi An or Da Nang if you are in the area and desire a bit of ancient culture.",
          "Beautiful temple relics in a peaceful setting. Worth seeing!",
          "What remains after the bombing of the Vietnam War is beautiful, and it is great to see India is working with Vietnam to restore those buildings that they can. It was definitely worth doing the morning tour to escape the heat and the crowds. Whilst arriving later in the afternoon is also a good option.",
          "Nice historic area, with well preserved temples. Each has a bit of history and context on plaques. This doesn't compare to Angkor Wat in scale, and I wouldn't recommend on a hot day (~40\u00b0c when we went). There are rest stops with drink and ice cream, but the actual temples are largely uncovered",
          "Amazing place. Shame a couple of the temples were destroyed by US bombs, but there's still plenty to do and see. Try and arrive really early before the swarms of tourists arrive. We basically had the place to ourselves.",
          "Worth the visit in one morning if you come to Hoi An. I did previously see Ankor Wat temples but these My Son Hindhu temples are nice too with a different history!",
          "My Son itself is a lovely place to visit, but the lady at the ticket office ripped me off. I would not have expected that a world heritage site exploites tourists who are not yet a 100 percent familiar with the currency. Embarrassing!",

          "A very interesting city to visit. I recommend first visit museums then check dancing performance hours and then visit ancient city",
          "Definitely not worth it... I read a comment saying that if you have seen some other temple sanctuary before such as Ayutthaya or sukhothai in thailand, you shouldn't go to my son.. But I thought it must be nice seen the reviews.. And I was \u2026",
          "My Son is nice. It's beautiful, but not do spectacular as Ankor Wat in Cambodja.It was bomd during the Vietnam war, but there are still some nice details you can see.",
          "Felt a waste of time when compared to other attractions",
          "Beautifully preserved and restored ruins, a true path through history. Expect a tour bus or two however.\n\nRecommend going from hoi an via scooter - great way to take in the landscape!",
          "Proper shoes are advised as most of the paths are unpaved and can be rocky. The temples themselves are pretty interesting and are in some ways similar to those in Cambodia. A long way from the city so arranging transport is advised. Give \u2026",

          "We rode here from Hoi An by motorbike. The roads getting here weren\u2019t too bad. We arrived late afternoon - around 15:30 and spent around an hour and a half here which was more than enough. It was really quiet which was nice.\n\nThere is a \u2026",

          "Small site and way too many people. Not enough signs for visitors.",
          "Great place to visit.  Loads of really interesting ruins.",

          "A really good place to visit, as there is a lot of history. There are also facts to read and in English.",
          "Must see site. Bombed during the war and many buildings damaged but what is left are ancient temples from earlier people who lived in the area. Well worth the trip.",
          "It\u2019s a nice historical place although at the moment there isn\u2019t a ton there. If you\u2019ve been to Angkor Watt there is absolutely no point to come here. If you haven\u2019t and want to a couple interesting looking small temples then it\u2019s worth the visit.",
          "Majestical, words cant describe. Our tour guide Tony was full of knowledge on the architecture and Cham history. Highly recommend half day tour, it sounds expensive but worth every penny",
          "My Son sanctuary was the worshiping Area of Champa Kingdom from 4th century. They worship the God Shiva- the destroyer in Himduism. Each king of Champa kingdom when they first came to throne, they all built a cluster of temple to worship \u2026",

          "Go to My Son! It's a fantastic place with fantastic service and I love it! 10/10 would always recommend. But probably should rename it because, \"I'm visiting My Son.\" Doesn't sound correct, eh? Maybe not my son but \"My Daughter?\"",
          "Easy to reach by scooter from Hoi An. Ruins site. Nice half day tour you can do by yourself",

          "This was such an awe- inspiring site. Unfortunately we were on a tour with bus loads of other people but when we could find places less populated, the history of this place really hit you and it came to life. Do a bit of reading before you \u2026",
          "Really interesting place, good to visit before the heat of the day and lots of tourists arrive. We got there at 6am and spent a couple of hours. Definitely worth a trip",

          "I personally didn't liked it because there was nothing except broken temples.\nMay be person who have interest in archaeology and deep down history it would be good.\nBut if you are going after 9:00 AM, then be ready to handle the sun heat. Because there is nothing expect walking and heat.\n\nWe almost fainted due to heat. \nAll the best",
          "It is worth the trip out to see this beautiful place and the people.",
          "Very nice bombed temple's for the year 400 till 1100. The tour guide was very good! Gives a lot of information. Don't go between 1 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon because its too hot and there is almost now shadow there",

          "Despite the sadness, due to only remaining 10% of the complex. I still cannot get over the Chams' construction methods that still cannot be replicated by the contemporary techniques.",
          "Good facility provided, but could be better. The official guide was informative but was rushing to finish the tour",
          "this is amazing place for history of Champa. it is a good choice for a day tour from Hoi An or Da Nang",
          "Great site with ruins from a very different time. It's a shame that the war affected these ruins. It would have been great to see it before the bombs destroyed one of the central monuments. Pro Tip: go early to beat the heat and other Tourists.",
          "Very pleasant walk. Usually very hot weather. I liked it.",
          "Highly recommended half day trip from Hoi An",
          "A pleasant half-day trip. There is a museum at the start which helps provide some of the historical and cultural context. Whilst there is a shuttle service to the site, the walk is not very long and quite pleasant. The site is also easy to navigate without a guide.",
          "Pretty impressive historical site with quite a lot to see (8 sites in general). For 150K you get to enter the the area and you'll be driven to the actual sites by a shuttle, as they're at least 1km walking distance away.\nMust-visit in the area I'd say.",
          "The former Cham's kingdom holly place, set up in an extremely humid climate, many centuries ago, makes it even harder to understand the founder's choice of bricks (special formula) as construction technology, while mortar (a kind of resin) being of vegetal origin...",

          "Loved the history behind My Son ruins. You can still see the bomb craters the Americans dropped. Gives it a very unique vibe with all the jungle and destruction that happened here.",

          "A beautiful and important spot to visit. It is huge, but for me the half-day tour was enough. I would definitely do a guided tour so that all the monuments can be explained.",
          "It is a nice temple. But is small if you compare with Angkor or Angkor watt in cambodja. The good point is that you can see how was bombedd and the bombs chraters",

          "Good. Lack of signage neccesitates a guide.",
          "A number of ruins which show the history of the Cham and also examples of what war can do to cultural heritage. Worth visiting imo",
          "The guide was late and not really knowledgeable. I could tell him a few things about the background stories.",
          "Definitely recommend to visit My Son with it's temple complex. Very nice with green all around and have some unique brick structures. There is free shuttle at the bottom of the complex (after the ticket check and museum) which take you one kilometre to the temples which are a bit far.",
          "It is hard to appreciate these ruins without a guide.  Entry fee costs 150K VND.\n\nI book a tour from Klook (not an advertiser no worries) which comes with a bus ride to My Son with a tour guide, bus followed by boat ride (which you have a light lunch) back to Hoi An.  For approx. 10 USD, that is pretty good value.",

          "Nice place, picturesque in the morning. We arrived at 7 am and were first people there, but for a very short time. Sanctuary is 2 km from the entrance, but there are shuttle buses (driver usually waits for more people). Beware of spider webs everywhere if you arrive early!",

          "Should visit my son.. A great archeology site",

          "Absolutely incredible. Wheel chair options all over the site. Wonderful temples and statues. Quite a somber atmosphere and can be confronting seeing all the craters and bullet holes. Would recommend going with a guide.",
          "Very impressive place surrounded by beautiful nature! Unfortunately the oldest temples were destroyed by American bombs during the war, but the remaining ones are still absolutely stunning. Try to visit the site in the morning or the evening, when it is not too overcrowded by tourists.",

          "I think it's depending on your taste. This is a history place that have many section with temples inside. There. We can choose to walk or by shuttle from the main gate, a bit far for me. Better use comfortable shoes because of the stairs and bring umbrella in winter season.\n\nPrice: 150.000 VND\nParking area: Big",

          "Very beautiful ancient city. We walked around for 1 hour, very impressive. It gets quite hot so you might want to go in the early mornings.",
          "Definitely worth to go there. A bit to crowded and tourist place, but really amazing. Rather with organised tour, as a good local guide that explains history on site is indispensable. Take good shoes with you as the ground is wet and slippery even in a dry season.",
          "Very nice but really sad about the destruction of the buildings!",
          "Great place to visit if you have never seen any ancient temples before. \nHighly detailed and sophisticated temples and buildings assembled in a such a way that still puzzles modern day scientists. \nHighly recommend a tour guide here so you can be informed of the background history behind the MySon ruins .",
          "Burdes sesses",
          "It's a historical place with many brick ruins. You get driven to the place by electric oversized golf carts, and then you walk around for 2 hours in the ruins. It all looks the same.",
          "Like a mini angkor wat, also a Unesco world heritage site",
          "Unique. Beautiful. Lethally hot temperatures.\n\nThere's a reason it's a UNESCO site but be prepared for the heat.",
          "Awesome place where you can see how your entry fee is put to good use.",
          "Magnificent, educational, nice little cafe at the end with good coffee. \nIf you can handle getting up at the buttcrack of dawn for the sunrise tour, do it. It's so much more calm, so much less hot and with a smaller group of people where \u2026",
          "Really touching to see the ancient building been destroyed by the Vietnam war, with half of the sanctuary\u2019s demolished and bomb craters everywhere added extra history. Some of the ruined were badly reconstructed but overall definitely worth a visit!",
          "There seems to be effort to preserve the monuments but sadly the guide was late and not very knowledgeable in the religious background.",
          "If I can suggest something, do a sunrise or sunset tour, morning tour, one is unable to. Appreciate the beauty of the structures. \n\nI find that most of the structures are being built and as a result, near 80% not authentic, but still a beautiful site to visit while you here.",
          "Very beautiful nature and temples!",
          "150,000 dong entry fee. Some very old ruins dating back to the 5th century. Not the best tourist attraction out there but worth checking out.",
          "Too many people, no English guide/information book available and very poor toilet facilities.",
          "You need to pay 150k to get in. Ones you are in you will be transferred by an electric car to a resting area. Then you need to walk around to see around.",

          "Very interesting and fascinating to learn how only recently discovered",
          "Amazing wish it hasn't destroyed by USAF bomb attack",
          "Worth visiting to appreciate Vietnam culture esp during sunny day. Performance is good.  Sites are exposed - wear sun screens.  Better if more foreign languages be used to introduce exhibits and site.",
          "Make sure you get there as early as possible to avoid the crowds and the heat. We did it without a tour guide and still enjoyed it. We spent two hours there and managed to see everything but you may want a little longer if you want to linger or if you went later in the day. We got there at just past 7.",
          "Worth the money",

          "Very interesting history. With a good guide you will enjoy for sure.",
          "Worth the visit. The site is incredible, there's also a museum and restaurant. Free motorbike parking right outside of the paying parking. When you enter, there's a free shuttle that takes you to the ruins (and back to the entrance when you're done) (or 2km walk).",
          "Historically i interesting",
          "Spirit of this ancient place is strong! Really breathtaking scenario. In the middle of the day in january 2019 place was not so crowded. Good service with electric buggy taxi from parking to cluster.",
          "The story behind is interesting but the temple ruins are not impressive. I'm not sure if it is worth the drive(1h from Hoi an or Da Nang)",
          "Beautiful place, the nature growing over the ruins of ancient temples makes it a stunning spot, very peaceful too. I took the sunrise trip, so there were almost no turists, with high temperature and full of turists might not be so good, in the early morning the temperature is fine.",
          "Fascinating insight into the past. Beautiful setting.  Excellent  cultural performance  by dancers. Well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing....",
          "Pretty location. Temples are quite small and easy to walk around. There are few traditional performances during the day too. A few shops to buy water, ice cream and souvenirs. We took a private car as we have small kids and it was easier \u2026",

          "I wish the site the best of luck, but it felt like a tourist trap because there is not much context to really understand the ruins. For example, why did the Champa people leave? My tour guide didn't expain. Maybe an audio tour would make the ruins more interesting?",
          "Peaceful place in the mountain area. Buy ticket at the entrance and then small cars take you 2km Up the hill from where you can walk among the ruins od old Champ temples. It's good to go in the morning to avoid crowds. You can also hire a guide here to walk with you. Beuatiful place with mysterious vibe.",

        "wiki": "Vietnamese art  is visual art that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists.\nVietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the Stone Age around 8,000 BCE.With the millennium of Chinese domination starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.\nBy the 19th century, the influence of French art took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.\n\n\n== Traditional art ==\n\n\n=== Neolithic art ===\n\nPottery dating to the Stone Age (c. 8000 BCE) has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam.  This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare.  Moving into the neolithic era, however, Vietnamese pottery and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.\n\n\n=== Bronze Age art ===\nThe highly developed \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture that flourished in North Vietnam (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n drums, a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.\nThese drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life.  They were elaborately decorated with geometric patterns, and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.\nArchaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth.  Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.\n\n\n=== Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD ===\nDuring the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.\n\n\n=== From the Ng\u00f4 to Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty ===\nVietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished.  The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the Tang and later Song Dynasty's art, including applying the \"three colors\" concept to its ceramics.  Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of Cham influences to be found as well.\nThe L\u00fd Dynasty, beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia.  The L\u00fd Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the Temple of Literature, One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda.  The Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.\n\n\n=== Fourth Chinese domination and L\u00ea Dynasty ===\n\nThe fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination.  Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost.  It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of sinicization was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.\nConsequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the L\u00ea Dynasty was heavily influenced by the Ming Dynasty's art.\n\n\n==== Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty ====\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art.  Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty.\n\n\n== Modern art ==\nVietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between the 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of \u201cEcole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine\u201d in October 1925. Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.A striking \u201cshift\u201d was obvious after the founding of Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art's sake. Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying cultural transfer and modernity.\n\n\n=== The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945 ===\n\nEcole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine EBAI was founded by Victor Tardieu, a French academic and naturalist painter. With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school \u201cEBAI in Indochina\u201d to train real artists. Unlike, Ecole professionnelle\u201d in Hanoi, \u201cEcole des Arts Cambodgeins\u201d  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 \u2013 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen. Tardieu's idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in \u201cEcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris\u201d by including art history; technical course like oil painting and perspective, to train student into real artist. He planned to \u201chelp the Vietnamese artist to get back in touch with the deep meaning and fundamental inspiration of their own traditions\u201d.Ngay Nay (Nowadays) Phong Hoa (mores) which was associated with Tu Luc Vaan Doan (Self Reliance Literary Association), were committed to modernising Vietnamese culture through the crucial assessment of both Vietnam's tradition and Western modernity. Students in the EBAI were columnist in this 2 weekly magazines, illustrating cartoons and exhibition information. The stylized cartoon illustration were in fact very modern, depicting simple messages.\n\n\n==== Oil Painting ====\n\nFollowing closely to the curriculum of Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, oil painting was first introduced to students as a completely new medium. Although western art, in this case, oil painting, was likely first encountered by Le Van Mien (1873-1943) in L\u2019Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts de Paris, who returned to Hanoi in 1895, no record shows that he taught and trained craftsman in Bien Hoa or Gia Dinh this western medium. This medium was thoroughly unknown to the students, and Joseph Inguimberty though it would be hard to assimilate the oil painting techniques to them. \nArtist like To Ngoc Van was able to combine western aesthetic techniques like linear perspective, imitation of nature and modelling in the round into his own oriental traditions with oil medium. Stylized as the \u2018poetic reality\u2019 style, his works sets female ideals into a linear perspective in an enclosed space, juxtapositioned with flat coloured area, his works emulates with the tendency idealization imagery.\n\n\n==== En Plein Air ====\nSimilarly, en plein air was another major practice instituted in EBAI's curriculum.  Students were brought outdoor for field trips to develop their painting sense of the environment. As noted by art historian Nora Taylor, \u201c[He \u2026 propped his easel under a tree by rice paddy, took off his shirt and proceeded to sketch farmers planting their rice seedlings. Needless to say he earned quite a few giggles and embarrassed glances from his subjects.\u2019 Nobody took off their shirts in public, not even the farmers in the fields. The French did and so did To Ngoc Van.\u201d  This example quoted by Taylor, argues that the tendency of idealization, we see in To Nga Van's painting reflects a distancing and detachment with the subject matter, a result of artist's attempt to emulate their French teachers inclusive of whatever they do.Other than oil medium and en plein air painting method, significant assimilation and adaption of local culture were encouraged by Victor Tardieu and his successor Joseph Imguimberty.\n\n\n==== Lacquer Painting ====\n\nJoseph Imguimberty was fascinated by the lacquered cultural objects and architecture fixtures after visiting the Temple of Literature in Hanoi. He encouraged his students to start using lacquer as a fine art medium, and set up workshops in EBAI with old artisans, playing a renaissance role in Lacquer painting. \u201cfalling back on the past will be efficient only if it is used as a starting point for a new research, for an evolution in line with the contemporary eras; to summarise, the question is to evolve as contemporaries within an extensive of tradition.\u201dVictor Tardieu\nMaking lacquer painting takes several months, using resin from Son tree taken from the plantation from Son Mai region, numerous layers of application are applied to acquire the desired colour and effects.  Most notable artist who excelled in this medium is Nguyen Gia Tri. Although artists like Tran Quang Tran, Le Pho, Phan Hau, Nguyen Khang and Nguyen Van Que attempted lacquer painting, Nguyen Gia Tri's achievement in lacquer painting is remarkable for his research on pigments and exploration of new lacquer colours. Nguyen Gia Tri's aim \u201c was to obtain the same level of painting as with the oil medium regarding perspective, modelling in the round, and infinite variation of colours\u201d.\n\n\n==== Silk Painting ====\n\nOther artists like Nguyen Phanh Chanh, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Tan Van Can, Le Van De,  who were the first batch of students to be admitted in EBAI, are most notable for their silk painting.Like lacquer painting, silk painting was much encouraged for exploration in the school. Different from similar practice of silk painting in China and Japan, an intensifying of cultural transfer was observed in Vietnamese silk painting, artist like Nguyen Phan Chan blended western composition principle with eastern tradition like calligraphy and brush paintings.\n\nIn 1931, Paris International Colonial Exhibition, Nguyen Phan Chan\u2019s work titled Children Playing a Game of Squares was well-received and this recognition firmly established the medium as a modern Vietnamese expression.\nBetween 1930 \u2013 1936, Nguyen Phan Chan, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu and Nguyen Gia Tri, graduated from EBAI. Victor Tardieu died in 1937 and he was took after by Evariste Jonchere. To Ngoc Van begin teaching in EBAI in 1937. Artists like Bui Xuan Phai and Nguyen Tu Nghiem who entered EBAI in 1941 was unable to complete the full five-year programme due to the 1945 revolution.\nA bombing of Hanoi that was intended for Japanese target destroyed part of the EBAI painting department in 1943, resulting the sculpture department to be moved to Son Tay; Architecture and sculpture department to Dalat while applied arts went to Phu Ly.\n\n\n=== The Time of Resistance wars 1945 - 1975 ===\nResistance war uproar marks the official close down of EBAI in 1945. Democratic Republic of Vietnam reopened a fine arts school in Hanoi for a short period of time in September 1945 ruled by To Ngoc Van. However, artist were sympathetic of the Viet Minh and decided to leave Hanoi to join the resistance movement against French in the Hills of Tay Bac.\n\n\n==== Artists in the North ====\nNotable group of artists in the North during the Cold War were T\u00f4 Ng\u1ecdc V\u00e2n, Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n C\u1ea9n, Hu\u1ef3nh Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0110ong, Ph\u1ea1m Thanh T\u00e2m, Minh Tuyen, Hoang Trung. Another small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part. Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.\nWhen Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence on 2 September 1945,  Vietnamese artist begin to resist the influence of romantic realism, tendency for nostalgia past and melancholic dreams. Artist like To Ngoc Van shook off his romantic style and turned towards modern realism, he moved the closed EBAI (after the Japanese coup de force in March 1945) to Viet Bac in 1950, the military base of the Revolutionary Army under Ho Chi Minh.\u201c[He]\u2026 decided that art, as the French saw it, died in 1945 when Viet Nam declared its independence and was reborn in 1946 when the Viet Minh moved the art school to the hills of Viet Bac, the seat of the revolutionary movement. In 1946, he declared proudly \u2018tradition starts now.\u2019\u201d \n\nTo Ngoc Van begin teaching resistance art classes in the Northern zone during the war with the French. This includes setting up the \"School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone\", and combating against decadent art being scientific, national and popular,  art have to abandon religion, mythical and idealists theme, focusing solely on the inspiration and needs of the revolution and being appealing and educational to a majority of people. Hence artists like Nguyen Hiem, Nguyen Sang, Phan Van Don and Tran Van Can created works that depicted the countrysides, portraits of peasants, soldiers battles scenes, they uphold the belief that artist should show the reality of society instead of idealised imageries.To Ngoc Van died in 1954 as the result of injuries received at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone was later moved to Hanoi in 1955 and named as the \u201cVietnam College of Fine Arts\u201d with Tran Van Can as the principal.\n\nFirst National Art Exhibition in the Democratic Republic of Vietna in 1955, after the victory at Dien Bein Phu where Meeting (Gap Nhau) by Mai Van Hien was praised as the ideal painting that illustrates the idea of community and solidarity between the soldiers and the common people. \"The mood of the painting is reflected in the artist\u2019s simple descriptive style, which lends itself well to its content.\"\nIn a Painting Exhibition that in happened December 10, 1951, Ho Chi Minh sent a message to the artists that  \"you, in the artistic field, have your own responsibilities - to serve the resistance, the Fatherland and the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants and soldiers,\"However, various debates erupted in Hanoi on the role of artists in Society in 1956, during the first meeting of the writers and artist associations, members demanded for greater freedom of expression which went against what Ho Chi Minh had earlier laid down. Two art and literature journals Nhan Van (humanism) and Gia Pham (Art Works) that supported the argument were subsequently banned.Following year, Vietnam Association of Fine Arts in Hanoi or National Arts Association was established with 108 member headed by Thai Ba Van. These members were required to be members of the association if they wished their works to be exhibited or sold. There were no private galleries where artists can displayed their work formally. Eventually, this association was governed with official rules and regulations, members are obligated to hold one exhibition at local level annually and another at national level every 5 years. Non members were not considered artist, hence they have no opportunity to display any form of art publicly.Between 1950 and 70s, members were paid as \u201cart workers\u201d for the poster designs and illustrations, among few were elites who painted paintings for state visitors.Realist style, which corresponded with Northern artists initial aspirations, was vital in the early days of revolution, however, due to the strict constraints by the DVR regime and decreasing subsidies, realist trend reached an apex in the 60s. Strict guidelines were attempted to established in 1962, on the productions of artists artworks, they need to portray a \"National Character\", subject matters were usually the countryside, battle scene, portrait of Uncle Ho.\n\n\n==== National Paintings ====\nAnti-colonial and resistance war culminated the appropriation of \u201cnational\u201d art. It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by Nam Son, Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium. The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as \u201cnational\u201d.\n\nIn Tran Van Can\u2019s Portrait painting \u201cMilitia women of a costal region\u201d, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy. It is a politically correct painting, filled with characteristic that fulfills the national painting.Another theme commonly captured by artist was the landscape around Viet Bac. In the Diep Minh Chau\u2019s \u201cUncle Ho\u2019s House in Viet Bac\u201d show clear proficiency with the medium oil painting, the impressionist strokes of capturing the light through filtering leaves.\nIn Duong Huong Minh\u2019s \u201cHauling Up Canons\u201d a work on lacquer captures dramatic scene of soldiers hauling heavy weapons up a steep slope. The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.\n\nSimilarly, in watercolour painting painted by Pham Thanh Tam during resistance war \u2018shows a clear French influence. His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAI\u201d the drawings and diary clearly contents \u201clyrical and poetic quality\u201d it was regarded as ideal paintings.[21]Hence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that \u201cthe realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.\u201d[22] Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French.\n\n\n==== Propaganda Posters ====\n\nPropaganda poster painted during the period of \u201coperation rolling thunder\u201d in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh's concept, was to \"stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development\".[23]\u201cCulture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.\u201d [24]\"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond.\"[25]\n\n\n==== Artists in the South ====\nVietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the Geneva Conference in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United States of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is Ta Ty, who \" considerably bolstered the South\u2019s artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons.\"Nguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for \u201cEcole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh\" founded in 1954.[26] Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.[27]In 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.[14]Between 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.\nAfter the reunification of Vietnam, southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.[14]1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.[14]\n\n\n=== The Period of Renewal from 1985 ===\nArtists benefited from greater freedom of expression after the launch of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi campaign. The economic reforms allowed artists a greater outlet for creative expressions.[14]However, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine My Thuat (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.[28] The workshop was not acceptable by authority for \"the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community.\"[29]\n\n\n== Contemporary Art ==\nNowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide. For example, Nha San Collective (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998,  was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam. Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s\nRMIT University Vietnam art collection is one of the most prestigious collections of contemporary Vietnamese art in the world. This collection is not only historically important, but one that will continue to grow the understanding of Vietnamese culture for generations to come. The Vietnamese artists in the collection range from established and mid-career artists, whose works feature in significant exhibitions and notable private collections and public institutions worldwide, to young emerging artists who continue to tackle issues with fresh and new interpretations.\nRMIT University is at the forefront of creative education and this collection allows both students and the wider community to experience the artistic expression of an important generation of contemporary Vietnamese artists. The art collection is managed by the RMIT Library Vietnam.\n\n\n== Cinema ==\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nIt is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums.  Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.\nWhen Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, Chinese architecture had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of scholar-bureaucrats, aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters.  Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.\nWith French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc.  Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the French colonial legacy.\nSome of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:\n\nThe Temple of Literature or (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu): Located in Hanoi, North Vietnam.  It was constructed during the L\u00fd Dynasty and dedicated to Confucius and his disciples.  It is a fine example of the elegance of L\u00fd Dynasty architecture, although much of it is in need of repair.  The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone steles.  These steles are placed on top of stone turtles, and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the Imperial examination.  Also within the temple lies the \"Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m\" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779.\nImperial City, Hu\u1ebf: During the reign of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, a new imperial citadel in Hu\u1ebf was built, largely based on the Chinese Forbidden City in Beijing, and also called the Purple Forbidden City.  However, it still employed many obvious Vietnamese characteristics in its design.  Other imperial structures were built later, such as the outlying tomb of Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh, which used French architectural elements as well.  The tomb of Minh M\u1ea1ng is often considered as one of the most beautiful structures in Hu\u1ebf, situated near a vast lotus pond. Its construction was not completed until after Minh M\u1ea1ng's death. The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it had been destroyed and later turned into rice paddies.  The remaining areas are currently being restored by UNESCO.\nOne Pillar Pagoda: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of Hanoi, its design credited to Emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5.  The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In gratitude and reverence of his dream he ordered the construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents.\nPerfume Pagoda:  The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located in the Perfume Mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese people.  Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself.  Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: \"Heaven's gate\" and \"Hell's gate\".  Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple. The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding areas have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.\n\n\n== Calligraphy ==\n\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using Chinese characters along with ch\u1eef n\u00f4m.  However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, which has proven to be very popular.\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.  On special occasions such as the Lunar New Year, people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).  People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.\n\n\n== Visual arts ==\n\n\n=== Silk painting ===\n\nVietnamese silk painting is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts. Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.\n\n\n=== Woodblock prints ===\n\nA folk art with a long history in Vietnam, Vietnamese woodblock prints have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.  Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is used on wood and pressed on paper.  The process is repeated with different colors.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nPhotographic technology was introduced to Vietnam in the mid 19th century by French and Chinese commercial photographers. Since its introduction a diverse range of photography practices have emerged such as fine art photography, documentary photography, and landscape photography. The development of such practices have been accelerated following \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi, that has resulted in a diversification of funding for artists and increased international exposure.\n\n\n== Performing arts ==\n\n\n=== Traditional music ===\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music is extremely diverse, consisting of many different styles varying from region to region.  Some of the most widely known genres include:\n\nQuan h\u1ecd: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals.\nImperial Court music:  Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times.  When referring specifically to the \"Nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c\" form it includes court music from the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty on to the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty.  It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb.\nCa tr\u00f9: An ancient form of chamber music which originated in the imperial court.  It gradually came to be associated with a geisha-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and bureaucrats who most enjoyed the genre.  It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with prostitution, but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown.  Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by UNESCO as a potential Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\n\n=== Traditional theatre ===\n\nGenres include:\n\nC\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng: A kind of modern folk opera originating in South Vietnam, which utilizes extensive vibrato techniques.  It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles.\nH\u00e1t ch\u00e8o: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca tr\u00f9 which was favored more by scholars and elites.\nH\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng (also known as H\u00e1t b\u1ed9i): A theatre form strongly influenced by Chinese opera, it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known stock characters.\n\n\n=== Traditional dance ===\n\nVietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance.  Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the lion dance.\nIn the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.\n\n\n=== Water puppetry ===\n\nWater puppetry is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.  Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.  Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.\n\n\n== Language arts ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nVietnamese literature is literature, both oral and written, created largely by Vietnamese-speaking people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition.  For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in Classical Chinese. Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m, created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige.  It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ch\u1eef n\u00f4m and when it briefly became the official written script.  While the qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in French Indochina.  By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef.\nSome defining works of literature include The Tale of Kieu by Nguy\u1ec5n Du, and L\u1ee5c V\u00e2n Ti\u00ean by Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u.\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\nPoet H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m, and most of it has been translated into qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef for modern Vietnamese.  Her poetry continues to be widely popular.  Other poets such as the famous Mandarin official Duong Khue had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the Ca tr\u00f9-genre song \"H\u1ed3ng h\u1ed3ng, tuy\u1ebft tuy\u1ebft\".\nMany Vietnamese poems, along with folk \"literature\" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture of Vietnam\nHistory of Vietnam\nVietnamese studies\nCensorship in Vietnam\nLinh Chi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLerner, Martin (1984).

          "Had an amazing morning being guided through every step of the process of making traditional Vietnamese lanterns by the very skilled and knowledgeable staff, even learning some of the history behind the craft. Thank you!!",
          "Very, very talented people displaying their works. We made several small purchases for family and friends. Hope to return next year.",
          "We knew we were going to silk embroidery shop so when we walked in we quickly saw all of the work hanging on the wall. We looked at each other and thought \"Why are they hanging photographs in a silk shop? You would think they would want to hang up their work.\" As we walked",
          "We enjoyed a special afternoon making an authentic lantern at this workshop and the girls there really made it easy for us. Their work is beautiful and we bought several other items as well.",

          "I just loved to participate in this workshop! Highly recommended! They are a small vietnamise family teaching in a very simple way how to make a beautiful lantern. The workshop takes about 2h30 and costs about U$ 17. It was very very good, and even thinking you have no hability",
          "When we were in Hoi An, we stopped at a shop where they were demonstrating how the hand-made lanterns that adorn the streets and homes are made. It was located near the Old House. The Vietnamese believe the hanging lanterns bring lug, happiness and wealth. The lanterns are",
          "So many stores selling handicrafts and tourist trinkets. I think this is one of the better ones. I bought lanterns here that were all reasonably priced and with a good selection and the staff were very helpful without being too pushy. They do put on traditional music/dance shows",
          "We watched a performance of traditional dance and music and enjoyed the lovely costumes and musical instruments. Afterwards the children made lanterns which make a good souvenir. The shop has some very nice gifts - pottery, silk, toiletries... A great spot for indoor",
          "I went to short enjoyable traditional performance, was fun. Entry by using ancient town coupon or free. Also did some lantern making a good laugh and 2 beautiful lanterns to take home. Relaxing fun time",
          "Everything ok. Many jod by hand. Staff friendly. Relax with music traditional and dance. I love lanterns have a picture. And shoes hand made",
          "We very much enjoyed the traditional music and dance that is put on for tourists twice a day. However, if you are sitting near the front please be aware that when you use your phone or tablet to record or photograph the performance, not only is it very distracting for those",
          "Great insight as to the good work that is done...the workshop leads to the store... the prices are not that cheap, but nice to look at and 'window' shop.",
          "Hoi An has lots of handicraft made by artisans and makes great gift especially the silk lanterns or money purses made locally. Just walk the streets and or attend a workshop to learn the beautiful art.",
          "We had already been here previously on a tour of Hoi Ann, before this visit. The standard of workmanship is excellent. The place is rammed full of tour groups as well as people coming in off the street. Prices were ok for a range of goods. Nice to be able to support local",
          "The Handicraft Workshop is a different tourist option on the Old Quarter ticket - something that isn't a museum or historical home. My kids made lanterns for $8 AUD/each - it took them quite some time, and the woman was helpful and patient. Other handicrafts are for sale in the",

          "Yes, it is nice in that you see the actual silk worms in various stages. But the art is not to most Westerner's taste and the prices are not that great. You'll probably end up here if you take a tour and it is somewhat interesting but I'd just spend more time shopping around the",
          "An absolute must if you're interested in taking home authentic handicrafts. The added benefit of buying from here is that you're helping the lives of the people that are working at the store. I bought hand woven placements yesterday that were made by two people with Downs.",

          "Why would I give this place an excellent rating. The reason is this place is large and full of all that makes Hoi An a wonderful place. I have not bought anything here, I treated the place as a 'museum' of what you can expect to see in the Ancient town and give you a rough idea",
          "If you want a memento of your trip, it is worth going in here - there is a wide variety colourful of things.",

          "We bought silks, carvings, shirts and embroidery at this workshop. Needless to say we were impressed by the work.",

          "Walking around to see the process of making silk by cocoon was interesting. i bought some raw silk tie as gifts for my friend and they loved it so much.",
          "I did expect more which is probably my fault. There are far better craft shops in Hoi An. I felt this was a coach them in and coach them out place designed for tourists and stayed for about 10 minutes. Would avoid if time is short",
          "Worth a visit to see the process of silk worm to silk fabric. They show you grubs newly hatched and much older grubs as well as cocoons ready for harvesting. Watching the girls use chopsticks to pick up the cocoons and pull the silk from them was very interesting. Great place",
          "We enjoyed looking at all the awesome handicrafts and art. Some really good silk art and tapestry here.",
          "this is where you can see how silk worms are farmed and then see the silk pictures made or go upstairs and get clothing made for you from the silk. There are other crafts for sale here.",
          "This place has some beautiful items, hand embroidery, silk lanterns,tailors, but it was spoiled by the hard sell from the embroidery side who spoilt our enjoyment with the pressure selling. The assistant was so intrusive we left having purchase nothing.",
          "We used one of our 5 ancient town tickets to get in on our day exploring Hoi An. We arrived at 10 am and timed it well because we got to watch the music/ dance performance which was interesting. We had a little look in the workshop and bought a cheap souvenir, we didn't",
          "Some fantastic work & we were interested in the sewn Silk \"pictures\" but the assistant tried the hard sell and wouldn't let us alone. Without that we have bought something.",
          "This was a neat little place with artisans making items from jewellery to clothing to paintings. Things are reasonably priced for handmade, one of a kind items. Good information on the history of culture in Hoi An.",
          "This is a fantastic shop. There are so many different goodies to buy ranging from jewellery, porcelain, clothing, toys, cushions, bags, paintings and more upstairs. They are all hand made by young people learning a craft to earn an income and the work is superb. Some of the",
          "This is a great place to visit, you shoul come here at 9 a.m or 3.30 pm to enjoy the traditional performance by Hoi An artist. It's amazing !",
          "Catching a traditional Vietnamese music and dance performance at the Hoi An Handicraft Workshop was one of the highlights during our visit to the Ancient City. You are seated very close to the stage and have a great view of both the musicians and dancers... the talented artists",
          "It was amazing to see silk worms and the silk thread they produce. The women doing embroidery are incredible. They try and sell you everything at the end which we dont like. But, we bought three men's ties for $24 and they take dollars happily.",
          "Tourist trap, beautiful products but you just can't buy everywhere you go. The sales girl we had was rare pushy, I think she thought that we must have had a lot of money to spend as she was only showing us the most expense of their items. \"Beautiful but no thank you\".",
          "a short music and dance in traditional format twice a day is well worth the small entry fee. in addition lots of arts and crafts going on in a lovely old building.gets very busy at performance times",
          "If you are on the lookout for something a little different then you will be sure to find something here. Nice place to visit",
          "Upstairs there is a display with real silk worms in the various phases of their life cycle in the production of silk. The children, aged 9,6 and 5 were fascinated. They helped feed the larger worms with mulberry leaves. They were amazed at how small the worms had become after",
          "I was able to have a first hand knowledge of their work. It was amazing to see people with such limited exposure to the world can come up with such meaningful/artful ideas",
          "The folks were very friendly and very patient. The lantern maker has won many awards and his whole family is involved int he endeavor",
          "Interesting cultural performance that reflected the vietnamese way of life with song and dance, comfortable setting. Local tea tasting and lantern making etc.",
          "It took sometime to go through the workshop and admire all the arts and crafts. In particular the embroidery work done was excellent and takes some time to enjoy. There was so much to take in.",
          "This workshop employs highly skilled people with disabilities who produce high quality yet affordable items - silver jewelry, hand sewn items, lovely silk and pottery and porcelain. Definitely the nicest things available.",

          "The handicraft workshop has a performance of local music and dancing every day at 3:00, which is well worth seeing. The workshop itself has a good selection of little shops and you can see people making lanterns, doing embroidery, etc.",
          "We were taken to this shop by the manageress of our hotel because we asked for something unusual to take back home with us. We were completely taken aback at all the goods on the shop, the quality of it and the best thing about it is that it's all hand made. We bought several",
          "Lovely to see ancient crafts being worked and the skill involved, especially those silk pictures. There was one of an old woman and the detail of her face was truly amazing. Unfortunately it was too expensive for me to buy.",
          "I didn't think this was very interesting. A lot of items for sale, mostly. Maybe had we caught a performance, it would have been worthwhile.",
          "Great place to see local people working on handicrafts and then you can but examples of the work in the store front operation. Lovely jewellery - next time I hope they will have silver wirework earings like the pendants that they make.",
          "Saw some workers busily woking on their craft. They seem so engrossed in their work that they do not mind you looking over their shoulders. Good stop and also to avoid the scorching heat outside",
          "It's a small place displaying live art creation, not an easy job. The items made were of real food quality and specially the finishing was fantastic, worth visiting.",
          "A chance to watch the artisans in action creating items that you will see in many Hoi An shops. I was humbled by how proudly the stone carving was demonstrated. Ladies in yellow act as personal shoppers and translators which was very useful. We bought heaps here - jewellery,",
          "On the day I went, there were only three artisans at work (lantern making, embroidery and painting), and I felt there was pressure to purchase items. There was no guide explaining the processes, so it just felt like a normal shop, and if not for the show it would have been a",
          "A visit to what we originally thought was an art gallery turned out to be a very special visit for us. The 'paintings' of Vietnamese fishermen, culture and lifestyle turned out to be silk embroidery. You can watch the ladies hand embroidering the most stunning pictures from a",
          "The workshop had a lot of little pieces of history as well as the different crafts of the area. The host of the workshop tried to sell things to everyone who came in, which got a little old after a few minutes.",
          "Great boutique shopping, with quality hand made crafts all presented beautifully. Homewares, clothes, jewelry, books and more. Fantastic shop, with lots of bits & pieces for sale both downstairs & up. You can see people working their craft out the back of the shop.",
          "Visited as many handicraft workshops as I could travelling in Vietnam and Cambodia. I wanted to contribute in a small way to the help the good work that these workshops provide. The volunteers should be congratulated. Goods are of exceptional quality and are hand made. If",
          "Please do not take this the wrong way, it still has very good work but I believe they are pricing themselves out of the market. When i first went to Vietnam i bought three tapestries and had them framed at home, now to buy one tapestry is more than the cost of the three I",
          "I was lucky enough that someone told me to go to the handicraft house at 10.15 for a concert so I slowly made my way up there and didn't regret it. The house is beautiful and the concert gave a great insight into the different types of dances and music. If you don't have the",
          "With the promise of artisans and money going to folk who needed it, this seemed a good place to go. There was one fellow working in silver, but mainly, this is a store with higher priced, though quality, crafts.",
          "There were some lovely things to buy with proceeds going to needy people.There are also some lovely clothes to buy in the shop that leads on from this store.",
          "Beautiful colored lanterns, taylors everywhere, good silk. Many different kinds of craft for house, traditional objects.",
          "We went to this and got in just in time before a really massive rain storm came, so at least we had shelter! Traditional show was good.",
          "Don't be fooled - you don't really see artisans at work. It's just a front for yet another souvenir shop",
          "There is local music, singing and dancing in colourful costumes in the concert. Be there early to get a good seat in front of the stage (like we did). There are also lanterns galore to see and buy if you want to (we did not buy any as we would not have any use for any - much",
          "We did this as the last clip on our Hoi An city ticket, and I think it was worth it. If you time it right you can see a cultural performance (singing and dancing) which was more enjoyable that I expected - actually, I would say it's worth the clip if you include the performance.",
          "There's a Vietnamese tradtional music concert at 10:15 daily - a must-see in Hoi An given that it doesn't cost anything other than an Old Town ticket. The production values aren't great but it's fun and not too long (less than 30 mins). However, if you're not there when the",
          "The products here are lovely - a bit different from the other shops in Hoi An and definitely worth a visit.",
          "A bit of a con. Nice enough building but on entry you are immediately accosted and marched round various handicraft outlets with expectation that you will buy. Yes there are 1 or 2 artisans making pottery, lampshades or embroidering but we suspect what you buy is mass produced",
          "I have visited before but was a little disappointed this time - not a great selection of items to purchase and nothing unique that really stood out and 'grabbed me'. Given that Hoi An is a tourist paradise with many shops selling exactly the same things, I personally think there",
          "When you are in Hoi An you wish you could stay for ever. Just walk around the streets and enjoy this magic little town. When it was near the New Lunar Year celebration so the streets were decorated with colourful lanterns and at sunset the multicoloured lights were reflected in",
          "This was the top sight accessible with the Old Town Ticket in the historic part of Hoi An. I highly recommend coming for the concerts. The concert included traditional music, dance, singing, opera, etc. We were pleasantly pleased with an authentic, albeit low production",
          "This is a very nice place to visit, with a wide range of products manually crafted by local craftsman. Our group participated in a workshop of making lanterns. You can buy clothing (suit, dress) custom made and delivered to the hotel in the late afternoon. Very professional and",
          "This Shop is amazing!!! It is full of so many little gifts, and beautiful handicrafts.....perfect for everyone. Each piece has been individually crafted by a very talented artisan, who has a disability. There is also NO pressure to buy whilst you look around. We bought so many",
          "The prices are so high comparing to their neiboughers. They want to charge us bouble with the same items and same quality. Should not be back",
          "We bought some amazing gifts from here a brass vase bowl type which you could put a tea light in and it lite up . It has a lid on it and was made by hand and has fine filigree work of roses all over it . Just amazing stuff all done by the handicap people . We bought money clip",
          "Full of great things to buy we bought quite a few things. Like caved figures and animals . There was nothing not to like .",
          "Prices are fixed, no bargaining allowed. Really nice items being produced at the workshop though. Bought a few silk lanterns here, but found the same stuff priced cheaper at another shop later that night. Stayed on to watch the cultural performances, which were a series of",
          "We enjoyed watching the artisans work on all the different crafts which were exhibited and for sale. The afternoon folk concert was an added bonus. We really enjoyed our visit there.",

          "We made it there just in time for the performance at 3.15. The artists are very good and talented and people can sit on little stools and watch the performance. Was a great show, not too long. Lots of things to buy, not overpriced. The lanterns were lovely. So was the pottery",
          "This is a great experience to see the artisans at work, particularly the silk embroidery, which words can't describe how beautiful these pieces of work are. However, it must be noted that this is definitely a tourist shopping trap, and I think really aimed at 'tour groups'.",
          "So much to see and buy. We would have missed this place if it hadn't been pointed out to us by our guide. Lovely silk paintings to buy and you get a quick tour and explanation/demonstration of how the silk worms develop and grow to finally produce the silk thread. Worth a visit!",
          "Enormous choice of lacquers, paintings, and all sorts of stuff you don't need but will buy. Remember you have to carry it home.",
          "Wonderful crafts, the opportunity to watch artisans at work making silk lanterns,pottery, etc. Prices fair, quality excellent. Don't miss the folk performance held 2X a day. Entire cast talented and passionate. It was so worthwhile!",
          "You'll need to purchase an Old Town ticket which allows you to see 5 places in Hoi An. Use a ticket to see the traditional singers, dancers and musicians perform in a 200-year-old Chinese trading house. Performance in morning and afternoon - check times beforehand. Show lasts",
          "Nice shop, friendly owner, good customer service, the price is awesome. I found a lot of interesting products and just kinda wanted to buy all of them lol. You can find very nice birthday presents here too.",
          "loved the dancing fantastic, and the very talented musicians. lampshades would have been a good present but couldnt find space tp pack them..",

          "The handicrafts are pretty good, and seeing how some of it is done is quite interesting, if you\u2019re in the mood.

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "Hoi An ancient town is supposed to be filled with places like this but there really are fairly few places amongst the commercialism. But, this was my favorite house. Actually, none of the houses had tour guides that seemed to care one bit about the house they were supposed to",

          "Not really worth using one of your 5 tickets to go in here unless you have no where else to go. I would rather spend time in the Cantonese Clubhouse or Hainanese clubhouse. Just an old house with very limited access as the descendants are still living in there. So after just",
          "Descendants from years ago still live here. It's one of two oldest houses and worth going inside. The owner will chat to you and tell you a little of her family.",

          "Perhaps it was because we visited late in the day and getting dark that we did not appreciate Duc An Old House as much as Tan Ky Old House. The space here is a bit smaller. The lighting is very poor in the late afternoon and everything seemed so dark. The highlight was",
          "Don't use a ticket here unless you have about 15 of them. Nothing much to see, better places nearby.",
          "So little information came the tourist's way when exploring these places. This old house was really interesting and would have benefited from having a guide. Probably spent about 20 minutes here, which was quite a bit longer than other places we visited. I enjoyed this",
          "Taken here by the guide, great bit of local history comes alive as the 6th generation owner describes his childhood . Well worth a visit but only if your guide can translate",
          "I regretted using one of my tickets here. There really wasn't anything to see and nobody offered any information.",
          "A well maintained property richly decorated with timber carvings, an old world charm and beautiful outdoor area. Family portraits adorn the walls accompanied by Vietnamese paintings. Interesting excursion gives a real insight into traditional vietnamese culture. Need a ticket",
          "it is just an old house with some old furniture and pictures. it has a very unique roof. this some of the old heritage buildling that is now slowly fading away. more need to be done to preserve this old buildings. you just walk around and just admire the building.",
          "Nice place, when you get in the clock goes back! Look fot yourself and enjoy, it will take you maybe 15 minutes!",
          "Tiny place, too busy but nice and clean. Learn that part of the appeal of Duc An\u2019s house is that it\u2019s the only old house in area that makes a genuine effort to present some real history",
          "Nice to look at, but nothing special. Would be better with more information about the house written next to items and pictures. A little shops at the back, and a few interesting bonsai plants.",
          "This Duc An old house does not allow you to go upstairs as it's still occupied by the family. They seem more interested in selling all sorts of trinkets/clothes/pouches. Really takes away the real reason why a tourist would want to visit such an ancient place. Disappointing.",
          "Yes, the house is \"on the tourist trail\", but it just seems commercialised and not really representative of how people would have lived in the oldie houses. There is a good sign on the wall with markings of high floods from earlier years and a little yard/garden to explore.",
          "This is an old Vietnamese house open to the public. We were the only people there. There was little explanation in English for us to understand what was what so we had a short walk around and left. Probably better things to see as one of your 5 Hoi An attraction tickets",
          "Very informative little tour of an authentic house in which the family still live upstairs. Only took about 15 minutes.",
          "A great cultural heritage sight. We were so impressed with all of the old buildings in the area. We would encourage people to get the town pass.",
          "Interesting old building with old carvings that has been used as a bookstall and Chinese medicine dispensary, however no tour or explanation offered and just left to wander at will to gleam out information from the very limited signs that were in English. Disappointing.",
          "We enjoyed checking out Duc An Old House for the lights. The ornately painted lights feature birds, fish, fat guys and more. They are very beautifully painted and our favourite part of this attraction! Check it out!",
          "Very Interesting house to learn some history of early setllers in Hoi an. This house not overrun with travelers/tourist or souvenir sellers so its very calm and peaceful.",
          "Hospitable family welcomes you into their old house, explaining the rich history. Most interesting that the old section of Hanoi always gets flooded, and they have marks on the walls where each year the water reaches. They transport everything, furniture, etc upstairs to avoid",
          "Interesting to see this old house from the chinese period. You will be told a little about the family historie.",
          "Visited after while walking around the Hoi An ancient town. With the ticket you get a small tour and a sample of green tea at the inner court yard. To miss the crowds I would recommend going early morning of late afternoon. Even if you miss the tour the building is quite nice",
          "Stop for a visit and enjoyed the little place and the history. Strolling around just looking at stuff that are a few hundred years old.",
          "Well preserved historical house with beautiful wood details. It has an interesting history, and we were lucky enough to hear a quartet sitting outside playing traditional music in the evening. Worth a visit.",
          "Don't waste your time looking at these two dingy rooms. Absolute rubbish. We walked in. The family was busily going about its day. fine. we walked through one room, then another, then were met with a sign that said \"private.\" i have seen more interesting rooms -- well, just",
          "Typical Vietnamese old house, worth a look, it was quite crowded when we were there , we enjoyed some green tea and a guided tour",

          "This is one of a number of 'Old Houses' in Hoi An which hasn't been updated or modernized for over a hundred years or more. When we visited, an old lady was having her lunch. She was over 90 and had lived there all her life. There were fascinating items of furniture and",
          "The Duc An Old House is a peaceful dwelling that contains many fascinating items which hearken back to Hoi An's past, and is part of its living history as well. The elegant furniture is arrayed for the home's occupants, and one can easily imagine the family + guests taking tea,",
          "Another old historic building. Respect the history but the house is no surprise or cause of excitement.",
          "This house was very interesting to visit. Lots to see, many original pieces of furniture, pictures etc. Don't miss this one.",
          "I think it's quite something to be allowed to walk through someone's private home on any given day. This was one of 2 I saw and I love the beautiful wood work and it gives a taste of what life is like behind the shops and walls. The front shows how these homes are also easily",
          "Of the old houses in Hoi An this is probably the best kept in terms of furniture and historical details. The first part of the house is like a museum of old times, the second part shows family live as it is now.",
          "There is almost no information in English inside the house. It's old and that about it. Nothing that sticks out compared to the other old houses. Maybe it would have been better if a guide could tell you more about the house.",
          "It is a last remaining medicinal shop turned into a museum. The elderly gentleman manning the place who claimed to have lived there was rather grouchy and unfriendly when we wanted to ask for more information about the place. It was a pity, it could have added to the",
          "I do agree with some of the reviews below../ there's not much to see really. You get a glimpse of how Vietnamese used to live in the past in the old houses and that's about it. Spend no longer than 15 minutes!",
          "Not a great deal to see and yet the style of the house and the history behind the design is very interesting. Lots of furnishings from the period.",
          "The guide spoke far too quickly for western visitors so it was very hard to understand her. The furnishings are beautiful and if you have time take a look",
          "The architecture and style were interesting. The place was however, extremely packed, and you could barely hear to actually learn any information about the place. Also, they mostly just try and sell you some overpriced souvenirs. Good for about 15 minutes.",
          "Loved this old house and found its history fascinating.spoke to current owner who told us A little About out his family history and the house. Photographs of his grandfather who was a prominent member of communist Party and who lived to the age of 100. Lots of interesting",
          "Unfortunately this house has had a lot of renovation work and although in the old style not really genuine. However saying that the screens on the posts that look like Chinese characters were amazing. Up close you could see they were lots of birds made from mother of pearl.",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Vietnam (Vietnamese: Vi\u1ec7t Nam pronounced [v\u00ee\u0259t n\u0101\u02d0m] (listen)), officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnamese: C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a X\u00e3 h\u1ed9i ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a Vi\u1ec7t Nam), is the easternmost country on the Southeast Asian Indochinese Peninsula. With an estimated 95.5 million inhabitants as of 2018, it is the 16th most populous country in the world. Vietnam shares its land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares its maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital city is Hanoi, while its most populous city and commercial hub is Ho Chi Minh City, also known by its former name of Saigon.\nArchaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age. The ancient Vietnamese nation was annexed by China in the 2nd century BC, which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium. The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD. This paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded geographically southward until European colonialism in the mid-19th century. Modern Vietnam was born upon the Proclamation of Independence from France in 1945. Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the First Indochina War, which ended in 1954, the nation was divided into two rival states: communist North and anti-communist South. Conflicts intensified in the Vietnam War, which saw extensive US intervention in support of South Vietnam and ended with North Vietnamese victory in 1975.\nAfter North and South Vietnam were reunified as a communist state under a unitary socialist government in 1976, the country became economically and politically isolated until 1986, when the Communist Party initiated a series of economic and political reforms that facilitated Vietnamese integration into world politics and the global economy. As a result of the successful reforms, Vietnam has enjoyed a high GDP growth rate, consistently ranked among the fastest-growing countries in the world. It nevertheless faces challenges including poverty, corruption, inadequate social welfare and a poor human rights record, including increasing persecution of religious groups and human rights advocates and intensifying restrictions on civil liberties. By 2010, Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries. It is a member of such international organisations as the United Nations (UN), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Vi\u1ec7t Nam (Vietnamese pronunciation: [vi\u0259\u0300t na\u02d0m]) is a variation of Nam Vi\u1ec7t (Chinese: \u5357\u8d8a; pinyin: N\u00e1nyu\u00e8; literally \"Southern Vi\u1ec7t\"), a name that can be traced back to the Tri\u1ec7u dynasty of the 2nd century BC. The word Vi\u1ec7t originated as a shortened form of B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t (Chinese: \u767e\u8d8a; pinyin: B\u01ceiyu\u00e8), the name of a group of people then living in southern China and Vietnam. The form \"Vietnam\" (\u8d8a\u5357) is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem S\u1ea5m Tr\u1ea1ng Tr\u00ecnh. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng that dates to 1558. In 1802, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac \u00c1nh (who later became Emperor Gia Long) established the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. In the second year of his rule, he asked the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty to confer on him the title 'King of Nam Viet/Nanyue' (\u5357\u8d8a in Chinese) after seizing power in Annam. The Emperor refused since the name was related to Zhao Tuo's Nanyue, which included the regions of Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China. The Qing Emperor, therefore, decided to call the area \"Viet Nam\" instead. Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long. It was revived in the early 20th century in Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u's History of the Loss of Vietnam, and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQD\u0110). The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when the imperial government in Hu\u1ebf adopted Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age. Homo erectus fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n and Ngh\u1ec7 An provinces in northern Vietnam. The oldest Homo sapiens fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum. Teeth attributed to Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu, Lang Gao and Lang Cuom. By about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-rice cultivation in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the flourishing of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture, notable for its bronze casting used to make elaborate bronze \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n drums. At this point, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of V\u0103n Lang and \u00c2u L\u1ea1c appeared, and the culture's influence spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Maritime Southeast Asia, throughout the first millennium BC.\n\n\n=== Dynastic Vietnam ===\n\nThe H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng dynasty of the H\u00f9ng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first Vietnamese state in the History of Vietnam (then known as X\u00edch Qu\u1ef7 and later V\u0103n Lang). In 257 BC, the last H\u00f9ng king was defeated by Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n. He consolidated the L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t and \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t tribes to form the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c, proclaiming himself An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng. In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo defeated An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and consolidated \u00c2u L\u1ea1c into Nanyue. However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han\u2013Nanyue War. For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule. Early independence movements, such as those of the Tr\u01b0ng Sisters and Lady Tri\u1ec7u, were temporarily successful, though the region gained a longer period of independence as V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n under the Anterior L\u00fd dynasty between AD 544 and 602. By the early 10th century, Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Kh\u00fac family.In AD 938, the Vietnamese lord Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n defeated the forces of the Chinese Southern Han state at B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River and achieved full independence for Vietnam after a millennium of Chinese domination. Renamed \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (Great Viet), the nation enjoyed a golden era under the L\u00fd and Tr\u1ea7n dynasties. During the rule of the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t repelled three Mongol invasions. Meanwhile, the Mah\u0101y\u0101na branch of Buddhism flourished and became the state religion. Following the 1406\u20137 Ming\u2013H\u1ed3 War, which overthrew the H\u1ed3 dynasty, Vietnamese independence was interrupted briefly by the Chinese Ming dynasty, but was restored by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, the founder of the L\u00ea dynasty. The Vietnamese dynasties reached their zenith in the L\u00ea dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of Emperor L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1460\u20131497). Between the 11th and 18th centuries, Vietnam expanded southward in a process known as nam ti\u1ebfn (\"southward expansion\"), eventually conquering the kingdom of Champa and part of the Khmer Empire.From the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of Vietnam. First, the Chinese-supported M\u1ea1c dynasty challenged the L\u00ea dynasty's power. After the M\u1ea1c dynasty was defeated, the L\u00ea dynasty was nominally reinstalled. Actual power, however, was divided between the northern Tr\u1ecbnh lords and the southern Nguy\u1ec5n lords, who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s. During this period, the Nguy\u1ec5n expanded southern Vietnam into the Mekong Delta, annexing the Central Highlands and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta. The division of the country ended a century later when the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers established a new dynasty. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, led by Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, aided by the French. Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh unified Vietnam, and established the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, ruling under the name Gia Long.\n\n\n=== French Indochina ===\n\nIn the 1500s, the Portuguese became acquainted with the Vietnamese coast, where they reportedly erected a stele on the Ch\u00e0m Islands to mark their presence. By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan. After having successfully settled Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau-Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with H\u1ed9i An, where many Portuguese traders and Catholic missionaries set foot in the Vietnamese kingdom. The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Vietnam through the central part of Quinam in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk. Meanwhile, in 1613, the first British attempt to establish contact with H\u1ed9i An failed following a violent incident involving the British East India Company. By 1672 the British managed to establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Ph\u1ed1 Hi\u1ebfn.Between 1615 and 1753, French traders also engaged in trade in the area around \u0110\u00e0ng Trong and actively dispersed missionaries. The Vietnamese kingdom began to feel threatened by continuous Christianisation activities. Following the detention of several missionaries, the French Navy received approval from their government to intervene in Vietnam in 1834, with the aim of freeing imprisoned Catholic missionaries from a kingdom that was perceived as xenophobic. Vietnam's sovereignty was gradually eroded by France, which was aided by the Spanish and large Catholic militias in a series of military conquests between 1859 and 1885.In 1862, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina. By 1884, the entire country had come under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three Vietnamese entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887. The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society. A Western-style system of modern education was developed, and Catholicism was propagated widely. Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in Saigon, and in Hanoi, the colony's capital.\n\nGuerrillas of the royalist C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng movement massacred around a third of Vietnam's Christian population during the colonial period as part of their rebellion against French rule. They were defeated in the 1890s after a decade of resistance by the Catholics in reprisal for their earlier massacres. Another large-scale rebellion, the Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean uprising, was also suppressed heavily. The French developed a plantation economy to promote the export of tobacco, indigo, tea and coffee. However, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and self-government.\n\nA nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders like Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, Phan Ch\u00e2u Trinh, Phan \u0110\u00ecnh Ph\u00f9ng, Emperor H\u00e0m Nghi, and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh fighting or calling for independence. This resulted in the 1930 Y\u00ean B\u00e1i mutiny by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQD\u0110), which the French quashed. The mutiny caused an irreparable split in the independence movement that resulted in many leading members of the organisation becoming communist converts.The French maintained full control over their colonies until World War II, when the war in the Pacific led to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in 1940. Afterwards, the Japanese Empire was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while permitting the pro-Vichy French colonial administration to continue. Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945. This led to the Vietnamese Famine of 1945, which resulted in up to two million deaths.\n\n\n=== First Indochina War ===\n\nIn 1941, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a Communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation. Following the military defeat of Japan and the fall of its puppet Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, anarchy, rioting, and murder were widespread, as Saigon's administrative services had collapsed. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.Earlier, in July 1945, the Allies had decided to divide Indochina at the 16th parallel to allow Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China to receive the Japanese surrender in the north while Britain's Lord Louis Mountbatten received their surrender in the south. The Allies agreed that Indochina still belonged to France.However, as the French were weakened by the German occupation, British-Indian forces together with the remaining Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group were used to maintain order and to help France re-establish control through the 1945\u20131946 War in Vietnam. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh initially chose to take a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with France. He asked the French to withdraw their colonial administrators, and for aid from French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam. However, the Provisional Government of the French Republic did not act on these requests, including the idea of independence, and dispatched the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule. This resulted in the Vi\u1ec7t Minh launching a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946. The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954. The defeat of French colonialists and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 allowed H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.\n\nThe colonial administration was therefore ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 1954 into three countries\u2014Vietnam, and the kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam was further divided into North and South administrative regions at the Demilitarised Zone, roughly along the 17th parallel north, pending elections scheduled for July 1956. A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists. This migration was in large part aided by the United States military through Operation Passage to Freedom. The partition of Vietnam by the Geneva Accords was not intended to be permanent, and stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after elections in 1956. However, in 1955, the southern State of Vietnam's prime minister, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, toppled B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, and proclaimed himself the president of the Republic of Vietnam. At that point the internationally recognised State of Vietnam effectively ceased to exist and was replaced by the Republic of Vietnam in the south\u2013 supported by the United States, France, Laos, Republic of China and Thailand\u2013 and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north\u2013 supported by the Soviet Union, Sweden, Khmer Rouge, and the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n=== Vietnam War ===\n\nBetween 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political repression. During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500. In the South, Di\u1ec7m countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political re-education centres\". This program incarcerated many non-communists, although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time. The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957. The pro-Hanoi Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Di\u1ec7m's government. From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.\n\nIn 1963, Buddhist discontent with Di\u1ec7m's Catholic regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown. This led to the collapse of Di\u1ec7m's relationship with the United States, and ultimately to a 1963 coup in which he and Nhu were assassinated. The Di\u1ec7m era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u took control in mid-1965. Thi\u1ec7u gradually outmaneuvered K\u1ef3 and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971. During this political instability, the communists began to gain ground. To support South Vietnam's struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States began increasing its contribution of military advisers, using the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident as a pretext for such intervention. US forces became involved in ground combat operations by 1965, and at their peak several years later, numbered more than 500,000. The US also engaged in a sustained aerial bombing campaign. Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant materiel aid and 15,000 combat advisers. Communist forces supplying the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng carried supplies along the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail, which passed through the Kingdom of Laos.The communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 T\u1ebft Offensive. Although the campaign failed militarily, it shocked the American establishment and turned US public opinion against the war. During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Hu\u1ebf. A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4 million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974\u2014over half the result of US and South Vietnamese military actions. Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s. This process also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilise South Vietnam. Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973. In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. South Vietnam was ruled by a provisional government for almost eight years while under military occupation by North Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Reunification and reforms ===\n\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam. The war left Vietnam devastated, with the total death toll between 966,000 and 3.8 million. In the aftermath of the war, under L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears. However, up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to re-education camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour. The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories. In 1978, responding to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, who had been invading and massacring Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Ki\u00ean Giang, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh. The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989. This action, however, worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge. China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust towards the Chinese government began to escalate.At the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the \"old guard\" government with new leadership. The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh, who became the party's new general secretary. Linh and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms known as \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi (\"Renovation\") which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a \"socialist-oriented market economy\". Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation, and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries. The Vietnamese economy subsequently achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports, and foreign investment, although these reforms also caused a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8\u00b0 and 24\u00b0N, and the longitudes 102\u00b0 and 110\u00b0E. It covers a total area of approximately 331,212 km2 (127,882 sq mi). The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long. At its narrowest point in the central Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north. Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%. Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, and tropical forests cover around 42%. The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits. The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point. It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year. The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) in the South China Sea.\n\nSouthern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land. The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation. Several minor earthquakes have been recorded in the past. Most have occurred near the northern Vietnamese border in the provinces of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean, L\u00e0o Cai and S\u01a1n La, while some have been recorded offshore of the central part of the country. The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi P\u0103ng), which is located in L\u00e0o Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high. From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c is the largest. The Hang S\u01a1n \u0110o\u00f2ng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba B\u1ec3 Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDue to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region. During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture. The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north. Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between 21 and 35 \u00b0C (69.8 and 95.0 \u00b0F) over the year. In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33 \u00b0C (59.0 and 91.4 \u00b0F). Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 3 \u00b0C (37.4 \u00b0F) in December and January to 37 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F) in July and August. Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from 1,500 mm (59 in) to 2,000 mm (79 in) during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems. The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons. Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nAs the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity. This was noted in the country's National Environmental Condition Report in 2005. It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species. 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic. Vietnam's fauna includes: 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians. 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic. Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites, the H\u1ea1 Long Bay and Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng National Park together with nine biosphere reserves including: C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd Mangrove Forest, C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean, C\u00e1t B\u00e0, Ki\u00ean Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Ngh\u1ec7 An, C\u00e0 Mau and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park.\n\nVietnam is also home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish. In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam. Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant. In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park. However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010. In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species. The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nIn Vietnam, wildlife poaching has become a major concern. In 2000, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Education for Nature - Vietnam was  founded to instill in the population the importance of wildlife conservation in the country. In the years that followed, another NGO called GreenViet was formed by Vietnamese youngsters for the enforcement of wildlife protection. Through collaboration between the NGOs and local authorities, many local poaching syndicates were crippled by their leaders' arrests. A study released in 2018 revealed Vietnam is a destination for the illegal export of rhinoceros horns from South Africa due to the demand for them as a medicine and a status symbol.The main environmental concern that persists in Vietnam today is the legacy of the use of the chemical herbicide Agent Orange, which continues to cause birth defects and many health problems in the Vietnamese population. In the southern and central areas affected most by the chemical's use during the Vietnam War, nearly 4.8 million Vietnamese people have been exposed to it and suffered from its effects. In 2012, approximately 50 years after the war, the US began a US$43 million joint clean-up project in the former chemical storage areas in Vietnam to take place in stages. Following the completion of the first phase in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng in late 2017, the US announced its commitment to clean other sites, especially in the heavily impacted site of Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a, which is four times larger than the previously treated site, at an estimated cost of $390 million.\n\nThe Vietnamese government spends over VN\u011010 trillion each year ($431.1 million) for monthly allowances and the physical rehabilitation of victims of the chemicals. In 2018, the Japanese engineering group Shimizu Corporation, working with Vietnamese military, built a plant for the treatment of soil polluted by Agent Orange. Plant construction costs were funded by the company itself. One of the long-term plans to restore southern Vietnam's damaged ecosystems is through the use of reforestation efforts. The Vietnamese government began doing this at the end of the war. It started by replanting mangrove forests in the Mekong Delta regions and in C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd outside H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City, where mangroves are important to ease (though not eliminate) flood conditions during monsoon seasons.Apart from herbicide problems, arsenic in the ground water in the Mekong and Red River Deltas has also become a major concern.  And most notoriously, unexploded ordnances (UXO) pose dangers to humans and wildlife\u2014another bitter legacy from the long wars. As part of the continuous campaign to demine/remove UXOs, several international bomb removal agencies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and the US have been providing assistance. The Vietnam government spends over VN\u01101 trillion ($44 million) annually on demining operations and additional hundreds of billions of \u0111\u1ed3ng for treatment, assistance, rehabilitation, vocational training and resettlement of the victims of UXOs. In 2017 the Chinese government also removed 53,000 land mines and explosives left over from the war between the two countries, in an area of 18.4 km2 (7.1 sq mi) in the Chinese province of Yunnan bordering the China\u2013Vietnam border.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nVietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia. Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, with The Economist characterising its leadership as \"ardently capitalist communists\". Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country's politics and society. The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy.\n\nThe general secretary of the CPV performs numerous key administrative functions, controlling the party's national organisation. The prime minister is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of five deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions. Only political organisations affiliated with or endorsed by the CPV are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam. These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.\n\nThe National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral state legislature composed of 498 members. Headed by a chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly. The Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, headed by a chief justice, is the country's highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly. Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and many local courts. Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of national security. Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties. Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc. Despite these differences, Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence. These include the 11th-century patriotic poem \"Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\u00e0\" and the 1428 proclamation of independence \"B\u00ecnh Ng\u00f4 \u0111\u1ea1i c\u00e1o\". Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea. Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO). It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations. As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries.Vietnam's current foreign policy is to consistently implement a policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, co-operation, and development, as well openness and diversification/multilateralisation with international relations. The country declares itself a friend and partner of all countries in the international community, regardless of their political affiliation, by actively taking part in international and regional cooperative development projects. Since the 1990s, Vietnam has taken several key steps to restore diplomatic ties with Western countries. Relations with the United States began improving in August 1995 with both nations upgrading their liaison offices to embassy status. As diplomatic ties between the two nations grew, the United States opened a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City while Vietnam opened its consulate in San Francisco. Full diplomatic relations were also restored with New Zealand, which opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995; Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. Pakistan also reopened its embassy in Hanoi on October 2000, with Vietnam reopening its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005. In May 2016, US President Barack Obama further normalised relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Civil Defence Force. The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Defence Force and the Vietnam Coast Guard. The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000. In 2015, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4 billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending. Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei, India, Japan, Laos, Russia, Singapore and the US. In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nVietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: t\u1ec9nh, from the Chinese \u7701, sh\u011bng). There are also five municipalities (th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 tr\u1ef1c thu\u1ed9c trung \u01b0\u01a1ng), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.\n\nThe provinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities (th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 tr\u1ef1c thu\u1ed9c t\u1ec9nh), townships (th\u1ecb x\u00e3) and counties (huy\u1ec7n), which are in turn subdivided into towns (th\u1ecb tr\u1ea5n) or communes (x\u00e3). The centrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts (qu\u1eadn) and counties, which are further subdivided into wards (ph\u01b0\u1eddng).\n\n\n=== Human rights and sociopolitical issues ===\n\nUnder the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed. Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer L\u00ea C\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ecbnh was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested. Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience.Vietnam is predominantly a source country for trafficked persons who are exploited for labor. A number of citizens, primarily women and girls, from all ethnic groups in Vietnam and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Vietnam.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThroughout the history of Vietnam, its economy has been based largely on agriculture\u2014primarily wet rice cultivation. Bauxite, an important material in the production of aluminium, is mined in central Vietnam. Since reunification, the country's economy is shaped primarily by the CPV through Five Year Plans decided upon at the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses. The collectivisation of farms, factories, and capital goods was carried out as part of the establishment of central planning, with millions of people working for state enterprises. Despite strict state control, Vietnam's economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction. With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States, Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development.\n\nIn 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the CPV introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi reform program. Private ownership began to be encouraged in industry, commerce and agriculture and state enterprises were restructured to operate under market constraints. This led to the five-year economic plans being replaced by the socialist-oriented market mechanism. As a result of these reforms, Vietnam achieved approximately 8% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1990 and 1997. The United States ended its economic embargo against Vietnam in early 1994. Despite the 1997 Asian financial crisis affecting Vietnam by causing an economic slowdown to 4\u20135% growth per annum, its economy began to recover in 1999, with growth at an annual rate of around 7% from 2000 to 2005 making it one of the world's fastest growing economies. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), growth remained strong even in the face of the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010, although Vietnam's year-on-year inflation rate hit 11.8% in December 2010 with the country's currency, the Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng being devalued three times.\n\nDeep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India and the Philippines. This decline can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality. These policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi program, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare. Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets. Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy. Though Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is currently the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia with a total 2011 output of 318,000 barrels per day (50,600 m3/d). In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the eighth-largest crude petroleum producer in the Asia and Pacific region. The United States purchased the highest amount of Vietnam's exports, while goods from China were the most popular Vietnamese import.According to a December 2005 forecast by Goldman Sachs, the Vietnamese economy will become the world's 21st-largest by 2025, with an estimated nominal GDP of $436 billion and a nominal GDP per capita of $4,357. Based on findings by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2012, the unemployment rate in Vietnam stood at 4.46%. That same year, Vietnam's nominal GDP reached US$138 billion, with a nominal GDP per capita of $1,527. The HSBC also predicted that Vietnam's total GDP would surpass those of Norway, Singapore and Portugal by 2050. Another forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2008 stated Vietnam could be the fastest-growing of the world's emerging economies by 2025, with a potential growth rate of almost 10% per annum in real dollar terms. Apart from the primary sector economy, tourism has contributed significantly to Vietnam's economic growth with 7.94 million foreign visitors recorded in 2015.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAs a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products. It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s. Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee. The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other nations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products. Agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nIn 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP. Since the dynastic era, Vietnamese scholars have developed many academic fields especially in social sciences and humanities. Vietnam has a millennium-deep legacy of analytical histories, such as the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0 of Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean. Vietnamese monks, led by the abdicated Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng, developed the Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m Zen branch of philosophy in the 13th century. Arithmetic and geometry have been widely taught in Vietnam since the 15th century, using the textbook \u0110\u1ea1i th\u00e0nh to\u00e1n ph\u00e1p by L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh. L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh introduced Vietnam to the notion of zero, while M\u1ea1c Hi\u1ec3n T\u00edch used the term s\u1ed1 \u1ea9n (Eng: \"unknown/secret/hidden number\") to refer to negative numbers. Furthermore, Vietnamese scholars produced numerous encyclopaedias, such as L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n's V\u00e2n \u0111\u00e0i lo\u1ea1i ng\u1eef.\nIn modern times, Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics. Ho\u00e0ng T\u1ee5y pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century, while Ng\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms. Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight program especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018. Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model. One of Vietnam's main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by V\u01b0\u01a1ng Quang Kh\u1ea3i, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country's largest information technology service company, the FPT Group.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Vietnam devoted 0.19% of its GDP to science research and development in 2011. Between 2005 and 2014, the number of Vietnamese scientific publications recorded in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science increased at a rate well above the average for Southeast Asia, albeit from a modest starting point. Publications focus mainly on life sciences (22%), physics (13%) and engineering (13%), which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding. Almost 77% of all papers published between 2008 and 2014 had at least one international co-author. The autonomy which Vietnamese research centres have enjoyed since the mid-1990s has enabled many of them to operate as quasi-private organisations, providing services such as consulting and technology development. Some have 'spun off' from the larger institutions to form their own semi-private enterprises, fostering the transfer of public sector science and technology personnel to these semi-private establishments. One comparatively new university, the T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng University which was built in 1997, has already set up 13 centres for technology transfer and services that together produce 15% of university revenue. Many of these research centres serve as valuable intermediaries bridging public research institutions, universities, and firms.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is an important element of economic activity in the country, contributing 7.5% of the gross domestic product. Vietnam welcomed over 12.9 million visitors in 2017, an increase of 29.1% over the previous year, making it one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in recent years. The vast majority of visitors in 2017, 9.7 million,  came from Asia. China (4 million), South Korea (2.6 million) and Japan (798,119) made up half of all international arrivals in 2017. Vietnam also attracts large numbers of visitors from Europe with almost 1.9 million visitors in 2017. Russia (574,164) and the United Kingdom (283,537), followed closely by France (255,396) and Germany (199,872) were the largest source of international arrivals from Europe. Other significant international arrivals by nationality include the United States (614,117) and Australia (370,438).The most visited destinations in Vietnam are Ho Chi Minh City with 5.8 million international arrivals, followed by Hanoi with 4.6 million and H\u1ea1 Long, including H\u1ea1 Long Bay with 4.4 million arrivals. All three are ranked in the top 100 most visited cities in the world. Vietnam is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia. In 2018, Travel + Leisure ranked H\u1ed9i An as one of the world's top 15 best destinations to visit.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports. It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam. Vietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level. In 2010, Vietnam's road system had a total length of about 188,744 kilometres (117,280 mi) of which 93,535 kilometres (58,120 mi) are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads. The length of the national road system is about 15,370 kilometres (9,550 mi) with 15,085 kilometres (9,373 mi) of its length paved. The provincial road system has around 27,976 kilometres (17,383 mi) of paved roads while 50,474 kilometres (31,363 mi) district roads are paved.\n\nBicycles, motorcycles and motor scooters remain the most popular forms of road transport in the country, a legacy of the French, though the number of privately owned cars has been increasing in recent years. Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population. Road accidents remain the major safety issue of Vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people losing their lives daily. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City especially with the growth of individual car ownership. Vietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, a distance of nearly 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi). From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north, and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to H\u1ea1 Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean, and the northeast line from Hanoi to L\u00e0o Cai. In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway\u2014shinkansen (bullet train)\u2014using Japanese technology. Vietnamese engineers were sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains. The planned railway will be a 1,545 kilometres (960 mi)-long express route serving a total of 23 stations, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with 70% of its route running on bridges and through tunnels. The trains will travel at a maximum speed of 350 kilometres (220 mi) per hour. Plans for the high-speed rail line, however, have been postponed after the Vietnamese government decided to prioritise the development of both the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City metros and expand road networks instead.\n\nVietnam operates 20 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Son Nhat is the nation's largest airport handling the majority of international passenger traffic. According to a state-approved plan, Vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2025 including: Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, Can Tho International Airport, and Long Thanh International Airport. The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2025. Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 86 passenger aircraft and aims to operate 170 by 2020. Several private airlines also operate in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Bamboo Airways, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air. As a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including: Cam Ranh, \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng, Ho Chi Minh City, H\u1ea1 Long, Qui Nh\u01a1n, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1eeda L\u00f2 and Nha Trang. Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers plays a key role in rural transportation with over 47,130 kilometres (29,290 mi) of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nVietnam's energy sector is dominated largely by the nationwide Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN). As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country's power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW. Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (BOT) investors.Most of Vietnam's power is generated by either hydropower or fossil fuel power such as coal, oil and gas, while diesel, small hydropower and renewable energy supplies the balance. The Vietnamese government had planned to develop a nuclear reactor as the path to establish another source for electricity from nuclear power. The plan was abandoned in late 2016 when a majority of the National Assembly voted to oppose the project due to widespread public concern over  radioactive contamination.The household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nh\u01a1n Tr\u1ea1ch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Ph\u00fa Qu\u00fd Wind Power Plant (6 MW), H\u1ee7a Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and V\u0169ng \u00c1ng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).According to statistics from British Petroleum (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic meters (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Telecommunication ===\n\nTelecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company. The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986. The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it  owned by VNPT. VNPT's monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree. By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone. The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone. With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nVietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m\u00b3. The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge. Most of the country's urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years. Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse. Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed. It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply. There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems. Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources. Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water.In recent years, there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to develop access to safe water in the country by introducing water filtration systems. There is a growing concern among local populations over the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well as the high levels of arsenic in groundwater sources. The government of Netherlands has been providing aid focusing its investments mainly on water-related sectors including water treatment projects. Regarding sanitation, 78% of Vietnam's population has access to \"improved\" sanitation\u201494% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. However, there are still about 21 million people in the country lacking access to \"improved\" sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015. In 2018, the construction ministry said the country's water supply, and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and information technology (IT) to sanitation issues but faced problems like limited funding, climate change, and pollution. The health ministry has also announced that water inspection units will be established nationwide beginning in June 2019. Inspections are to be conducted without notice since there have been many cases involving health issues caused by poor or polluted water supplies as well unhygienic conditions reported every year.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nBy 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources. In 2016, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births. Despite these improvements, malnutrition is still common in rural provinces. Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level. After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established. In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry. The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today. For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam's land being defoliated.Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria. The malaria mortality rate fell to about five percent of its 1990s equivalent by 2005 after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) cases, however, are on the rise. TB has become the second most infectious disease in the country after respiratory-related illness. With an intensified vaccination program, better hygiene and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and new TB infections. In 2004, government subsidies covering about 15% of health care expenses. That year, the United States announced Vietnam would be one of 15 nations to receive funding as part of its global AIDS relief plan. By the following year, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); 9,554 have died. The actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher. On average between 40\u201350 new infections are reported daily in the country. In 2007, 0.4% of the population was estimated to be infected with HIV and the figure has remained stable since 2005. More global aid is being delivered through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to fight the spread of the disease in the country. In September 2018, the Hanoi People's Committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating dog and cat meat as it can cause diseases like rabies and leptospirosis. More than 1,000 stores in the capital city of Hanoi were found to be selling both meats. The decision prompted positive comments among Vietnamese on social media, though some noted that the consumption of dog meat will remain an ingrained habit among many people.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions. General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities. A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008. Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country's education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government. Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance. Regardless, Vietnam's school enrolment is among the highest in the world. The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005. In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them.Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education. A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (USA) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia). The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics. In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval. The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2018, the population of Vietnam stands at approximately 95.5 million people. The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million. According to the 2019 census, the country's population was 96,208,984. Based on the 2019 census, 65.6% of the Vietnamese population are living in rural areas while only 34.4% live in urban areas. The average growth rate of the urban population has recently increased which is attributed mainly to migration and rapid urbanisation. The dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constitute 82,085,826 people or 85.32% of the population. Most of their population is concentrated in the country's alluvial deltas and coastal plains. As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country. Despite this, Vietnam is also home to 54 other ethnic minority groups, including the Hmong, Dao, T\u00e0y, Thai and N\u00f9ng. Many ethnic minorities such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh, dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.Other uplanders in the north migrated from southern China between the 1300s and 1800s. Since the partition of Vietnam, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including over 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas. The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders. Throughout Vietnam's history, many Chinese people, largely from South China, migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees. Since the reunification in 1976 an increase of communist policies nationwide resulted in the nationalisation and confiscation of property especially from the Hoa in the south and the wealthy in cities. This led many of them to leave Vietnam. Furthermore, with the deterioration of Sino-Vietnamese relations after the border invasion by Chinese government in 1979 many Vietnamese were wary of Chinese government's intentions. This indirectly caused more Hoa people in the north to leave the country.\n\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\n\nThe number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%). Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi economic program, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights. As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively. The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census. Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate. Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.\n\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%. In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009. In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.Many Vietnamese use mopeds for transportation since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013. With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water. An example is the 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster caused by the Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Company illegally discharging toxic industrial waste into the ocean. This killed many fish and destroyed marine habitats in Vietnamese waters resulting in major losses to the country's economy. The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for waste handling by factories. Although the authorities also have schedules for collecting different types of waste, waste disposal is another problem caused by urbanisation. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government's efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort household waste since waste sorting is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nUnder Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy freedom of belief and religion. All religions are equal before the law and each place of worship is protected under Vietnamese state law. Religious beliefs cannot be misused to undermine state law and policies. According to a 2007 survey 81% of  Vietnamese people did not believe in a god. Based on government findings in 2009, the number of religious people increased by 932,000. The latest official statistics, presented by the Vietnamese government to the United Nations special rapporteur in 2014, indicate the overall number of followers of recognised religions is about 24 million of a total population of almost 90 million. Formally recognised religious communities include: 11 million Buddhists, 6.2 million Catholics, 1.4 million Protestants, 4.4 million Caodaisms followers, 1.3 million Hoahaoism Buddhists as well as 75,000 Muslims, 7,000 Baha'\u00eds and 1,500 Hindus.Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the dominant branch of Buddhism among the Kinh majority who follow the religion, while Therav\u0101da is practised in almost entirely by the Khmer minority. About 7% of the population is Christian\u2014made up of six million Roman Catholics and one million Protestants. Catholicism was introduced to Vietnam in the 16th century and was firmly established by Jesuits missionaries (mainly Portuguese and Italian) from nearby Portuguese Macau and Malacca, and from remnants of persecuted Japanese Catholics in the 17th centuries. French missionaries (from the Paris Foreign Missions Society) aided by Spanish missionaries (Dominicans) from neighbouring Spanish East Indies towards Tonkin actively sought converts in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. A significant number of Vietnamese people are also adherents of Caodaism, an indigenous folk religion, which has structured itself on the model of the Catholic Church together with another Buddhist section of Hoahaoism. Protestantism was only recently spread by American and Canadian missionaries throughout the modern civil war, where it was largely accepted among the highland Montagnards of South Vietnam. The largest Protestant churches are the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) and the Evangelical Church of Vietnam North (ECVN). Around 770,000 of the country's Protestants are members of ethnic minorities. Although it is one of the country's minority religions, and has a briefer history than Catholicism, Protestantism is the country's fastest-growing religion, expanding at a rate of 600% in recent decades. Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam, these include: Bani, Sunni and non-denominational sections of Islam which is  practised primarily among the ethnic Cham minority. There are also a few Kinh adherents of Islam, other minority adherents of Baha'i, as well as Hindus among the Cham's.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe national language of the country is Vietnamese (ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t), a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon\u2013Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population. In its early history, Vietnamese writing used Chinese characters (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n) before a different meaning set of Chinese characters known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m developed between the 7th\u201313th century. The folk epic Truy\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec1u (The Tale of Kieu, originally known as \u0110o\u1ea1n tr\u01b0\u1eddng t\u00e2n thanh) by Nguy\u1ec5n Du was written in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. Ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, the Romanised Vietnamese alphabet, was developed in the 17th century by Jesuit missionaries such as Francisco de Pina and Alexandre de Rhodes by using the alphabets of the Romance languages, particularly the Portuguese alphabet, which later became widely used through Vietnamese institutions during the French colonial period. Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: T\u00e0y, M\u01b0\u1eddng, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, N\u00f9ng and Hmong. The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families. In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.\n\nThe French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among the older generation and those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce. Vietnam remains a full member of the International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie) and education has revived some interest in the language. Russian, and to a lesser extent German, Czech and Polish are known among some northern Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. With improved relations with Western countries and recent reforms in Vietnamese administration, English has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of English is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of French. The popularity of Japanese and Korean has also grown as the country's ties with other East Asian nations have strengthened.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nVietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base. Some elements of the nation's culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy. Vietnamese society is structured around l\u00e0ng (ancestral villages); all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month. The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture. Despite this, there is are Chinatowns in the south, such as in Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them. In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture. In recent centuries, Western cultures have become popular among recent generations of Vietnamese.\n\nThe traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are based on humanity (nh\u00e2n ngh\u0129a) and harmony (h\u00f2a) in which family and community values are highly regarded. Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols, such as the Vietnamese dragon which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery; Vietnam's national father, L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n is depicted as a holy dragon. The l\u1ea1c is a holy bird representing Vietnam's national mother \u00c2u C\u01a1. Other prominent images that are also revered are the turtle, buffalo and horse. Many Vietnamese also believe in the supernatural and spiritualism where illness can be brought on by a curse or sorcery or caused by non-observance of a religious ethic. Traditional medical practitioners, amulets and other forms of spiritual protection and religious practices may be employed to treat the ill person. In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programs. For many decades, foreign cultural influences, especially those of Western origin, were shunned. But since the recent reformation, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to neighbouring Southeast Asian, East Asian as well to Western culture and media.The main Vietnamese formal dress, the \u00e1o d\u00e0i is worn for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals. White \u00e1o d\u00e0i is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across the country. Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include: the \u00e1o t\u1ee9 th\u00e2n, a four-piece woman's dress; the \u00e1o ng\u0169, a form of the th\u00e2n in five-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the y\u1ebfm, a woman's undergarment; the \u00e1o b\u00e0 ba, rural working \"pyjamas\" for men and women; the \u00e1o g\u1ea5m, a formal brocade tunic for government receptions; and the \u00e1o the, a variant of the \u00e1o g\u1ea5m worn by grooms at weddings. Traditional headwear includes the standard conical n\u00f3n l\u00e1 and the \"lampshade-like\" n\u00f3n quai thao. In tourism, a number of popular cultural tourist destinations include the former Imperial City of Hu\u1ebf, the World Heritage Sites of Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng National Park, H\u1ed9i An and M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n, coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of H\u1ea1 Long Bay and the Marble Mountains.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six\u2013to-eight-verse poetic form called ca dao which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes. Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ng\u00f4 dynasty, with notable ancient authors including: Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, Nguy\u1ec5n Du and Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u. Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as h\u00e1t n\u00f3i in ca tr\u00f9. Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the tao \u0111\u00e0n. Vietnamese literature has been influenced by Western styles in recent times, with the first literary transformation movement of th\u01a1 m\u1edbi emerging in 1932. Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms. It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed). Folk literature usually exists in many versions, passed down orally, and has unknown authors. Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life. They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n and \u00c2u C\u01a1), culture heroes (S\u01a1n Tinh and Th\u1ee7y Tinh) which are referred to as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions. Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal. The origins of Vietnamese classical music can be traced to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe. Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition along with those of Japan, Korea and Mongolia. Nh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c is the most popular form of imperial court music, Ch\u00e8o is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, while X\u1ea9m or h\u00e1t x\u1ea9m (x\u1ea9m singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music. Quan h\u1ecd (alternate singing) is popular in the former H\u00e0 B\u1eafc Province (which is now divided into B\u1eafc Ninh and B\u1eafc Giang Provinces) and across Vietnam. Another form of music called H\u00e1t ch\u1ea7u v\u0103n or h\u00e1t v\u0103n is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies. Nh\u1ea1c d\u00e2n t\u1ed9c c\u1ea3i bi\u00ean is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s, while ca tr\u00f9 (also known as h\u00e1t \u1ea3 \u0111\u00e0o) is a popular folk music. H\u00f2 can be thought of as the southern style of Quan h\u1ecd. There is a range of traditional instruments, including the \u0111\u00e0n b\u1ea7u (a monochord zither), the \u0111\u00e0n g\u00e1o (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the \u0111\u00e0n nguy\u1ec7t (a two-stringed fretted moon lute). In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music\u2014especially folk music\u2014with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles.Bolero music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style\u2014a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements. However, the modern Vietnamese music industry, known as V-pop, is making its mark in the entertainment field. Many Vietnamese artists have started to collaborate with foreign artists and producers, especially South Korean, to facilitate the entrance of K-pop into the Vietnamese market while also promoting V-pop overseas. For example, in 2014, the South Korean seven-member boy band BTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) collaborated with Vietnamese singer Thanh B\u00f9i on the single called \"Danger\". In 2018, South Korean artist and idol Park Ji-yeon (\ubc15\uc9c0\uc5f0) collaborated with Soobin Ho\u00e0ng S\u01a1n on two versions of the title track called \"Between Us\" (Vietnamese: \u0110\u1eb9p Nh\u1ea5t L\u00e0 Em; Korean: \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774) to promote the two countries\u2019 partnership in terms of the music industry. V Live, which is a South Korean live video streaming service, also collaborated with RBW Entertainment Vietnam (a subsidiary of the Korean entertainment company) to produce Vietnamese-based shows. V Live also launched special monthly mini-concerts called \"V Heartbeat Live\" to connect V-pop and K-pop idols. South Korean entertainment company SM Entertainment signed an agreement with IPP Group to move into the country's market and promote joint business. The company held its 2018 Global Audition in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in search for new talents among the Vietnamese youth.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" (Vietnamese: ng\u0169 v\u1ecb): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth). Common ingredients include: fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime and basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide. The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past. Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country. Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n (salad roll), b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n (rice noodle roll), b\u00fan ri\u00eau (rice vermicelli soup) and ph\u1edf noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants. Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices. Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include: c\u00e0 ph\u00ea \u0111\u00e1 (Vietnamese iced coffee), c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u1ee9ng (egg coffee), chanh mu\u1ed1i (salted pickled lime juice), c\u01a1m r\u01b0\u1ee3u (glutinous rice wine), n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u00eda (sugarcane juice) and tr\u00e0 sen (Vietnamese lotus tea).\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication. It is generally perceived that the country media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken. The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"Bamboo Firewall\". The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\", while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\". Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked.\n\n\n=== Holidays and festivals ===\n\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays. These include: New Year's Day on 1 January; Vietnamese New Year (T\u1ebft) from the last day of the last lunar month to fifth day of the first lunar month; Hung Kings Commemorations on the 10th day of the third lunar month; Reunification Day on 30 April; International Workers' Day on 1 May; and National Day Celebration on 2 September. During T\u1ebft, many Vietnamese from the major cities will return to their villages for family reunions and to pray for dead ancestors. Older people will usually give the young a l\u00ec x\u00ec (red envelope) while special holiday food, such as b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng (rice cake) in a square shape together with variety of dried fruits, are presented in the house for visitors. Many other festivals are celebrated throughout the seasons, including the Lantern Festival (T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean Ti\u00eau), Mid-Autumn Festival (T\u1ebft Trung Thu) and various temple and nature festivals. In the highlands, Elephant Race Festivals are held annually during the spring; riders will ride their elephants for about 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and the winning elephant will be given sugarcane. Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular and are often celebrated by expatriate Vietnamese in Western countries. In Vietnam, wedding dress has been influenced by Western styles, with the wearing of white wedding dresses and black jackets; however, there are also many who still prefer to choose Vietnamese traditional wedding costumes for traditional ceremonies.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe Vovinam, kim ke and b\u00ecnh \u0111\u1ecbnh martial arts are widespread in Vietnam, while football is the country's most popular sport. Its national team won the ASEAN Football Championship twice in 2008 and 2018 and reached the quarter-finals of 2019 AFC Asian Cup, its junior team of under-23 became the runners-up of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship and reached fourth place in 2018 Asian Games, while the under-20 managed to qualify the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time in their football history. The national football women's team also traditionally dominates the Southeast Asian Games, along with its chief rival, Thailand. Other Western sports such as badminton, tennis, volleyball, ping-pong and chess are also widely popular. Vietnam has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1952, when it competed as the State of Vietnam. After the partition of the country in 1954, only South Vietnam competed in the games, sending athletes to the 1956 and 1972 Olympics. Since the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, it has competed as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, attending every Summer Olympics from 1988 onwards. The present Vietnam Olympic Committee was formed in 1976 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979. Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games. In 2016, Vietnam won their first gold medal at the Olympics. By the 2020s, Vietnam will host the inaugural Formula One Vietnam Grand Prix in the city of Hanoi. Basketball has become an increasingly popular sport in Vietnam, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Soc Trang.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndex of Vietnam-related articles\nOutline of Vietnam\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n==== Print ====\n\n\n==== Legislation, case law and government source ====\n\n\n==== Academic publications ====\n\n\n==== News and magazines ====\n\n\n==== Websites ====\n\n\n==== Free content ====\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nVietnam profile from BBC News\n\"Vietnam\".

          "I saw the performance because it was part of my package tour of H\u1ed9i An. It's a cute little theatre venue in the center of the town. It started at 4pm if I remember well and lasted about half an hour. Not too long a show and yet you get a taste of Vietnamese culture: music and",
          "This was such a wonderful show of dance and music. You would never even know it\u2019s here but well worth the time. Plus it\u2019s cool inside.",
          "A nice little theater set up for this half hour traditional dance and music show. Great use of one of the old town 5 tickets. Gives a nice impression of the culture (and having seen dances in Cambodia,Thailand and Indonesia) and connection to the other South Asian cultures.",
          "This show which is very short, 30 minutes, gives an excellent insight into Asian culture with music, singing and dance. The seating for the show is rather cramped but it is certainly worth a visit. Some of the costumes worn by the performers are beautiful. This place is one",
          "I took in the art performance show at 4:15PM which was entertaining, a good experience, and worth the time. The show is only 30 minutes long and not a huge commitment of time. It will cost one of the Ancient Town entrance tickets, which works out to be 24000 VND, good value!",
          "Now this is one of the sites in the old center worth spending one of the 5 tickets on. (A package of 5 tickets sold to you to enter 5 sites of your choice in Hoi An). Located near the water on the second floor, this is a small theater with a live performance. Lovely live music",
          "I found this to be a very good use of the old town tickets as mentioned by another reviewer. There is some air conditioning inside and I found the dancers graceful. A good introduction to Vietnamese Arts. We enjoyed the performance and found the experience pleasant and restful.",
          "I don't get people's reviews suggesting this is a tourist trap, of all the things in Hoi An to see I feel this is one of the most pleasant and definitely after the main few sites the best use of one of your 5 old town tickets. The shows lasts around half an hour and is an",
          "We used one of our 5 Old town tickets to see the dance and music show in the afternoon and it was really worth the visit! It was great to see some of the traditional dances and songs performed by a young group of people! Also the theatre was climatised and had very comfy",
          "It's a tourist trap. And a bad one at that. I was as bored as the musicians. The music was fine, but the show was embarrassing. Bad costumes and worse dances. Or the other way around... Go spend your time somewhere else. Or waste it here.",
          "Sure, some complain that this is a tourist trap but really! Where in the world isn't? At least it is cheap (VND 20k) and air conditioned - and I for one enjoyed the distraction. 3 shows daily 10.15am, 3.15pm and 4.15pm. Enjoy!",
          "The place holds workshop on mask making. Also on the first floor are organised regular theatre performance of traditional vietnamese dances. Very good.",
          "I didn\u2019t take any photo during the show. It was a small theatre and a small stage but the show was so beautiful. It took about half and hour for the whole show and ticket price was cheap. I\u2019d like to recommend ALL you guys visit this place. The music gonna make your day",
          "We visite this as a part of our five-places tourists ticket and went out laughing out loud. The music was played well but it was more like a circus for morons than a showcase of tradition. Many colorful lights, very ugly sparkling costumes and mainly the faces of \u201cartists\u201d",
          "Currently they have 3 shows lasting 1 hour each, per day 10.15 / 15.15 / 16.15 We went on the 10.15 show, at the entrance, they will give you 1 bingo card each person and 1 leaflet explaining the 5 short performances (photo below) They will take one of the 1 vouchers you have",
          "That was our spontaneous choice for the evening and it was the best we could go for in Hoi an. The show was lovely and I think it's great for everyone who wants to see something traditional and get to know the culture a bit more. Music and dancers did great job, I was smiling",
          "A mix of dancers and musicians performing in an intimate little old style theatre. The musicians are brilliant - they played some Vietnamese songs but also their own alternative rendition of Johann Strauss' \"The Blue Danube waltz\". The dance performances were equally",
          "We selected this show using one of our tickets purchased on entry to Hoi An town. It was absolutely amazing 3.15 p.m performance with amazing artists playing instruments, dancing and all with good humour. Beautiful costumes and excellent performances. Beautiful haunting music.",
          "Me and my wife had the pleasure of working and painting our own masks at this shop. They have only been open for 8 months on the day that we went there was no show as die to being low season they did not run the show however I highly recommend to give this place a go it is very",
          "The location of the show is 66 Bach bang street. It is next to the cultural information centre on the waterfront. The address previously posted is now a restaurant. We went to the correct location late to be told that they'd not sold enough tickets so their wasn't a show that",
          "A small group of dancers plus an authentic Vietnamese music group play a story through mime, music and song, with English translation. Excellent musicians, entertaining dancers and wonderful costumes make this an interesting show for all ages. We thoroughly enjoyed it."

The performers engaged the audience by inviting them to dance at the stage as well.

          "To dance in such a small space is so challenging. Then they made it appealing to the audience with portrayal of different styles of music too. Animated style reminded me of Broadway and its interaction with the observers. Lovely face masks and ofcourse the setting of the entire theatre on the water is awesome",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Marble Mountain Air Facility (MMAF), also known as Da Nang East Airfield and Marble Mountain Army Airfield, was an aviation facility used primarily by the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. It was a helicopter facility that was constructed in August 1965 and served as home to Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16), the 5th Special Forces Group and an assortment of other squadrons until May 1971. It was controlled by the United States Army from May 1971 to August 1972 and finally by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) from 29 August 1972 to 29 March 1975 when it fell to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). It was in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Da Nang Air Base on a strip of beach between China Beach and the Marble Mountains.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 28 July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that the U.S. would increase the number of its forces in South Vietnam from 75,000 to 125,000. The arrival of additional USMC and United States Air Force squadrons at Da Nang AB led to severe overcrowding at the base and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (I MAW) began looking for an alternative site for the helicopter squadrons of MAG-16. The Marines ultimately chose a stretch of sandy beach on the South China Sea that was about five miles southeast of Da Nang and just north of a series of red marble mountains for their first helicopter facility. American military construction units were overtasked at the time so the construction of the field was done by RMK-BRJ under the direction of the U.S. Navy Officer in Charge of Construction RVN. By the end of August 1965, they had completed a 2,000-foot (610 m) runway and on 26 August, MAG 16 officially moved in. A week later Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) would approve the name \"Marble Mountain Air Facility\" (MMAF).\n\nOn the evening of 27\u201328 October 1965, approximately 90 Viet Cong attacked MMAF. They attacked under the cover of 60 mm mortar fire using four demolition teams armed with Bangalore torpedoes and hand grenades. They were able to reach the MAG 16 ramp destroying 19 aircraft and damaging another 35. VMO-2 took the brunt of the attack with 13 of its UH-1E Hueys destroyed leaving the squadron with only four serviceable aircraft. The attack left two Marines and one Navy Corpsman killed in action with another 91 wounded. Seventeen Viet Cong were killed during the battle along with four wounded who were taken prisoner.MMAF saw the arrival of the first CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters in Vietnam when HMM-164 arrived on 8 March 1966 with twenty-seven aircraft from the USS Valley Forge.On 31 January 1968, on the first day of the Tet Offensive, MMAF received twenty-nine incoming enemy 122 mm rockets resulting in one minor injury and minor damage to one CH-53A Sea Stallion and substantial damage to another four CH-53As. Ten CH-46As and eight UH-34Ds also received limited damage. Four VMO-2 UH-1E armed helicopters were launched in defense of MMAF and engaged enemy units.Beginning in 1969 the United States began to reduce its forces in Vietnam and by mid-October all remaining Marine helicopter squadrons were consolidated at MMAF. On 1 June 1971 Marble Mountain Air Facility was turned over to the United States Army.In February 1971 the 11th Aviation Group was assigned to the 1st Aviation Brigade and redeployed to Marble Mountain. In August 1972 the group departed Marble Mountain Army Airfield and resettled at Da Nang AB.\n\n\n== Squadrons based at Marble Mountain ==\nThe following is an incomplete list of squadrons that were stationed at MMAF during the Vietnam War and the times that they were there:\n\nMarine Aircraft Group 16 (United States Marine Corps Aviation)16th Combat Aviation Brigade \u2013 December 1966 \u2013 1969\n282nd Assault Helicopter Company \u2013 1966\u20131970 \u2013 served at Marble Mountain until approx Dec 1971. Shortly later the company was disbanded.\n245th Surveillance Aircraft Company \u2013 1967\u2013197011th Aviation Group\n\n\n== Capture of MMAF ==\n\nBy 26 March 1975 Hu\u1ebf and all of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean, Qu\u1ea3ng Nam and Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Provinces had been captured by the PAVN and Da Nang was isolated. ARVN Lieutenant General Ng\u00f4 Quang Tr\u01b0\u1edfng organised his remaining forces, which numbered approximately 75,000 troops, into inner and outer defensive lines around the city, meanwhile the PAVN prepared to attack the city from four directions before its defenses could be properly established. Tr\u01b0\u1edfng's defensive plans were hampered by the presence of 1\u20131,500,000 refugees and ARVN stragglers who had crowded the city. Throughout 26 March evacuation flights by Air America, Air Vietnam, the RVNAF and World Airways from Da Nang AB took place but could not keep up with the vast tide of refugees. On 27 March the situation at Da Nang AB was becoming increasingly chaotic as panicked refugees surged to board a World Airways flight and began mobbing the other flights and gathering on the taxiways and runways. By the evening of 27 March all evacuation flights out of the base were stopped, but propeller aircraft continued to evacuate refugees from Marble Mountain Air Facility.The PAVN attack began on the morning of 28 March with an artillery barrage on the city, probing attacks quickly penetrated the ARVN defenses, and the fragile ARVN discipline collapsed and soldiers began to desert their positions and seek refuge for themselves and their families. On the night of 28 March General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng received intelligence that an all-out PAVN assault against the city would commence the next morning and he decided to abandon Da Nang and ordered his forces to move to beaches for evacuation by sea. The PAVN entered the outskirts of Da Nang by mid-morning on 29 March and by the afternoon were in control of the city.\n\n\n== Current use ==\n\nThe base remained largely intact until the early 2000s when commercial developments began to encroach upon it. A highway connecting Da Nang and H\u1ed9i An now runs through the former base and only a few concrete and steel \"Wonderarch\" aircraft shelters remain.\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 30 April 1969, a Seaboard World Airlines DC-8 airliner with 219 passengers and 13 crewmembers accidentally landed at Marble Mountain when it had been cleared to land at the nearby Da Nang AB. After fuel and passengers were offloaded the aircraft was towed onto the north overrun and departed without incident.\nOn 25 March 1970 two Marine AH-1s collided in mid-air 700 feet (210 m) above the base and crashed destroying both helicopters and killing all four crewmen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOverhead shots of MMAF area today\nPhotos of Marble Mountain area",

          "Good day trip to get up the mountain and get amazing panoramic views of the region. Also great for picking up souvenirs made from the marble/stones.",
          "hard climb up. inside the cave is not recommended for claustrophobic peoples. it is very beautiful if you climb the cave and see the view from the top. the attraction outside the cave is of course good enough.",
          "Visited as part of a tour. There are lots of steps to get to the top of the Marble Mountains - but it is worth it! There are great views across the area to be had from the top - as well as the pagoda and temples at the top.",
          "Good walk! the place seems popular with tour buses, but around lunch time everyone left so the feeling was very different then. we liked it!",
          "We were on a group tour of about 18 people. This was one of our stops when we were heading from Hoi An to Hue (all in the same day). I am very glad we got here early how it was just starting to get really warm. Its a long way up and some of the stairs are very tall. We all split",
          "Nice view and impressive sight. Well preserved, you should visit if you have a bit freetime in Da Nang",
          "Fantastic journey. This place was a very cool look at Vietnamese history. Lots of Budda and caves etc. I hope your fit.",
          "Went there with my family to enjoy the hill and you are immediately grabbed by people selling crafts. There is a charge to use the elevator both up and a separate charge to use it to come down. There is also an entrance charge and they won\u2019t even allow you to take a photo unless",
          "We came here for a few hours one afternoon and was not disappointed. The caves , pagodas and gardens were stunning and so peaceful. A fantastic view of the city from the river viewpoint. What I will say is that if you suffer from any mobility issues this may cause a few",
          "Brilliant if you don't feel like walking up the mountain there is a fast lift to the top for a small fee. Lovely pagodas. It seems a holy place for Buddhists . Quite tranquil. Don't buy anything from the local trades people up there it is very expensive. We were warned by the",
          "We jumped into this place out of schedule and didn't regret at all. View and surrounding was such an amazing. Truly a best place for an international tourist to visit.",

          "This place is beautiful and the cave with the big Buddha is just magical. I spent 2 hours in there just getting inspiration and enjoying the views. There are so many little corners to see. I would suggest to use the staircase to up and not the lift. It's such a better way to",
          "This place gave me goosebumps it was so beautiful. Inside the pagoda were monks chanting which echoed through the main area after the steep climb to the entrance. Make sure you wear suitable clothing as there are lots of steep stairs and caves to climb. Stunning views of the",
          "Wonderful place to visit. Very near to Da Nang and around 30 Kms from Hoi An. Some places are very slippery and difficult to climb. But worth climbing. A must place to see in Da Nang.",
          "These limestone mountains stand out near the beaches of Da Nang. We spent a couple of hours here climbing the step up to see different temples and go inside some of the caves. Good views from the top and some good exercise to work of the great food of the area",
          "Stunning caves here with opportunities to get absolutely beautiful pictures. You don't need to do a tour to get to this place. Either take an inexpensive taxi or the 6a bus for 5k. Cost to get in is 40k and another 20k for a separate cave by the entrance. Recommend doing both.",
          "We visited here with a tour guide who explained the temples and caves etc. Loved the hidden caves and temples inside these. It was very interesting and a definite must do. Our tour guide took us through tunnels and up to the top of the mountain where the view was amazing. If you",

          "This is \u201cMust see\u201d tourist attraction in DaNang. You have two choices there: Go up by elevator (2\u20ac) or by foot (1\u20ac). Climb to the top of the hill. View is amazing. Most of the caves are boring, because there are only Buddha statue and thats it!",
          "We visited Marble Mountains on the way to Hoi An. We paid a bit more to use the lift both ways but you can take the lift up and climb down if you had more time. There was a lot more to see than I had expected.",

          "A strange place atop a karst. Didnt actually see any marble. At the top of about 100 steps is about 5 pagodas and three small caves. Some annoyingly loud singing from some monks using microphones which they really didnt need. Cost an quite a lot too, 40 dong per adult, then 15",
          "We called in here en route from Hoi An to Hue and found it more interesting than anticipated. Primarily it's a series of caves, turned into places of worship, within one of the five marble mountains. The climb to the top gets increasingly steep and more difficult. In the end,",
          "Super cool and huge caves! Also lots of viewpoints. Inside the caves it is sometimes a little risky to climb the steep steps (wouldn\u2019t do it with kids) but the views from the top are worth it!",
          "We visited Marble Mountains as part of our journey from Hue to Hoi An. We didn't have high expectations but this place amazed us! It cost 35,000vnd each to enter the Marble Mountains and 15,000vnd each for the use of the lift each way. We chose to get the lift both ways but you",
          "Great place to visit, amazing carvings, caves, pagodas, garments and vistas. The way up and down is steep if you walk like we did, but there is an elevator and expect a lot of walking and climbing about at the top. It is not a small place and to do it justice you need several",
          "It is quite amazing to see these huge budha carvings deep inside mountain caves. Wonder how they were made so many years back. The exquisite works done inside mountain caves, carving from the rocks is fascinating.",
          "This place has many steps, but you can pay to take a lift up to the top and walk down from there. There are numerous caves to explore and many temples to visit. There is also a peak where you can get great views of the surrounding area, but that involves some more steps.",
          "Nice little venture, make sure you pack comfy shoes, and although it is seems hard make sure you go to the highest point!",
          "Was a bit of a last minute adventure, but absolutely worth it! Great views and interesting history that can be explored with any time frame. Just be prepared for some stairs! (there is an optional lift at one of the entrances)",
          "My wife and I booked a private tour of Marble Mountain through our hotel, the La Siesta, in Hoi An. Our guide, pronounced Home, was excellent. Our tour started with a brief stop at one of the family marble carvers. They had an amazing collection of statues and other art",
          "We were only able to see the first cave as very uneven steps and lots of them to go higher up.We asked and were told it was easy but definitely wasn\u2019t .A lift takes one part way up for an extra charge although not expensive.Notfor the elderly.",

          "Awesome temples carved inside the mountain. You have to see the amazing caves. View from the mountain is also fantastic. It would be difficult for people with some leg or knee problems, as one has to climb, and the surface is sometimes difficult to walk.",
          "Nice stop on the way to Hoi An. Visit to Marble mountain shouldn\u2019t take more than 45 minutes. Out of five natural mountains, one is open for visitors. During the visit you need to be prepared to climb some strange steps (very high steps), but effort is worth energy spent. View",

          "Good visit for a morning. We didn't bother with an organised tour, it wasn't needed. All you have to do is get a taxi which only cost 100,000vnd (4$) and head up there yourself. Once there you can buy a ticket to enter the mountain and if you wish buy a ticket that includes",
          "We went there to see the temple but inside there are more to see! Some good views with really cool cave plus the weather isn't too hot. Love it \ud83d\udc9e",
          "We had a private guide and had an hour or so here. We took the lift up the top and was explained much of the history rather than just wander around by ourselves. This meant we enjoyed it all the more. Very hot & crowded though, but well worth it. Just take your time.",
          "I booked this tour with a guide however it's definitely something that you can do on your own. The guide of the group tour was kind and friendly. Like other reviews have stated be ready to climb lots and lots of steps so if you have problems walking or have poor balance this",
          "Marble mountain is worth a visit if you have time in Da Nang. It has a lot of history behind it and has beautiful caves and view at the top. Visit when it\u2019s a bit cooler.",
          "Ideal for keen hikers, families with energetic children, rock climbers, also you can stick to footpaths and not have so much of an adventure. Do not wear flip flops within the caves, you need good grip. Well worth seeing, great value for money entrance fee and cheap snacks and",
          "This must be the far away No. 1 attraction for tourists visiting Danang. You must not miss it. The mountain is not high so taking the steps will be the wise choice even lift is available for a fee. Compared to other attraction entry fee in this city, climbing Marble Mountains",

          "I really enjoyed this place, was much better than expected. You have the option to go up by lift or u can climb up. But be prepared, after the lift you will climb many more stairs. There are maps around the place (we only missed the 'you are here' marks - so took a bit for the",
          "Worth a visit. Impressive caves and carved Buddhas. Wonderful views. Climbing through one of the caves to a view point was a good experience. We didn\u2019t take the loft as the walk up wasn\u2019t bad at all. It wasn\u2019t too busy when we went in the afternoon either.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit! We walked up the steep steps to the top and spent the day soaking in the beautiful view and breathtaking caves. Definitely somewhere I would recommend to any traveler!",
          "Easy to find if your driving yourself. Plenty of parking. There are tickets to enter by the stairs (40,000VND for 2 pax) & there are also tickets to enter by the elevator (not sure of the pricing of that.) There are quite a few stairs if you choose that ticket & be aware there",
          "I had no expectations, but really liked my trip to Marble Mountain. Some steps are really steep, but the view points are rewarding. The caves where nice too. Lack of direction signs.",
          "If you have a lack of time, recommend you skip this place. The scenary is unspectacular To get to the viewpoint, one has to climb over huge bolders . Not recommended for elderly or young children",
          "It is an easy way to go there as it is very close to Hyatt Resort, about 5 mins by taxi. The best way is to buy the ticket for entrance and one way to take the lift up as it is good to walk down the mountain. It takes about one hour to finish the tour.",

          "Beautiful set of mountains one of which has many Temples and Pagodas on top. You can walk up or take the elevator. Their are caves also which you can go into which have Buddha statues and other deities. Beautiful gardens and great views of the town. Some great picture",
          "We took 3 hours to visit everywhere..soon are quite steep walk ways but find the alternative one ..in summary the views are amazing",
          "I just wish that they would clean up the area around it. Get there early if you can. Be ready to climb some uneven steps.",
          "Great place to visit when in Da Nang - you can spend the entire day seeing the golden bridge and other attractions around it. It is located inside a themed park which seems like a mini Disney Land.",
          "I have been wondering what to write about this place for quite some time. Finally, I would go with many of the TA reviews which says it is a waste of time. I agree with that. It has the potential to be a great place, but actually when you go and experience it, there is nothing",
          "This is an amazing area to explore. From the outside it\u2019s hard to imagine all the intricate caves and sights inside. If you are fit and enable there are many caves and areas to explore here. No need to go up and down the lift. It costs about 50,000 VND by grab from Da Nang (10",
          "Great place to visit while you are in Da Nang. there is many temples and sculptures inside of the mountain. Inside of the cave gets humid and cold at the same time. Dont forget to bring water. Many crystal shops are all over around the mountain. You can get those in very good",
          "Although the view is not as spectacular as you would think, we enjoyed the afternoon on this hill. I don\u2019t see it as a mountain as it is not that high. We took a grab taxi from Da Nang Han Market that took us to here in approx. 20 minutes for 135K VND. You can enter the",
          "interesting to go some is overly jazzed up touristic style but within the caves some of the temples are indeed really old...few 00 years if intd buddhism culture go, scenic itself only so so",
          "The marble mountain is worth a visit. If you are afraid of heights you might not enjoy it so much. You can ride a glass lift so you don't have to walk up the steps but when you get out there are plenty more of them! There are maps to show you the different temples. The steps are",
          "only go if you are probably more keen on Buddhism. Otherwise, it is only an okay visit. I dont really enjoy it",
          "Some of the steps can been quite steep, if you have mobility issues this might not be the best option for you. But the views are breathtaking and the Sons (temples/pagodas) are worth every step. There is a toilet with no soap but did have paper, and there are drinks for purchase",
          "Really neat spot. Highly recommend Good views with caves and temples. Great way to spend afternoon after beach",
          "The 5 craggy tops are a major tourist attraction and therefore very busy, even though we visited late in the day. That said we really enjoyed the visit. There is an elevator to take you part way up the crag or a couple of paths. Inside the mountain are a series of natural caves",
          "Great place nice hike, too many buddha statue, caves, few steps :) input fee 40vng too many shops in near street with buddha statue,",
          "We were at the mountain just before 7.00a.m. to commence the climb. Many stairs so wear sensible footwear. We used only the stairs as the lift didn't operate until 8.00am. Great views from the top. I recommend to do this early before any crowds arrive so you get to experience",
          "I underestimated how impressed I was. Ancient temples sat in marble caves. Wasn't crazily crowded. Recommended if you like historic/religious sites. Yes, as other reviewers said, steep steps. Bottom line, it's an easy to access location. Not hours out of the city. So for",
          "Perhaps we didnt do our research - we thought we'd skip the stairs and get the elevator pass, but in truth there's still a fair amount of climbing to see all the sights and the great views from the top of the hills. wear proper shoes - the stones can be slippery in the rainy",
          "A lot of things for you to see and learn but need a guide to explain to be better understanding. A lot statues about Buddhism and others. Very near from center of Danang city so you can visit very quick within day.",
          "We were lucky to capture the sunset views of the other four marble mountains near the elevator. There are two caves here. The one at the top is pretty dangerous to climb especially on rainy days. We do not recommend this attraction for tourists will walking difficulties.",
          "Marble mountain is mid way between Danang & Hoi An. So we booked a cab from our hotel in Hoi An to Danang city with a stop over at the Marble Mountains. You can opt to walk up the steps which can be really tiring or pay 15k VND & take the elevator (one way). The moment you get",
          "The mountain opens at 7, which is the perfect time to get there so you can enjoy the peace and quite. Not wheelchair friendly. It\u2019s quite a marvel how this would have been carved out. Spent a blissful morning.",
          "You can take an elevator to the top and back down but there is still a lot of walking to see all the different caves. There are reasonable bathrooms available. The caves are very interesting and have status and temples within them.",
          "interesting visit, we took the lift to the top, but there are still plenty of steps to negotiate to get around, other than that a good day",
          "I found this place to be other worldly at times.The beams of light coming through the top of the caves the shrines etc and the people were so friendly. It was extremely hot so a hat and water are very very important. Definitely worth a half day or full day trip having a drink in",
          "Marble mountain is a day trip amazing views. Explore the culture and religion of danang. History bought forward to future....",
          "Worth the climb, views are great. Temples beautiful, lotus flowers in ponds and great photo opportunity. Lots of steps wear good no slip shoes, remember your water bottle, reasonable fitness highly recommended.",
          "While there are several mountains, I only went to one. I paid extra to take the elevator up (and paid again to come back down). Once off the elevator, one has to do lots more climbing of steps and bare rock. It is slippery climbing into caves. One can hike to the top and get",
          "We hired a grab and taxi to take us all over here he area for two days. You have to pay to enter the mountain to explore the caves. There is an option to pay to ride a lift to the top. I am recommend that you buy the lift ticket as the stairs in the cave are doable, yet",
          "It was a great little hike up the stairs. A few spots in the caves were tricky getting down but If you wear proper shoes and take your time you will be fine",
          "You need to pay 2 times to visit some of the caves, and other caves they got on the map and in the pictures, is not there at all. Then you need to pay for another cave so you need to pay 3 times. It is like average but not worth it.",
          "Fabulous and highly recommended. It\u2019s a must do as it\u2019s totally amazing and a photographers dream. Make sure you are accustomed to climbing stairs; thousands of them",
          "The location is quite strategic and the place is very well maintained. There's not really much to do but the view is beautiful. Has tons of spot to take photographs at. Too bad i didn't get the chance to explore the main attraction- the cave. It was raining when i went there at",
          "We set off by moped from Hoi An expecting to see beautiful unspoiled mountains. Instead we got hassled as soon as we arrived by a shop owner saying you park your bike for free here and then saying you buy from my shop for my family! There are loads of tourists, pagodas all over",
          "Went to the Marble Mountain as there are no other beautiful recommendation to go to. The place was not crowded when we visited. There\u2019s not much to see that interest me. It requires a little bit of hiking though. We chose to the elevator going up and down for a fee. Overall,",
          "We stopped at Marble Mountains and ended up at a marble factory. The mountains are easily visible from the road as is the pagoda. You need about an hour to walk up and down. There are very steep steps so walker beware. Wear good shoes as some parts are a little difficult to",
          "Part of a night tour to Da Nang. First stop Marble Mountains. Approx 500 or more steep and high steps up to wander from cave to cave interspersed with a Buddhist pagoda or statues here and there. The traditional \"marble carving village\" was a half carved statue with tourist",
          "Was hassled so much by the locals it was unpleasant. Coupled with the fact the people in front of the ticket queue warned us the ticket office tried ripping them off, we turned around and decided not to view.",
          "We came here on a short trip from Da Nang. We have used a lift to get up, we were surprised how many objects were on top. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "lots of climbing of stairs. i like the pagoda. didn\u2019t go in deep into the caves as some were very steep or dark. think can skip the hell cave near the entrance or ticket office which require ticket",
          "Allow about an hour to walk up and down. You need your runners on as some parts are a little difficult even if you take the lift. There are caves you walk through and one you have to climb out of. The view from the top is really nice.",
          "This was just nice place to see though not very unique. Very nice pagodas (sine in nit a cery good stare), adventerous rock climving in the caves.",
          "Do this if you have spare time otherwise I would skip it. The stairs are really steep which would have been worth it if the view at the top was spectacular which I didn\u2019t think it was. The caves are ok. We booked a taxi through a travel agent in Hoi An town to take us to marble",
          "Can explore the place if you have a day to spare. The direction on the sign board is not very clear but you still can locate yourself finally.",
          "It is a mountain even the young and old can visit as they have a lift available. Just pay for the usage and the entrance fees to the mountain . There are steep steps where one can miss to go into the cave. I waited outside the cave with 2 year old . It can be slippery so have to",
          "This we highly recommend to visit. But be ready for a workout when you visit. There is not to far to walk to all the different caves and temples but its stairs you have to pass everywhere. I dont recommend to go with to small children or older people. It is not easy walking this",
          "The Marble Mountains were a nice diversion on our drive from Hue to Hoi An. There are the typical assortment of tourist shops at the base. It is then either a relatively strenuous walk (in what is usually very humid weather) or quick elevator ride up to the top. At the top",
          "A fascinating marble mountain which has established a rewarding livelihood to various small traders who sell souvenirs , marble statues and small restaurants all around it. The mountain top can be reached by a lift and then walk around to aee carioys caves, pagoda and scenic",
          "Not much to view or cherish. I wouldn't recommend if u have to visit with kids. Not much to see around and very rude staff",
          "The mountains are beautiful and a must see staying in this area. Elevator ride up and many many steps down. The thing that really annoyed me is at the moment you get out of the taxi you get aproched by people who want to sell their stuff.",
          "The view from the top was breathtaking. Quite a unique caves. Spent 3 hours here since i am a slow climber. There is a special lift going up but we need to take staircase to go down.",
          "Unique temples and caves on the top of the mountain!! The biggest cave seemed like a scene from the Indiana Jones movie.",
          "The Marble Mountains have a lot to see. Many pagodas, pudha statues and views. Strong recommend aion!",
          "Second time of going around Marble Mountain and enjoyed it again. There are so many little places to explore and visit. The only thing I was disappointed in was the building of a huge hotel in front of it.",
          "If you have been to the caves in Guilin, this isn\u2019t spectacular. There is an elevator that will bring you to the top. You have to pay 15000 dong in addition to the admission ticket. Expect some steep climb. It\u2019s manageable though. If you have time to spare, you can consider this",
          "The cluster of the 5 limestone hills is worth a visit. It's located 9 kilometer south of Da Nang. Use the elevator and then the stars to climb the top. Bring your camera with you!",
          "The uneven steps could be a problem for some, especially if wet. The caves were not as interesting as I was anticipating. This could possibly be due to our tour guide who had little history or information to share with us.",
          "It was worth the trip from Da Nang or Hoi An and is best done with the caves or the nearby Monkey Mountain.",
          "First experience taking a lift to the top of the mountain. But thats not all, you have to clime to reach the Peak of the mountain. Nice scenery once the lift door open. One side you can see the Sea with strong wave, the other side you can the other 4 mountains. A great history",
          "Take the elevator up & down (instead of taking the high & uneven steps down as it can be quite dangerous). There is a big statue of Buddha & temple. The caves are slippery, dark, cooling & to our group, a bit eerie going into the caves. After getting into the main cave, we",
          "Very nice mountain with mysterious cave. We learn some history hundred years from tour guide.Nearby mountain you will see the carving stone village and you buy some small statues for souvenirs gift.",
          "It is close to our hotel. The road to the venue is not loaded with traffic. The place is cool when you reach the higher parts of the mountain. You can also offer prayers and incense to the temples for blessings. The nearby vendors are friendly as well.",
          "Go in here only if you have time and nothing else to do.Otherwise just passing by this place is good enough.",
          "Well, is nice but I believe is overrated. I don\u2019t believe is a must and no one should feel that missed anything if not here. Large, LARGE groups of Asian(Chinese) tourist that are getting them here with big busses and it gets very,very crowded without particularly no reason. The",
          "At the Marble mountains you can visit several pagodas and small and larger caves that contain Buddha statues and worship places. It\u2019s nice to look at, especially the largest of the caves with the gigantic Buddha statue, but not so special and full of tourists. Walking around the",
          "Avoid this place. It is overpriced even by the standards of other shops selling marble in the same street. Unfortunately I discovered this afterwards when I went back the next day and compared prices more thoroughly. If you have the misfortune of being cornered by a sales",

          "Being a hide-out for fighters from the North-Vietnamese army a few decades ago it is now a well-know tourist destination worth to visit even you have to mange a lot of steps. A visit to Da Nang is not completed without visiting the Marble Mountains.",
          "Great trip today with a thoughtful and informative tour guide, great driver too! VINS our guide really gave us lots of information and time to look around, great price too. Lots of steps but slippery in the wet so take care, but worth the visit.",
          "The Marble Mountain is really worth spending a few hours on. There are lots of stairs and they are very uneven in most areas, so you will have to wear proper shoes. Once you up in the center of the Marble Mountain, you can find shops, restaurants and restrooms, so you will only",

          "5 Mountains, but only one you can actually go inside.Heard about it.Had to check it out. You can take the Lift or walk up the Stairs. You walk into a Cave, & then into other Caves. Some are lit quite well, where others a little Dim.In one Cave, there is a lot of Steps leading",
          "Do it only if you have time to kill. The sculptured look like they are made of cement rather than marble. Also, they don't sell elevator tickets for up and down together. To go up you queue downstairs to buy tickets and then to use the elevator, same thing when you want to go",
          "If you are staying in Da Nang, it's definitely worth taking some time to walk through some of the caves. It was interesting but not the highpoint of our trip. I'd spend a few hours to see it and then venture elsewhere. Check the local shops for sculptures but be sure to",
          "Be aware of a few nutters around the first temples and beyond as they try to be your tour guide and then ask for money. You must buy a ticket to the Am Phou caves for 15,000 Dong and for a ticket to the marble Mountain. I highly advise you do both. The lift costs 30,000 dong for",
          "I didn\u2019t know what the expect before coming here but we absolutely loved it. Lots of tourists & a bit hard to move around & enjoy any peacefulness in such a wonderful place, but so worth a visit just for the amazing scenery & ancient places of worship.",
          "The marble mountain is very common for me. I don't think there are much things to see within Marble Mountain. Perhaps you can take some good pictures. By this time we reach there, it was getting dark and starting raining.",
          "I visited as a solo traveller on 02/12/19. You can pay 15,000D each way for the lift, or take the stairs which I chose to do. Some interesting climbs up rocky slopes, a climb through a cave and stunning views at the top. Definitely a must see if you\u2019re passing by!",

          "I went to BaNa hills the day before this and spent a lot of time walking around there. I loved marble mountain but disliked BaNa hills. Save your energy and visit marble mountain. There are soo many spots to take great photos. Worth the journey. No need to purchase the elevator,",

          "It is quite a workout to get up there. Even with the elevator, you still need to hike up a lot of staircases. But, it would be well worth the visit. The cave is magnificent. And the view from the highest peak was breathtaking. It is pretty accessible too, by bus, motorbike or",

          "Marble Mountain is a unique place for sure. I've never visited anything quite like it before. The site was smaller than I expected but there is still a lot of walking and climbing up and down stairs. You will sweat on your visit, and I don't recommend it for people with limited",

          "A must go when you are in Da Nang! Only 20min drive from Danang city Center. We climbed up 300 big steps to the top then visited 3 caves and some temples! Took the lift down , stunning view next to the lift! We enjoyed Marple Mountain so much even it was rainning!!!",
          "The Marble Mountains are accessible by taking public transport which was nice. Once we got off our bus, ladies from souvernir shops followed us to ask to buy something. This is something we didn't like but which is common in tourist attractions and thus you have to accept this.",

          "Very nice place to visit inside and outside, plan to stay at least 3h if you want to go thru all the paths, it\u2019s huge. Some of the stairs especially inside the cave are very sharp, need to be in good shape. No need to take the elevator back, the stairs are ok and not so long.",
          "A welcome relief from the incessant heat at this time of year, with a fantastic view of the other nearby mountains. Would have been a great view of the bay as well but there's a resort currently under construction blocking the majority of the view on that side. Be warned that",
          "Very nice place to visit, all on a sugar-hill with many temples and caves. Paths in some caves can be quite busy during some holidays. Plan at least 2-3hours if you want to see all. The view on top is amazing but climbing path is a bit difficult, my 5yr-old managed to do it with",
          "We loved this place. The entrance fee was only 40K VND, so really really cheap. I recommend to walk on your own to the top, unless you have some health conditions. Otherwise you can pay for an elevator. And the nature and caves were stunning.",

          "Catch the lift up and walk back down. You need your energy at the top to walk around the many stairs and caves. There are sellers of cold drinks within the mountain complex. You will get waved in if riding a bike or driving a car to say you can park outside their shop for free",

          "Must see attraction. 60,000 dong to use the elevator, great for those that need assistance in walking but if you can, its worth walking the stairs to extra sights you will have the opportunity to see. Walking will be 40, 000 dong . Explore many of the temples, caves and",

          "There are not much to see on Marble Mountains. However, if you like trekking on rocky (marble) trails and see caves, you can definitely go. Another interesting reason to go to this place is that, due to availability pf marble in abundance, you will find so many huge sculptures,",

          "It\u2019s hot, sweaty but worth the effort! Ok so we didn\u2019t see every single cave but we saw a lot and it really is worth doing. Suggest you take the elevator up as there is still quite a few steps and gentle climbing to get up the rest of the way if you want to see it. There are",

          "This was part of a private tour I took. My guide was very helpful in explaining everything and showing me things I might have missed, so I\u2019d recommend going with a guide. We got a 360 degree view of Danang from the top, which was worth the climb. I enjoyed the caves. I\u2019d",
          "Went there last month, weather is hot, but in the cave itself is cool. You got to spend time to explore it. Many Buddha in the cave and you will find stalactite inside the cave.",
          "We had a quick visit in marbled mountains en route to Hoi An. Hmmm nothing special. Full of tourists with a few who can understand and speak basic english. Yes, it\u2019s worth a visit. But do not expect much.",
          "Thank goodness there is a lift to get you up top, I did not know what to expect but the wonders and beauty of this mountain and the heritage and marble carvings throughout the mountain top and caverns and caves were mindblowing - a must to see - We did this as a private tour",
          "This was truly a great experience. We had a private tour guide and although there is many steps it\u2019s so worth the time spent there.",
          "We had planned a full day trip to ba na mountain and when we were finished in 3 hours we decided to stop on the way back to Hoi An! Don\u2019t wear anything but sensible shoes, trainers or similar! Lots of steps and very steep rocks to climb inside some of the caves. Once your at",
          "Nice views,caves are interesting be prepared for steps decent shoes recommend ,lots of photo opportunities",
          "We went to the the marble mountains on a cloudy day as our hotel was about 10min walk. The views are great from the top of the mountains but the caves weren\u2019t anything spectacular",
          "We visited here and didn't know what to expect. This place is very unique and full of fascinating history. There are many carved stone buddhas in the caves - each one very different. To get to the main cave you need to climb a number of stairs to get there. Well worth it",
          "Lovely place with a few caves and mountains for you to explore. Be prepared to sweat alot thou as there's lotsa staircase climbing and walking. Out of the five mountains, we only managed to explore thuy son mountain and we a soaked with our own sweat. Do wear something",
          "Recommend making a day of visiting the Marble Mountains and then continue to Hoi An, to enjoy the beautiful beaches and fresh seafood for lunch. Wake up early and head to the Marble Mountains when there are few visitors and the air is still cool.",
          "This was located about one kilometer away from our hotel (Centara Sandy Beach Resort). Best time to visit in hot summer is in the morning. There is an elevator which you can see from the main road. This elevator can make it easier to view.",
          "We visited Marble mountain while using private taxi for transfer from Hue to Hoi An. We purchased entry ticket including elevator. Price was VND 40,000/ for entry and VND 15,000/ for elevator (one way) per pax. Elevator is worth saving time and trouble. Cave and pagodas in",
          "This is an interesting attraction. Probably the best way to view it is to take the elevator up and work your way through it and down. There is more than one entrance - if you take the entrance to the left of the elevator be prepared to climb some stairs and you will view",
          "We passed it several times and didn't realize we almost missed this amazing place! Better put on tracking boots or sandals to move there safely. An amazing place to visit with pagodas, rocks and caves and a spectacular view.",
          "I flew over the Marble Mountains virtually every day in 1971 but was never able to tour them since the Vietnam Congress had control of the inside temple areas. This tour was impressive and gave us the chance to see something that was no doubt hundreds of years old. Well worth",
          "Took the elevator up. Enjoyed exploring and walking around but with a 2 year old, it can get tiring after a while. One important tip: make sure to bring your own or buy water before heading up. You can get water but it's REALLY expensive!",
          "So I decided to pass by quickly to see the Marble Mountains and I was shocked to see the amount of tourists coming there as well. Be prepared to sweat as the steps are very steep, wear comfortable clothes and shoes and bring a portable fan if you have. Once you reach the top",
          "My husband and I had a good visit here duration was about 2 hours wondering around different locations on the guide map shrines,caves,different view points . You buy tickets and can catch an elevator to the top entrance area I recommend there is many stairs walking around",
          "This was a good time filler. It was super steep in some areas, humid days keep you sweating a storm. Lots of temples, shrines, caves, etc on the main level. If you're lazy or not able, you an take an elevator to the main level. The piece that goes up to the peak is very steep,",
          "On a hot day forget the climb n take the elevators up n down. Views are good up the peak and literally no sweat so it is best to spend the money on the elevators n really enjoy the trip rather than reach the top tired n exhausted in the hot summer. To add to it do have a",
          "Went there on a steamy afternoon. Not the best time! We hike all the mountain tops and once of them requires a lot of efforts! but the view is really nice from up there.",
          "We saw much better caves in SaPa and the step weren\u2019t so slippery. Pay careful attention when buying entry tickets because they automatically add the price of a small souvenir handbook you really won\u2019t want. Loaded with bus tours.",
          "Must must visit !! It\u2019s gets bit tiring in the end. Best time to go - very early in the morning or late evening.",
          "make sure you have good walking shoes. there were more steps than I thought but it is worth the visit. Especially when you lear the history. We took the lift up and walked down. this is where you need good walking shoes as the steps are well used with marble exposure and can be",
          "If you can walk up stairs, take the stairs and enjoy it. We only had just over an hour which wasn\u2019t enough time to see and enjoy the place. Amazing the marble carvings are all done on the actual mountain and nice caves. Nice view from the top except for the massive building",
          "Not a lot of steps or climbing at all, great view as well, Didn't see any monkey though, but they don't get out a lot as the monkey's are to aggressive",
          "You can not and must not miss out on this amazing spot. We were lucky as we went with one trip who had lots of information on the history. I strongly suggest that using these motor bike guys is a great way to visit. By taking the stairs you get way more photo opportunities and",
          "This cave is amazeballs. A must see if visiting Da Nang. Lots to look at inside this mountain that holds a lot of history. There are lots of stairs so make sure you have comfy shoes on.",
          "What a fabulous mountain. You can walk up steps or take an elevator (but take the steps if you can) to begin exploring the caves, caverns, niches, and fantastic views. Not for the faint of heart becasue some of the climbs walks/ can be tough. But well worth the effort!",
          "A quick elevator ride is the easy way to start the journey. It drops you off at a garden level where there a few grottos and statues. You wind your way to caverns and monastic buildings ensconced in the folds of the mountain. An occasional monk pops out. They have their in",
          "My wife and myself visited this particular place while on a tour of the city.. Firstly, anyone who is in anyway disable will only access a very very small part of this attraction.. A lift will take you up to a level where you will see pagoda , a statue and view some of the",
          "Was very interesting and having a guide who knew the history was essential to get the most from what was in offer as it is about the ethnic culture behind the sites",
          "You can skip this if you are from SEA or Taiwan/China where Buddhist temples are common. Overall it just a sort of monastery with many caves , pagodas and tourist !!! . Take the steps up instead of the elevator if you are reasonably fit. It\u2019s not too steep",
          "Visited here by motorbike. Paid for the lift (no queue) this isn't for the faint hearted. There are lots of steps! Great views. Take plenty of water.",
          "Located about 20 minutes from central Danang, the Marble Mountains are a must see. I think it\u2019s 30K VND for entrance and you can pay 15K to take the elevator up to save some time and your legs. There\u2019s about 6 pagodas about 5 caves. In the caves, you\u2019ll find large Buddhas and",
          "Nice site to see better to go by bike or Grab Almost 1hour to see everything Not so much to do in Da Nang",
          "Marble Mountain was part of our transfer from Hue to Hoi An. I would totally recommend to skip this place and spend more time on Hai Van Pass or even L\u0103ng Co beach. There are two entrances 1) to some cave 2) An elevator to the top. For each entrance there is a charge. Not",
          "It\u2019s basically a Buddhist temple area in a small mountain. There is a lift to go up or you can otherwise choose to go by stairs. Lift will cost approx 15 K VND. Temple is quite beautiful definitely, especially the view from the very top and the cave temple.",
          "Very nice to see . Beautiful gardens. Great view of Da Nang. Beautiful Temple. We were very lucky & had a guide to ourselves who was knowledgeable.",
          "Awesome place. Allow 3-4 hours to do the whole thing at a leisurely pace. Lots of walking on natural stone steps, to caves and pagodas and lookouts. Make sure you see the large cave at ground level near the entrance as well. Really worth a visit",
          "Good to see, nice to have a tour guide which we booked through our hostel. Worth it for only $270,000. Wished there was less people for photo ops though. We went early morning and was still too busy so I recommend doing it in the am",
          "It's the local's public holiday and the whole area is flooded with crowd. We spent 1.5 hours climbing here and there to visit all caves and temples. Note that there are single pathway for up and down, thus you need to be patient. Also, lot of locals love photo taking, please be",
          "We visited Marble mountain whilst staying in Denang. We got picked up at 8am it was about 10 minutes drive from our hotel, I would recommend you go early as we were there about 2 hours and it gets very hot going up and down the steps also it wasn\u2019t too crowded, as we were",
          "The Marble \"Mountains\" are more like hills near Danang that can be reached by an elevator or 10 min of stair climbing. There is a cool pagado and some very interesting Buddhist temples in caves within the mountain. The viewpoints were disappointing through, other than the",
          "At First Sight you would think they are not very big mountains, but it's what's inside that is interesting. There you will find a pagoda cop out from inside the mountain made of marble. By just standing inside there you can feel it,the atmosphere. It has a certain kind of",
          "The Mountains is the highest point in the Da Nang city and it gives a good view of the city overseeing the ocean. Nice cave to climb.",
          "This is another interesting place to visit when in Da Nang. You get spectacular views of Da Nang from here however the highlight for me was visiting the caves with the Buddha\u2019s in them. The elevator is certainly worth the fee!",
          "The Marble Mountains is not fat from Da Nang. They are temples set in natural caves in the karst pinnacles. You can get a lift to take you up to them and or climb the steps. The temples and prayer caves are interesting to see. Many SE Asians have made their prayer places in",
          "We went here on a public holiday so it was very busy. We decided on a private car with a guide which was a great choice and not much more than a general tour. Tin was very knowledgeable and being able to look at leisure was great. The caves were full of old artefacts and",
          "Definitely pay the inexpensive fare to take the lift; avoid the overlooks because new high rise hotel construction is blocking the view. I don\u2019t think this was a necessary stop on our drive to Hue from Hoi An.",
          "We went as part of a half day tour which included visiting marble factories and a museum which is not necessary, the Marble mountain though is a great place to visit. There as a lot of crowds however go early in the day, grab a map and do your own tour in your own time as tour",
          "We got a Grab taxi from our hotel to the mountains in the morning, arriving about 9ish hoping to avoid the hottest part of the day. There are separate ticket booths depending on whether you want to go up the elevator or walk up the stairs. Also a large number of shops at the",
          "What a fascinating \u201cgem\u201d of a hike!!! The journey upward is wow every step of the way. The most peaceful gigantic Buddha ever, fun tunnels and secret caves all leading to the most epic sanctuary where the wounded from the wars used to go to hide and get medical treatment, hidden",
          "It was a pleasant ride out from HoiAnn....... about 35 mins on a scooter. However, there seemed to be a problem with bike parking..... nowhere in the bus/car parks. So the locals were touting for business...\u2019no charge, no charge\u2019 with stories of bikes being stolen. Who",
          "Prepare your good pair of shoes to walk around the mountain and to explore caves! There are steep steps to actually hike up in the cave which i did not manage to do it - i was on sandals :( I took the elevator up and came down by stairs - the stairs was short and was nicely",
          "Da Nang, itself is a beautiful place. These Mountains if you happen to miss them then it isn't something that you would regret. But if you still invest your time then words of caution - be aware of scammers. We got cheated once then we got alerted on our way. This helped us to",
          "Packed with tourists. Our backpack got cut open on the bottom, luckily it\u2019s made with two layers of thick material so we didn\u2019t lose anything. If you look into other reviews you will see it happens all the time. My suggestion: Don\u2019t even waste your time to come here.",
          "It's an amazing place! All the temples on the top! We spend about 1,5 hours here but we would have stayed longer if we didn't need to get our train... The cave with the stairway to enlightenment is a big plus! Just explore everything if you have the time!",
          "We were brought there by our guide, on our way to Bho Hoong village. We had no idea what it was. The visit to the cave is interesting and the view is nice from the pagoda at the top. However, the whole visit is aimed at making you spend money in the marble shops.",
          "I expected a spiritual experience of Vietnam but this place is lit up like a Christmas tree. More neon blue than enlightenment. Shame i imagine it once was cultural place to visit but has quickly become a very tourist attraction.",
          "We enjoyed the Marble mountains and the cave with the Buddha etc. There is a lift to initially get you up the mountain which is around 15000VND, its worth doing it first as there is plenty of stairs to climb. If you are travelling through the area, is worth going through and",
          "We\u2019ve been there for about 2 hours and we liked it, cause there\u2019s a lot to see. But you have to be fit, cause there are a lot stairs and as known from Vietnam they aren\u2019t the same heights.",
          "We visited the Marble Mountains on a guided tour with our young sons. The mountains are impressive, offering wonderful scenic views. There are a range of caves - many with historical links to the war - and numerous pergodas and temples. All are easy to access. You\u2019ll find",
          "It is suitable for those who like to walk, it is for young people, its cave is very beautiful and magical",
          "We stopped off here on our transfer from Hoi An to Hue and went early in the morning. If you\u2019re able to then that seems the right time to go as it isn\u2019t crowded and the temperature is bearable for climbing a lot of steps. There are a number of beautiful caves and unexpected",
          "We arrived by Grab Scooter - 20 mins one way from Hoi An and the drivers were there waiting for us after the agreed 1.5 hrs. Yes, the hawkers do descend but just be firm and friendly and they back off quickly. We caught the lift up and walked down as it was very hot. It was",
          "this was my favourite spot to go to. I wish I had had more time as it needs to be at least 4 to 5 hours to actually enjoy what it has to offer. Very hard sales pressure to buy when going to the base of the mountain.",
          "Amazing location and mountain to explore with lots of hidden surprises and stories As you start to explore you discover far more of the mountain but please take your walking shoes Well worth a visit and then explore the marble shops on the street after One of the best",
          "I joined this tour at the last minute and I'm glad I did. Lots of steps but nice temples to stop and visit every so often. The view from the top was great.",
          "This place is amazing, it has many places to visit, caves and pagodas. There are 2 viewpoints for astounding views around. 40k VND entry 15k VND for lift one way. I highly recommend visiting here.",
          "I thought this was highly overrated. You are bombarded with people selling marble goods in the marble village upon approach which immediately turned me off. You have to pay more money (only 10,000 vnd) to use the elevator which is a shame for people who cannot use stairs. I did",
          "It is not an awe-inspiring place but still it is a must do in Da Nang. Easy place to explore and better to have a guide take you there to explain the background. Can get some nice pictures there.",
          "On a recent trip to Hoi An the concierge at the Mgallery Hoi An suggested my daughter and I visit the Marble Mountain park. I was a little reluctant, I am the reluctant tourist, buy my daughter was in, so I guess so was I. Our driver did his best to get us to spend some $ at",
          "Combine a religious component + nature + exotic ingredient + workout session + learning = this place. Impossible to miss it while in Da Nang.",
          "This is a great attraction with lots to see on the mountain itself, as well as views of the ocean and surrounding areas. The caves with Buddhist shrines in particular are very peaceful and beautiful. However, it still is a mountain, so bring walking shoes and plenty of water.",
          "It is a hard climb. I would rather suggest you to take the elevator to the top and then from there walk upto as much as possible for you. Please do visit the mountain of water,the most famous one. Lot of statues of buddha, caves & pagodas. Dont forget to bargain at the shop",
          "We were not that impressed , so underwhelming after some of the places we had been to. Plus got sick of climbing up and down steps . Found out you have to pay again if you want to go back by the lift.",
          "We visited with a tour guide an a half-day tour from Hoi An. We went up the Water mountain via the elevator (AUD$2 per person). It is also possible to walk up the steps to get to the top near the elevator (15min). There are two ways to walk up the Water Mountain so we came back",
          "If you get a driver to take you there, note they will take you to a marble retailer first where you will pay more than the merchants at the mountain, and I suspect the driver gets a % of what you buy. The architecture and caves at the mountain are awesome, but there are a lot of",
          "You should allow up to four hours to explore all of Marble Mountains so its good to start early when it is not so hot and of course wear comfortable shoes, and if you can, bring a torch. Vietnamese children sell souvenirs at Marble Mountains and you can expect to be hassled",
          "If you go after 5 there is nobody working the admission booth, and all the guests are leaving but you can still walk around. I went into the big chamber cave and was alone in there. Kind of surreal and would have stayed longer to meditate except the inscense gave me a headache.",
          "Be ready to climb steps and sweat! Sneakers a must! Amazing. There is a lift for the second part so that should make it easier for older people and children and prams",
          "Took the lift up and did not expect to see much but we were pleasantly surprised. The caves and grottoes and the statue of the Lady Buddha were all fascinating.As were the views I would definitely recommend a trip here. But don't get fooled by the shops across the road, the",

          "The statues and caves were really pretty and there were more of these, both small and large, than we expected. We stayed close to 2 hours, but did not visit all the caves. We bought the separate ticket required to take the elevator up so we could skip the stairs, but was met",
          "Beautiful and peaceful place to visit. Great creatures of Buddha\u2019s in the mountains. Go in the morning before all the tourists are coming.",

          "The views and carvings are wonderful but so many stairs. The day we were there it was very humid and it made the effort of climbing all the stairs very unpleasant. The toilets are not the best and you should take your own tissues. A grumpy old lady was selling a few sheets of",
          "Really nice place to visit. Take the elevator at first and enjoy climbing, stairs, caves and scenery. Breathing taking in many ways",
          "The marble mountains are an large set of temples, statues and pagodas on and inside the mountains. Especially all the holy places they built inside the caves of the mountains are fascinating. In addition there is the history of the marble mountains during the vietnam war. So",
          "Had a great morning at Marble Mountain. It\u2019s the place that keeps on giving!! Full of scenic views, temples, rock climbing and places to rest and drink. People are great, we got an early start as gets hot. Marble can also be slippy - beware!! Well worth a trip though!",
          "came here unprepared got the ticket with lift up to marble mountain 55k didn't realise theres walking to do...but uneven steps i had flip flops on thinking i'd be fine scenery up here is beauiful and the budha and monks worshipping ... is so peaceful would recommend you bring",
          "It is impressive and beautiful. The ticket costs 40,000 vnd and you can spend 1-2hours. Depends on how much patience you have for taking nice pictures. There are some stairs or elevator which I think it costs extra. Many groups of tourists so it might be a good idea to avoid",
          "Although not completely undertsandable for us Europeans it is a beautiful place to visit but very commercial.",
          "Go in the morning... Less People, less mosqitos and the air temperature is cooker. If you go by taxi.. Stay away from the rock gifts shops",
          "Right this is an amazing sight and well worth a vist. But be prepared there's a lot of steps involved in this vist. Even if you take the lift. When you come out the lift there are still a lot of stairs.. These stairs are marble and are very slippery when there's even a small",

          "We visited a souvenir shop that sold \"hand carved marble\" souvenirs. One piece that we purchased had broken on our trip home. Tried to contact the seller via their website only to find website not available. Did a google search and found a trip advisor review from 2012 to check",
          "Marble Mountain is a very short trip away from Da Nang and a must see. You don\u2018t need to use the elevator. You only safe a walk of not more than 5 minutes.",
          "Have a look around this amazing marble mountain of statues, carvings and infrastructures. You also get to experience climbing the rocky terrain and take a 360-view of the sea and surroundings of marble mountain. If you are not claustrophobic, you could try to pass through the",
          "Marble mountain was a nice relaxing hike/attraction. Lots of steps but nothing too strenuous. There is a lift that you can pay extra for to take you part way up if you don't want to attempt the stauirs. Go early in the morning to beat the crowds and vendors. Interesting caves",
          "Great place to visit in Da Nang area, I absolutely recommend! The view from the top is worth climbing to the highest viewpoint.",
          "If you happen to be in Da Nang and wondering what to do, I'd definitely recommend The Marble Mountain. It's a great half day trip with some really rewarding view from the top. At parts going up can be a bit steep, but nothing too challenging. If you have a guide then can show",
          "For only 40.000 dong (1.5 euros) you get access to an incredible nice mountain temple. Recommend strongly",
          "Stopped here as part of our Tour. The climb is a bit steep and slippery in parts so make sure you wear appropriate footwear. I would also suggest visit in the morning as it can become quite hot, although you do get a little bit of shelter with the cave and surrounding trees.",
          "We rode a motorbike to the Mountains, didn't really know what to expect. The caves and temples are very interesting to see. The climb to the top is through a cave over worn rocks, a great experience but slightly hard work. The place is slightly let down by the large number of",
          "I say an evening visit since it was a very hot day when visiting and it was slightly cooler when we arrived. There appeared to be a one way system after ascending by lift, but one can walk up if you have the energy! You must have some flat and comfortable shoes. Coming down",
          "We visited Marble Mountain and although it was very warm the scenery was worth the short hike up the stairs, so many beautiful butterflies and the inside of the cave had a very special feeling of calmness, we will be back as kids were getting restless from the heat, we would",
          "Fantastic place with a lovely peaceful atmosphere, however I feel that you need to be steady on your feet as there are a lot of steps and they are old and steep in some places. There is an elevator up if you don't wish to walk up, there is a charge for this both up and down",
          "There are lots of local people who want you park motorcycle in their place just for 5.000 VND. But you can park everywhere for free. You can choose if you pay for a lift or go on the stairs. There are many caves and temples. It is a nice place for visit.",
          "Marble Mountain is a very beautiful place. Now around the mountain there's a lot of scams. there's people that'll be nice to you just up charge you. I had a woman that said that I could park in front of her shop is long as I bought something on my return. I kinda had a feeling",
          "The mountain itself is beautiful. However at the bottom you'll find shop owners running over to your scooter from all directions screamimg at you to park with them. Most asking 10.000- 15.000D ask around we found a fella across from the ticket box for 3.000D. Its not many stairs",
          "We were not told there was an elevator up to the top. My husband in his 70\u2019s found the walking up the mountain a bit hard as did I. Thankfully we found the elevator to go down.",
          "Not a must visit attractions. Entry cost 40K VND, additional 15K VND for taking elevator. inside the cave there are many stairs and statues. To climb up the top, the steps are very steep and narrow path. If your itinerary is tight, can give this a pass.",
          "This was amazing! There is so much to see and experience here with the beautiful carvings and the views. Caution - there are MANY stairs, and they can be steep, narrow & difficult to navigate at times. If you can make the climb, the views at the top are worth it!",
          "Our group of 6 visited Marble Mountain in the morning. It was a pleasant overcast day. Our guide told us there are many flights of stairs to climb so for those who don't have good knees they have the option of taking the elevator. Cost an additional VND15,000/pax/way. Entry fare",
          "Our last day in hoi an, after bidding farewell with our friends at Jade Hotel, we had gone for another tour on our own to marble mountains before our evening flight. Scenery was beautiful. Seeing the cave, once you go inside, you will need to climb into the more beautiful site.",
          "It\u2019s a great place to visit. A place where you have a 360 degree view of Da Nang city with views to the ocean, mountains and rivers. Strongly recommend a visit. Will come again with our children next time.",
          "Marble mountain is spiritual place with a lot of caves, Buddha statues and good views. Actually, this are 5 hills, which represent 5 elements: metal, water, wood, earth and fire. Of course, like on every touristic place the prices of souvenirs are too \"attractive\".",
          "We got recommended by the hotel manager to go to Marble Mountain so we decided to check it out as it was close by. We decided to take the elevator up which took 2 minutes! We paid 40,000 for entry fee and one way lift cost 15,000! Good place to past time and see different caves",
          "Beautiful views and place but take sturdy shoes there are a lot of steps. You\u2019ll defo get a work out. Suggestion go as early as you can, it\u2019s cooler and the coaches haven\u2019t arrived yet.",
          "Nice caves to see and photo taking however not recommended for elderly as there are a lot of high and steep steps. One of the caves require you to climb through a small hole which is really interesting!",
          "This is the perfect place to observe hundreds, maybe thousands of Chinese tourists in on small enclosed space. There is an amazing variety of them, and most of them move really slowly, so you have time to study them in great detail.",
          "There is two ways up to Heaven. The one through the cave is more difficult, but more rewarding. Be careful the marble stones are slippery as ice, but worth the effort.",
          "There was 40k entrance fee and after going up the stairs there were loads of tourists and it just didnt seem a calm and a serene place that we hoped for. Be aware: there was quite a lot of smoke in the cave - probably that the sunshine rays could be seen. Got some nice instagram",
          "This place is very nice, some small mountains here which is called Marble Mountains. It is very easy to lost the way or miss some beautiful caves. Hope to come here more and more to show the beauty of Vietnam to tourists.",
          "This place is located between Hoi An and Da Nang, it is such a beautiful place for visiting. Just not for kids and senior people, because some caves are quite dark, and slippery.",
          "The mixed reviews I guess is based on how long you stay. There are several major Sites and the best caves were deeper in where few visit. We found the walk up easy. The caves were really cool and the view from the top spectacular. Most tours spend 30 minutes. If possible,",
          "There is an entry fee of 40000 VND and optionally an additional 15000 VND for the elevator. Once on top you have to walk anyway to visit the various caves. One of the caves is a bit challenging in one point, but all in all the site is easily accessible as long as you can climb",
          "My son and I were on a six day visit to Vietnam. We spent a little while visited the local marble shops.We received a great tour of how pieces are made. These folks were very talented and do very detailed work. The young lady that gave us the tour advised us that no matter how",
          "It feels like you\u2019re on another planet when you there. Entrance is only 20,000. Inside the cave is cooler.small little town has magical feel to it. Would recommended the stop there",
          "Marble Mountain was worth visiting, but it was also a bit frustrating. Not only do you need to buy two separate entry tickets for different locations on the mountain, but also a lift pass to go up, and another to go down. Felt a little like being charged any direction you turn.",
          "I was unfortunately under the impression that this was sort of a gimmick site and that was a filler stop on people\u2019s drive to Hoi An. Not the case. This stop is up there with the top spots in Hue and definitely a must see while in Danang. It has but all: history, artistic",
          "Good views to Da Nang beach. Lots of stairs and steep hills. Entrance cheap 40 000 VND. Might be a bit hot on a sunny day.",
          "I wouldn\u2019t make a special trip here unless you are in the market for marble statues (which are pretty amazing, I must admit). We did it as part of a guided day trip from Hue to Hoi An, and from that standpoint it was a nice stop. Rather touristy.",
          "We toured the grounds. There is an elevator available but there are a lot of areas you need to reach by steps. The steps are not in great shape but the effort is worth it. This is a center for buying marble even though marble is no longer mined there. You will be pounced on",
          "If it is very hot, take the glass elevator up, which cuts off a lot of your journey. One-way is sufficient because there are several ways down. Explore the caves and paths that disappear around corners. Lots to discover. Would advise taking water containers and some snacks.",
          "It is quite a busy and touristy place so go early or late, near closing time (and watch the sunset). The big cave is amazing.",
          "Nice place to visit for a few hours. Reasonably priced. Need to be reasonably fit and healthy as entrance at gate 1 is I believe 250 steps up to the top. Lovely sights of pagodas, shrines and caves. Well worth a visit.",
          "Very nice change if you want to do some small ezcercise in a city see a view. You have an option to take elevator or stairs to get to the temple, which is in the middle of the hill. A ticket is required for both options. Me and my friend got the stairs and then we got to the",
          "What an unexpected experience Marble Mountain was! Beautiful pagodas and Buddha's. Steep cave climbing. Terrific views, There is an elevator up and down. However this isn\u2019t the place for people with walking difficulties. Be sure to bring or buy water!",
          "We were so glad we decided to go to Marble Mountain. Exploring the grounds, climbing the peak, and going into the caves were all incredible. We went in not knowing what to expect, and were awe struck by the size of the statues. Highly recommend",
          "My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the marble mountains. The crowd was small and the views spectacular! Go early in the morning to miss the rush, but it takes time Ana beautiful hike and lovely sights!",
          "Nice trip close to the city, great views and interesting visit. Short fkight of steps to climb but a liftis available at extra cost.",
          "Me and my family and partner went to the marble mountains and really enjoyed it. It was beautiful. There were lots of awesome things to buy at the bottom too.",
          "This is worth a visit just to watch them sculpting the figures out of marble. Also some interesting story's from inside the mountain.",
          "This is a great experience at a very reasonable price. A bit touristy with vendors trying to sell you stuff on the way in and out. But hey - when in Rome. A lift takes you a good bit of the way up and there are nice gardens, views and caves to look round whilst there. Not",
          "This play have nothing. They have sell the elevator ticket 40.000vnd but at the top have nothing to see",
          "Our trip to marble mountains was nice. We saw a lot of nice pagodas with interesting architecture and these were all positioned in different places on the mountain. Just walking the paths leading to these are nice and a definite bonus are the walks up to the 2 viewpoints. Be",
          "A 20 minute drive south along the coast from Da Nang, Marble Mountain is worth spending an hour or two visiting. We first visited here in 2002 and were impressed with the site and since we were back in Da Nang in December 2018, decided to visit again. Like so many places in the",
          "Start at Gate 1. Entrance ticket 40k. Map with postcards 15k. Easy to follow signs. Wear comfy shoes and get ready to sweat a lot. Ice cream 20-25k. Early morning is better to avoid crouds in caves. In 2-3 h of a slow walking you arrive to Gate 2. I took motorcycle with GRAB app.",
          "This stunning area carved inside the mountain was certainly worth the trek up the massive steps. A great overview to look out as well",
          "Honestly it\u2019s too overrated. It\u2019s just a set of staircase. No real hike. Totally skippable. Go to monkey mountains instead.",
          "A must if you visit Danang. Probably the only good thing about my visit there. You should just walk up the steps if you can, entree fee is only 40,000 dong this way. There is an elevator there but you pay more and have to pay on the way down too. You could spend a good 4 hours",
          "its a super cool place. u can spend an entire afternoon here. the view is great from the top. has many things to see. wear a good shoe, as u need to walk some steps and the stairs may have water. u may use the elevator while going up and use the stairs to get down. must do in da",
          "The Marble mountains are absolutely worth a visit. Very impressive place, we probably didn't see half, took the lift up and walked down it was awesome, don't think it was necessary to actually buy other than the lift ticket as no one is checking actual tickets other than for the",
          "We are seniors and find walking up steps difficult so we were pleased to see that there was an elevator. The caves with the marble statues are worth seeing and great place for photos. Many shops in the are that sell marble pieces -most too big to pack but there is some",
          "1st take the elevator it's worth it if you are with kids. It's inexpensive and a great site to see my kids also loved it but we're not fan of the many stairs. There are caves you can see and plenty of sites to take family pictures Now like 99% of the areas you go in Vietnam the",
          "The Marble Mountains are pretty amazing and definitely worth a trip but completely overrun with hundreds of tour buses filled with Korean and Chinese tourist. My recommendation is to go early before the hordes get there.",
          "The Marble Mountains are definitely worth a visit. Be wary though that there's quite a bit of steep steps involved, some of which can be slippery. There are a lot of beautiful temples and caves to visit and it can easily take 2-3 hours for everything. There's an elevator that",
          "Place you must visit in Da Nang. We took tickets and entered by foot. It was an easy walk up, plenty of stairs but not to many. Ig you have wheelchair or you do not feel comfortable walking up take a lift.",
          "We have just returned from the Marble mountains. Spectacular natural features spoiled by too many pavement traders peddling tacky souvenirs. Fees for all steps, elevators and access to mountain of Water. Difficult to know what the different access fees should be as not that",
          "Very nice place, but crawling with Chinese tourists who are very annoying - vain, selfie stick addicts, they talk very loud, walk right in your path. It\u2019s a little hard to understand their arrogant culture.",
          "Great trip to plan when you have a view hours to spend. Beware of very clever sales ladies. Take the elevator to the top, and wander your way down, exploring caves and pagodas and beautiful nature.",
          "Nice place to go for a bit of a work out while site seeing. Can get very busy and would definitely suggest to do it on a cool day as there are plenty of stairs!! You can spend 30mins or 3 hours exploring but nothing wow spectacular to see. Few cool big caves and a pretty epic",
          "for handicapped it is limited. It has nice views of ocean and surroundings. Lots of people to see too.",
          "Expect a lot of walking, a lot of steep steps and clambering over rocks. But don't let that put you off! Amazing views! I've purposely not included any of my photos because you must go and look for yourself :)",
          "We had a nice time visiting the cave in the marble mountain (we did not take the elevator up). The cave is quite small, and you\u2019ll quickly see all of it in 15 mins or less so. However if you\u2019re willing to take the very steep (and slippery!) steps up to the top of the cave you\u2019re",
          "Our whole experience in Marble Mountain was amazing, it's a beautiful place to visit. The caves are breath taking, and the temples inside the caves were so amazing and different from all other temples. Wear comfortable shoes and expect to take many steps.",
          "This is an amazing place with a beautiful view of the city from the highest peak. The caves are great with all of the sculptures inside. There is a price to enter the mountain. There are several shops outside and inside the grounds, and they all charge tourist prices. You should",
          "Great morning outing. We caught the lift up and then spent a couple of hours walking all over the top. We climbed up to the higest point (definiltey worth the slog) and explored most of the caves. Good fun but we're glad we didn't bring our 3 year old with us as he definitely",
          "We reached around 2pm , it was a rainy & cloudy day, since we had rain coats we made it. Absolutely amazing place to spend an afternoon. Great place to visit. Opt for the lift up and there are plenty of steps for you between the caves anyway. On the mountain there are lots of",

          "We went to see this beautiful place with friends. It takes no more than 3-4 hours to see it all but definitely worth it.",
          "It was very fun hiking up the mountain. We took the elevator up to save energy and later climb down. The best view when we finished climbing gate to heaven. Excellent outdoorsy place away from the city and not so crowded by tourists",
          "There is not a whole lot to see in Da Nang itself, so if unknowingly you happened to have booked too much time there or are anyway on the road to Hoi An, I would definitely suggest stopping by. We had an extra day to kill and took the local bus to the Marble Mountains (trust the",
          "We went to the Marble Mountains this morning in a light drizzle. We initially took the elevator up. It there is no way to avoid clambering up the steep stairs. The sights are beautiful, pagodas were lovely but the paths are poorly mapped. We took a wrong turn, got slightly lost",
          "We probably chose the wrong day to go. It was raining the walkways and steps were very slippery. We couldnt explore the entire place, but went to 1-2 spots. We took the elevator while going up and coming down.",

Lots of interesting caves and temples.\n\nI came towards the end of the day, it was a nicer temperature for walking, and there were less sellers etc. Watched the sunset from the top. Had a light for coming back down.\n\nNext time I'd like to try going to sunrise :-)",

My recommendation is to wear comfortable shoes and easy-to-move outfits.",

          "Take the lift up. Great place for photos. Avoid during rain unless you are sure footed.",
          "One of the best views in vietnam. Loved crawling through the caves to reach the top. Must visit",
          "Very beautiful mountains, with some nice temples inside and caves. 2 hours is more the  enough to see everything. If visiting from Da Nang or Hoi An, take grab or taxi and pay for the entrance fee 40k VD. Much cheaper then taking a tour.",

          "Overall a decent place to visit when in Da Nang with some good views of the city and beach. Costs 40k to enter and 15k extra for lift one way if you don't want to take the stairs (pretty worth it since there's a lot of stairs).\n\nThere's a \u2026",
          "Excellent, at least 2 hours of stunning views and caves. All for 40 k. Highly recommended!",
          "Lovely views. But oh my God be prepared to walk and climbs like a thousand steps. Definitely get your exercise for the day. Bring, some water, a fan and wear comfortable shoes and loose clothing. If you go early during the day won't be as \u2026",
          "Thought it would be just a tourist trap was was actually really good. You need to be reasonably fit and sure-footed though as there are lots of steep stairways thru the marble caves. Well worth a trip nonetheless!",
          "Good place to really enjoy nature, see caves, some temples as well. But some sections are harder to climb, so I recommend not bringing the elderly or children here. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Beautiful place to take pictures and enjoy the panorama from the top. Fee 40000VD, Yellow Bus No 1 to Hoi An, 20000 VD ( maps me)",
          "Just beautiful and a great escape in the middle of a town. Just watch your step, some of the stairs done have anything to hold on to and they're step and slippery",

          "Gorgeous place and a nice hike that wasn\u2019t too strenuous. We had fun clambering through the caves. I\u2019d certainly recommend proper trail/walking shoes. If you suffer from vertigo, don\u2019t go to the top peak as the steps are very steep.",
          "You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re \u201cin nature\u201d. The mountain has been transformed into a tourist venue. Drinks stalls mid way up the mountain. There is music playing all around the mountain as if you\u2019re in a shopping mall. The caves are mediocre. There is lots of litter at the lookout at the highest peak.",
          "amazing mountain. they have an option to pay for for an elevator to go up a few flight of stairs but probably not worth it if you are young and healthy. it honestly didn't seem to go up that high. after the initial steep steps the rest of the area is relatively flat minus climbing the climbing through caves part.",
          "Amazing natural architecture, however can be tricky to scale the place because of steep steps and slippery areas. Requires minimum fitness, balance and mobility to have an enjoyable time. Great view",

          "It's one of the best places to visit in Da Nang - Hoi An area. It's peaceful , nice and serene , humans have still managed to loiter and leave trash despite of so many dustbins , but still worth a visit .",
          "I would say it's worth a visit. \nBe prepared for a lot of climbing up uneven, broken large rock steps.\nEven if you take the elevator, you'll need to negotiate many steps to look around and see each point of interest.\nMake sure you wear \u2026",
          "Nice area to roam around in for an hour or two. Better to go before 10 am to avoid the rush of people and having to wait to get through the narrow caves.",
          "I had high expectations about this place. However, it is very touristy and nothing really special honestly. There are way better places in the surroundings, in my opinion",
          "Loved it! Magical place. A lot of hidden gardens and beautiful spots to hang out... Not what you think when you think of a mountain if it make any sense :)",
          "Loved the sculptures and the view but the overpricef jewelry was insane. Beautiful pieces but wayyyyy out of my budget.",
          "Beautiful monastery in hills, enter 40 000 dong. A lot of steps, so be prepared for climbing hard.",
          "Place is okay to visit. Entrance fee not expensive. There is a cave but a bit crowned inside the cave",
          "We went in the afternoon, there were less crowds because it started raining. We were able to see most of the caves and pagodas in a couple of hours. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and clothing for hiking and climbing. The stairs are \u2026",
          "Visually quite beautiful and the caves were interesting, especially as they were used by the Vietnamese fighting the Americans (as a hospital). Quite a lot of uneven steps involved, an elevator is available for a small fee. I would not recommend if weather wet as can imagine the steps would be lethal!",
          "40k VND entry ticket and 15k elevator ticket. Takes around 2 hrs. Decent place.",
          "Great place to visit highly recommend you do as we do and set aside a few hours  to visit on way to airport",
          "Nice if you are in Da Nang but not worth a trip from Hoi An",
          "Marble mountains lies between Danang and hoi an. Unique thing about the mountain is budhha statue inside the cave. There many spots and agoda while climbing the mountain. We reached around 6 in the evening. It was quite dark by the time we \u2026",
          "Very nice in the hot hour 2-4pm, dont go there if is rainy the stairs is sleepery to much",
          "Interesting place, even despite a lot of tourist shops downstairs, which is must see in Da Nang. 40k VND entrance fee and you can spend even 2-3 hours watching pagodas, caves and really nice views from top of the mountain. Very good view on whole Da Nang, fully worth to climb up to the top.",
          "Fairly good place to visit . Just let down by not being easy to know where to go once inside. Try not to miss the Buddha statue cave here.",
          "Fantastic view from top the mountain this is actually temple in the mountain we can see so many statue inside the cave ,hv elevator for going top mountain recomended if u visit da nang",
          "Great place to explore and be careful about the slippery marbles while going up the mountain",
          "Great place to visit the mountain was a complete labyrinth of caves, view points, temples and sculptures everywhere you looked there something else. But be warned you'll need the fitness of a mountain goat cause there are hundreds of steps. But get over that hurdle and you are rewarded with a special place to visit",
          "If like me you grew up on shaolin action movies you definitely need to see this place ! Its amazing",
          "really nice but there are still trash, hope people will keep it clean in the future",
          "A beautiful place which gives quite a view from a height buy lots of climbing to do! Strictly wear sports shoes for your own safety and carry minimum stuff! A lot of steep and small steps to climb. There is a cave which was nice but freaked me out to a great extent due to the narrow passage! Be careful yeah.",
          "It's worth a visit on your way to or from Hoi An. 3 caves to visit as well as other features. But only one of the caves is worth the visit.",
          "We did a whistle stop tour of marble mountain (about an hour). It's quite impressive and some of the temples are very attractive. The caves are impressive but not of the 'OMG' variety.\n2 hours is probably a good time to visit here.\nIt's \u2026",
          "Very nice mountain, dont go if you are have injuries as it there are many stairs to walk up and down with. There are many paths to go, if you to with a tour you most likely will not get the full experience as you will not have enough time.",
          "Nice place, worth visiting if you are nearby. Kind of spiritual atmosphere which is disturbed by different kinds of music playing from various speakers at the same time around the whole area. It really starts disturbing you after a while, as the music is quite loud.",
          "Tourist place, interesting with many pagodas and statues. Worth the visit if you're in the area.",
          "Absolutely stunning , some of the climbs inside the cave are a bit tricky , but they're optional :) very busy but still a great experience",
          "equip yourself with good walking or hiking shoes.  climbing up the very narrow cave was challenging. overall nice n refreshing sight.",
          "Limestone caves here are really one of a kind. They hold years of history with bullet holes form the Vietnam war and religious monuments from Buddhism. All in all, a really cool place.",
          "It's way too touristy to my personal taste. The view is mostly of the city of Da Nang. Not too impressive. Thr pagodas etc are very nice and well maintained.",
          "Very relaxing place with a super cool view. No need to book a tour.",
          "The Marble Mountains are a cluster of five hills made from limestone and marble in Da Nang. It's also a well-known pilgrimage site with peaks, caves, tunnels and temples.\nThis is also the source of marble for statues & carving all around \u2026",

          "There is a good amount of attraction to see....make sure you check the cave out, it is really a must-see. 40k entry from the stairs, a little bit more if you want to use the elevator. Definitely worth it!",
          "Very beautiful mountains. There are apparently five in total, but I only climbed I believe one or two of THEM. Cost to enter the ones I climbed is 40,000 VND. \n\nThere's an elevator you can take up and/or down for an extra 15,000 VND, but \u2026",

          "While the first look didn\u2019t seem that great as I have visited much higher mountains but once inside, my mind changed completely. The place is amazing. Not very high though but high enough to get some amazing views of DaNang and towards Hoi \u2026",
          "Very beautiful and great views. If you are looking for caves this may not be the place. There is one small cave, but I mean quite small. Otherwise great views and alot of beautiful Vietnamese architecture. It's also quite a hike bringing \u2026",
          "Superb views over surrounding area but some of the Buddhist shrines in the caves were jaw dropping. If you've every played Lara Croft Tomb Raider you will be wanting to light the stone lanterns and constantly looking for levers, pulleys and \u2026",
          "Liked it. Use lift to go up. Great caves with Lord Buddha idols. Don't miss top view of sea and city.",
          "Worth a look. The big cave is beautiful with the light shining in. The highest peak is a workout but beautiful view from up there so worth it. Take the stairs up instead of the elevator it's only 40k each",
          "An extraordinary view to make you feel like to are in heavenly world \nThe beauty is just majestic as the name it says it .the Buddha temple and nature around it with colorful houses below is just wonderful",

          "Beware place has slippery steps. Good tourist spot",
          "Was pleasant. Lots of walkways and steps with some caves and pagodas. Beautiful nature and some reptiles. Enjoyed it and its a quick excursion from the city.",
          "I would 100% recommend this. It was a complete surprise. Looking from the outside, it didn't look like much but once you take the lift up, it never ends. There are plenty of view points but that's not even the best parts. The caves are \u2026",
          "Loved the marble mountain with all the caves and temples. Really interesting place",
          "Great place to see the caves and enjoy some peace. You can ride your way to this place. Try to avoid the tours as they cost more",

          "Nice place, 40k fee \nYou can park motorbike everywhere, dont pay them ! You can find easly free place",
          "Good exercise climbing the stairs up the mountain but too many people. Could not take a photo without someone else in it.",
          "The main cave was amazing, the rest could have been anywhere in the world. Lift in my opinion is not required. A decent level of fitness is required. I would not bring my grandparent here or small children, its a lot of climbing about.",
          "Lovely and fabulous lime and marble mountains. It is a cluster of 5 marble mountains represent for 5 basic elements to create the universe! Wood, metal, earth, water and fire. Fabulous Buhhda statues in wonderful caves!",

          "Heard so much about this place. There are many caves, but it\u2019s not. They carved the marbles from the mountain to make statues, so it\u2019s hollow inside the mountain. There are carved figures inside, and also statues placed inside. We did not \u2026",
          "We were debating going here but it was really worth the experience! The caves were the best caves we saw in Vietnam (compared to Ninh Binh and Cat Ba). The ladies at the top of the mountain selling coconuts/sodas/beers will hustle you, but I guess that\u2019s no so surprising",
          "Marble mountains is a must visit when you are in the modern city of Da Nang. There is a cheap entry fee to enter the mountain, but the views of the city and the caves inside these mountains are awe-worthy. The whole of the mountain is \u2026",

          "Very nice, it felt like there was another town up there along with caves, pagodas and temples. There are also some monkeys around.",
          "Beautiful views from the top. They have lifts to go up so ,if you don't have to walk up the stairs .Interesting old temples to see. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Danang or HoiAn areas.",

          "Well worth the entrance fee. We came in the morning so it was not too busy. There were active prayer services going on so it was a very nice experience. The only thing that would have made it better if there were English translatons for the description signs. Google translate did not do them justice.",

          "Choose a dry day for visit as steps can get slippery when wet. Generally nice place with temples, statues and caves to visit. Can pay to take an elevator up to the top to save the hike up the mountain. Pay again to take elevator down or hike your way down.",

          "Start early and walk up in shoes with good grip. It is a marble mountain and a Buddhist temple. There  are wonderful views. Take a tour if you want to learn more about the culture and how to show respect to what can be very special.I used motorcycle  tour. One tour it was called. Best day trip in 2 week holiday.",
          "Wonderful place, we only had one hour and wish we had had two at least to see everything.",
          "This place I wish I had extra days to explore. I loved this place and I hope to go again! There is so much to see and do here! Must be fit and healthy as there are stairs, many, many stairs \u2661",

          "A must visit when you're in Danang. There are many caves and spots to visit, so be sure to orientate yourself with the map before you embark on your hike. It was an easy hike too, and the lift only brings you up to the first level really, so be prepared to walk a bit still",
          "Marble mountain or water mountain.\nWhatever the name is, it is an absolutely natural place for those are interested in hiking. The place has so many caves, mountains and pagodas. Bring or buy water before entering every cave.",

          "It is a beautiful Buddhist temple located between Danang city and Hoian old town. You need to buy entry ticket 40,000 vnd and optional one way elevation ticket 15,000 vnd. However you can also take a hiking to the temple which is the the \u2026",
          "Beautiful place and something you should go check out in Da Nang. It\u2019s not a very strenuous hike up the mountains, and there is a lift to take you up if you\u2019d like that. I would recommend sturdy shoes though... there\u2019s so many caves to go explore, it\u2019ll easily keep you busy for a few hours.",
          "Don't bother with the lift unless you're physically weak. Not that hard to get to the top and the spectacular view. If you've got kids, push them a little if they're not inclined to climb, it's totally worth it. A cool weather day makes for less sweat and the same panoramic view. I went on a 17 degree overcast day, perfect.",
          "Spiritual place located around 30 mins from town, 10 mins from my khe beach, accessible by grab/taxi. Takes around 2 to 3 hours to be completed. Place isn't too crowded with ample photoshoot opportunities.",

          "This place is a typical touristic place with lots of shops and opportunities to left some money.\nFair enough for the local people but as an experience over rates. Entrance was 40.000 + parking 10.000. The caves are nice but way too crowded.",
          "We went here and it was beautiful. However lots of people made it a bit crowded. Would recommend for a walk around, the temples and caves are beautiful.",
          "Nice beautiful serene place full of pagodas & temples. About 13-14 to tick off. It's really busy...so it's better to get there nice & early or from 3pm onwards.\nTickets are 55,000 VND including one way ticket for escalator ride up. You \u2026",
          "Great if you enjoy natural beauty. Some great caves to explore. I suggest going mid day when the sun shines through the top. It involves lots of stairs. Some are very steep. You can avoid some via an elevator for 15k per trip, per person. 20k gets you in the lower caves. 40k for the upper mountain and caves.",

          "A very unique experience. \n\n40.000 VND entrance fee, bring water unless you want to pay 20- to 25.000 for 1.5L.\nA literal mountain of marble sticks out of the otherwise very flat landscape. You get to see beautiful sculptures, caves, \u2026",
          "If you not far from there it's worthy to visit. Cheap entrance if you buy tickets direct. We paid couple \u00a3 for taxi from our hotel and couple \u00a3 for entrance and glad we visited as it is one of the To Do in Da Nang.",
          "Very cool place. We went when the weather was wet and rainy, but thankfully it stopped once we arrived at the escalators. Highly recommend that you take the escalator up 50m instead of climbing the stairs as they are cut steeply and also \u2026",
          "An interesting set of mountains that are literally marble. Due to this the walking paths are slippery in both dry and wet conditions. You are best to come here in the early morning or late afternoon. Not the number one attraction, but worth a trip if you have the time as there are numerous caves, pagodas and lookouts to find.",
          "No way! was my exclamation on some of these temple/caves and I hate temples. They just get better with each one. So high and carved Buddhas in the rock and open to the sky. Magic sunset on way down",
          "Much do cave. It is worth the 20k dong per ticket. If you are not familiar with Buddhism, ask for a guide for addition 100k dong. when you get your ticket to the cave, it will give you better contact to the difference level of the cave that you see and there meaning.",
          "Danang is must visit place in Vietnam.\nYou can plan 1 day tour to marble Mountain and hoi an village.\nThere is a lift to go up. You can visit pagoda and Buddha statue inside cave. Its nice place. Lift is shut by 5 pm.\nThere are shops to buy sovereign.",

          "Nice place with a lot of nice things to see. Worth a visit, but there are too many people. Like e.g. in the caves, it is way too overcrowded. But in general a beautiful place with affordable ticket price. As a tip, take the elevator, it is \u2026",
          "Highly recommend this place for everyone who wants to visit Danang city. It\u2019s a 20 minute drive from Danang center. The Marble Mountains are largely made of a flight of stairs, temples, flight of stairs, cave temples, and a lookout point. This place has many caves, temples, trees,... Enjoy!!!",

          "Beautiful pagoda and caves. And if you get to the top beautiful views of Hoi An and Da nang. Especially at sunset.",
          "Reaching on top is a quite tough task but it's worth going there and see the beauty of nature.\nWhole danang is visible from the top",
          "Worth doing on a trip to Hoi An. Entry is only 40k and you can spend at least an hour there. No need to get the lift if you are in good shape. There are a bunch of temples, pagodas and caves to explore. The view is not great but the mountain and monuments are quite beautiful",

          "An amazing place definitely worth seeing. Only not giving five stars as can't possibly imagine how slippy it must be on a rainy day, we went on a sunny day and still had the odd slip on the marble. Quite a lot of clambering involved so take \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Beautiful views. Absolutely cannot miss this when you visit Da Nang.\n\nEasy quick taxi ride to the area. Take water and a camera! Climb and spend time taking in the views and selfies at the top!\n\nSpectacular views and lots of fun!",
          "Really great views, and lovely architecture on the pagodas. The big cave is verrrry cool. Can get really crowded at peak times on weekends. It\u2019s really fun to climb up to all the viewpoints, just don\u2019t do it after a leg workout as it is one \u2026",
          "Fascinating. Full of history. The lift takes you so far up the mountain, then you start climbing the old, uneven steps (165). Quite hard work. The caves are now temples. One was used by the Americans and there are still bullet holes in the gates leading to it.",
          "Must see place, while visiting Da Nang area",
          "This is amazing! It was beyond our expectations, with so much beautiful caves and carvings and statues around. You can easily walk around for a few hours. A must-see of you are in the area.",

          "Be careful with the vendors they may try to rip you off by giving you incorrect change if you don't pay attention with your notes. I bought water for 30k i gave them a 500k note. They tried to give me back 20k instead of 470k.",
          "Yes, there are a lot of steps and, yes, it can be tricky or slippery in places but this place is still worth the effort.\nThe toughest climb is to the viewpoint, very steep but good steps and a handrail. The 360\u00b0 view at the top is \u2026",
          "Good views. Crowded.",
          "Cave 1 is too small and climbing. It takes a long time to get Mary\n\nthe sun is strong and hot in Vietnam, ice water and sunglasses are essential.\n\nIf you like mountain climbing, it is recommended and if you do not, look around huyen khong \u2026",
          "Sometimes you travel and don't do your homework turn up somewhere and are pleasantly surprised. Well, just what happened to us with the marble mountains. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "My visit to the Marble Mountains was really nice. The views are fantastic and the entrance fee was very reasonable. I did not pay for the elevator because it literally took me two minutes to get up the stairs to where the elevator would have taken me. But I had expected that there would be a little more to see.",
          "Definitely worth a look given its so close to Da Nang City. Expect to spend a couple of hours there in total. Good workout if you visit all the different spots. Big marble trade at the base so expect to be pressured by locals. 40k VND entrance by foot, 55k VND by elevator.",
          "I love this place. Twice have been there. Early morning and late at night. Both times it's magical and beautiful. Caves, pagodas, monks make it unique. The view from the mountains is amazing!",

          "Nothing to \"play\" here! Just beautiful landscapes. Many stair steps also! :)",
          "Beautiful,2 hours trek, just a couple of difficult patches. Go up by lift and come down by stairs",
          "What an amazing place this is with rich history. There is an elevator to get up to main level but there is some walking and stairs to manage so recommend good walking shoes. There are some truly fantastic temples within the caves here.",
          "Must visit sight in Da Nang. Make sure you go well prepared: wear sports shoes for the steep climb and bring a bottle of water because you\u2019ll get thirsty from the ascent. Amazing temples, pagodas and caves, and great views from the top.",
          "Liked the view from the peak. Must come with a guide, otherwise you won't understand the full story",
          "Absolutely amazing place to spend an afternoon!\n\nThe elevator is optional, if you have small kids or a cranky spouse, the 15k price is perfectly acceptable, but honestly, walking up the staircase is far more impressive as you arrive at the \u2026",
          "5 mountains, nice place to visit at Da Nang city. If you don't want to climb the stone stair, we have elevator. It deserves to see on the top.",
          "Really unique experience, bring lots of water and cool at a cooler time of day if possible. Make you bring running shoes as there is lots of stairs and some climbing uneven slipper marble rocks. You can take the stairs up for elevator, if I remember correctly stairs are about 30k and elevator 55k in dong.",

          "Quite a collection of caves, temples, shrines, pagodas and other structures. Wear grippy, comfortable shoes as some of the trails do get quite challenging and slippery (smooth marble). There are vendors selling drinks peppered throughout \u2026",
          "Very unique, beware lots of stairs!",
          "This place is beautiful! But be prepared to sweat! The stairs are steep and big and a lot! It\u2019s worth the exercise for sure. I would give this a 5 if it wasn\u2019t for the street vendors before you get to the actual gates. They followed me the \u2026",
          "This is one of the most touristy places I have been. The views are lovely but that is pretty much it. Getting to the mountain you are bombarded by shop owners telling you to park there (if arriving on a scooter), you either pay (haggle as \u2026",
          "Great place to visit in da nang",
          "An awesome hike. Goes straight up and isn't that long. There is an elevator you can pay for if you are old or lazy. The top gives a good view and there are a few pagodas and monks around. There is one cave that makes you feel like Indiana \u2026",
          "Ancient budhist temples cut into caves.quite impressive, dating back to the 9th century. Pay for a ticket up the elevator or take the 156 steps up for free. Good views of Da Nang also from the top. Could spend quite a bit of time exploring the temples and caves.",

          "Nice view place. You can also get tired :)",
          "Marble mountains came as a pleasant surprise to me. At first when I arrived I thought you just looked at it and drove off. When I actually climbed into the mountain I was blown away by a series of caves and hidden temples. If you have some \u2026",
          "Water marble moutain enables you to visit the Am phu cave (or hells cave) and the heaven. It is a pretty good experience.\n\nThe entry of \"hell\" only costs 20.000 dong (or less than 1\u20ac). The cave is quite big, many tunnels and steps... \u2026",

          "A nice place unless you visit it during an excursion for school students",
          "Interesting place. Mountain in the middle of the city. The view and place would be much more magical without city around and just nature. However it is definitely worth of visit, there is very nice cave with Buddha statue in it and nice \u2026",
          "Overall the caves was interesting but the downside is the ticketing booth for the elevator. Those ladies in the booth treat foreigners like idoit and making rude comments in Vietnamese.",
          "Cut to the chase, here are the instructions. If you going there by a scooter, you will most likely to park in front of a Souvenir shop. The owner of the shop will give you a ticket, don\u2019t lose it cos you will need it to get your scooter \u2026",
          "It's a good time to visit here.",
          "We got recommended by the hotel manager to go to Marble Mountain so we decided to check it out as it was close by. We decided to take the elevator up which took 2 minutes! We paid 40,000 for entry fee and one way lift cost 15,000! Good \u2026",
          "Great! Should climb to the very top of the moutain",
          "If you like visit a temple this is really awesome",

          "Visit caves inside the mountain. Lots of small temple and prayers area in each \"room\". Really nice. A must do in Da Nang",
          "Spectacular and culturally significant. A very worthwhile and interesting place. \nWe walked the steps to the top and were rewarded with the caves and Buddhist temple's within. \nView's to the surrounding mountains and City were also worthwhile.",

          "Nice and beautiful place to visit when in Da Nang. Take your time and look around, there's a lot caves, temples and areas to discover. Watch your step and choose good shoes. We took the elevator up and walked down the marble stairs on the other side of the mountain. Pretty crowded since we went at noon but it didn't bother us.",
          "After reading about Marble Mountains I was interested, but not certain about what you could see and how strenuous it would be.  I have attached a map of the park below to give an overview of the sites.  I made a stop at every location and \u2026",

          "Love every form of this place and the spiritual ambience,lots of cave to explore,lots of stairs to climb and it is no joke. Lots of hikes but beautiful. Need to arrange the right time to enter the cave for a nice sunlight beam picture. It is better not to go with a tour because you will only visit one cave while there are many inside.",
          "On an excruciatingly hot day, Marble Mountains was an unpleasant experience. The view at the top of the cave climbing part was good. But, due to the unpleasant heat, and overly expensive refreshments, I would skip this, if time is of the essence.",
          "Very pretty area and amazing views with a hidden cave temple system. Quite cool.",
          "Extraordinary and easy to access. I went without a tour guide and spent two hours. I brought seperate tickets to entre cave and to go up the elevator. You probably don't have to - but I had no idea of where I was going! Wear good shoes and \u2026",
          "Great location. The uphill climb of the stairways isn't too exhausting. Don't miss to climb the \"highest peak\". A rough platform, be careful the stone is slippery even when dry. The overview of the surrounding is great. With clear sky you \u2026",
          "One of my best time in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, you get to see beautiful caves and climb up to two peaks of that mountain and enjoy the view from those peak was worth the hardship of climbing them.",
          "The large Buddha cave is impressive. However the hoards of tourists kill the atmosphere.",
          "Brought my wife here and oh boy, it was super hot and humid. The steps require proper shoes since it's pretty old and uneven.  We did get a good laugh from seeing some guy screaming like a girl because a giant tarantula climbed down the stairs in front of him unexpectedly.",
          "Great cluster of mountains. There is a elevator service available to climb the mountain at the cost of 15k VND for one way. The mountain gives a challenge to look around. Steps are slippery especially in the caves and heaven's gate.",

          "I recommend taking a grab and pass on the guided tour with a bus. Arrive by latest 8:30 am. Put on a good amount of mosquito spray and walk up the stairs. I recommend sneakers since the stairs are quite steep. It is simply more comfortable \u2026",

          "Great place to visit. Opt for the lift up ad there are plenty of steps for you between the caves anyway. On the mountain there are lots of pagodas and caves to visit.  It was bigger than I expected or that it looks from the outside! The \u2026",
          "Very touristy, not worth it if you are doing the Hai Van pass",
          "Interesting place , a couple of hours to get round it all.\nSome places take some climbing, whilst the heat can be a bit oppresive, I imagine if its rained some areas would be very difficult to get to see some places.",
          "A little bit interesting but too many people",
          "Worth a look. We had a bit to get through that day, so didn't see everything, but it was good to go too. The street hawkers are a bit persistent there, but that happens in some places. One of the cave tunnels was a bit tight and very uneven \u2026",
          "One of the tourism hotspot in Danang. Entrance fee is 40k to walk up, a little more of you want to take the lift up. Honestly the walk up is not bad. Quite busy so try to go early in the morning. A few caves and pagodas across the mountains. Interesting but not mind blowing.",
          "Nice calm and relax place. Just sit down chill and listen the Munk chanting. The pagode is very beautiful. Don't run away after making 2 pics.",
          "The view from this mountain is excellent.",
          "It's really peaceful. You have to go there if you visit Danang",
          "Also known as Water Mountain, due to the fact there are 5 mountains and are named after the elements. Once on Marble Mountain, there are caves and pagodas to explore.",
          "Good place with temples / paintings and a nice view below. There are caves too, but navigating them is not easy.  One can use the elevator to climb up and even to come down if needed...A good place if you have free time in hand on \u2026",
          "Very touristy the whole thing. Not impressed but the view from above and pagodas are nice to see!",
          "Very interesting to visit. Super hot when we were there. Loads of stairs, so be aware! Loved going with a guide so we understood more about what we were seeing.",
          "Need leg strength\nCaved budh \nBeers for drinkers\nMust visit with your love ones",
          "Well worth a visit! Lots of stairs, so bring water and good shoes.\n\nTakes around 2-3 hours to explore it all, and you get lots of beautiful views from the different viewpoints. Cave #10 is the most beautiful.",
          "Worth a visit but abit of a tourist trap. Very busy and they constantly play music in the area so it feels like a theme park rather than somewhere with history. Some of the caves are very impressive.",
          "Definitely worth the stop. Takes about 2 to 3 hours to enjoy the whole mountain. Lots of places to explore. Impressive caves. Calming. Beautiful pagodas. Close to both Hoi An & Danang. To avoid the heat go either early morning or late evening. Bring along water. There are marble shops below if you are looking for that sorta thing.",
          "You can't even imagine how those secretive caves hide magnificent pagodas and Budha statues.  It looks like out of a fairy tale of long forgotten worlds. Up the mountain between the 2 heaven gate gives you a great majestic feeling.",
          "One of the best attractions close to Da Nang. Spectacular sights with some challenging climbs. Culturally rich with beautiful artwork and sculptures inside.",
          "Great view of the area and interesting (yet very small caves). A number of shrines and a  climb through the cave to the very top for not of a faint hearted. Hint: there is another way up with more normal stairs; of you are feeling \u2026",
          "A must visit in Da Nang! The hike up is soothing and takes you away from the busy city. Caves inside are humongous and one should visit those as well.",
          "We didn't know what to expect and it was surprising that there were big caves inside the quit small looking mountains. Wasn't too crowded even there were public holidays. The price is 40k Dong per person and an extra 15k for the elevator one way so it wasn't too bad. The toiletries there are some kind of s**hole by the way.",
          "Make sure to wear comfortable shoes because you will be walking a lot. Prepare to sweat and be breathless after this trip because it is a workout especially in this heat. There are a lot of caves, shrines, temples, and viewpoints. I would \u2026",
          "An excellent must-see place in Da Nang. Get a taxi to go there and it is always better to go there early morning. Entrance fee is 20,000 vnd (something less than 1 usd). The climb is little steep but easily manageable. I saw many kids and adults climb this. You can see nice statues and carvings made out of marbles.",
          "Great place to spend a couple of hours and see some interesting temples in large mountain caves and great viewpoints of the surrounding cities of Da Nang and Hoi An. There are very few English signs and although there is a map at several points it's not clear how to see all of the temples and pagodas.",
          "Hidden gym. Absolutely gorgeous.",
          "Love it but the lift will be closed at 17.00\nWe brougth ticket 15,000/1 round but we couldn't take the lift down due to it's close before we get there.\nMap with postcard is also selling at the ticket booth normally they should give it for \u2026",
          "The mountains are beautiful, but they are surrounded by shops, who's employees will harass you to no end to buy their overpriced merchandise. I've had one follow me to and from downtown danang on her moped, and wouldn't leave me alone. I \u2026",
          "FYI, the ticket for the lift only takes you to the first level of the mountain. If you're able to take stairs from the outset, it saves you the cost of a ticket and only takes 5minutes. The highest point has quite nice views but for a decent photograph from on top of the cave, you'll have to walk to the very edge of the rocks.",
          "Definitely worth seeing. Beautiful place run by monks with temples, caves and waterfall. Easy to get to (bus no 1, motorbike). Main entrance with lift, also good entrance from the other side (successive climbing up to the hill - less occupied by tourists).",
          "If you love caves and don't mind done Rock scrambling and lots of stairs, this place is for you. The carvings are just incredible! Expect to spend a few hours here",
          "Nice place but need more energy to walk around and climb",
          "Awesome hikes and beautiful caves. Park your motorbike for free at any of the marble shops.",
          "Stunning views amazing caves. Quite a strenuous climb to the top, but worth it",
          "I love Vietnam. Leaving Vietnam felt like leaving home, friends and family for the first time, I had tears! Vietnamese are wonderful people(mostly). Marble mountain is worth every dong spent. It was very very hot so take loads of icy water \u2026",
          "This mountain is filled with interesting caves and temples, totally should visit. A good climb up the mountain but it also has an elevator to get up and down.",
          "A marvelous mountain to have some exciting time. Not good for summer time.",
          "Religious. Beautiful. Inexpensive. Bring cash for site admission. They charge you to go to the top and again to go into the cave.",
          "It has interesting routes to the peak, and it may be slippery at some parts, recommended to wear covered shoes if you want to visit more than just the temple and pagoda at that place. Attraction has an option to purchase lift ticket but it does not take you to the highest point.",
          "The place is really nice but GARBAGE EVERYWHERE! \nAND MAINLY IT S GARBAGE FROM THE LOCALS WHICH I FIND REALLY BAD... Even on top of the mountain there s trash left from whoever is supposed to mantein the place...",
          "It's hot, but it's green and it's relaxing, but there's a lot of risk of pickpockets.\nIf you're lucky, I can say hello to the monkey.",
          "Visiting the cave in the surrounding is nice but don't try to get to any difficult peak for view because it's been spooked by developments....\"eye sore\" really when you look out",
          "It was a wonderful trip. We took about 3 hours to explore every caves and reach to the peak of the mountain. The view was amazing and enormously beautiful. Make sure to bring along your hat, sneakers and some water as it was genuinely hot \u2026",
          "The marble mountains are gorgeous! Please skip the elevator if you do intend on visiting (unless health reasons prohibit you from hiking obviously). There are several temples and resting areas providing sweeping views of the nearby sea. It \u2026",
          "Beautiful mountains jutting out in the middle of the city. Formed by the ocean thousands of years ago, there are high ceilinged caves and marbles Buddas. Well worth a visit.",
          "A really cool place in da nang. Fairly inexpensive for some of the best views of the city. The terrain is tiring, if you're trying to get to any of the attractions expect steep and inconsistent steps that will tire you out.\n\nIt was well \u2026",
          "Best place to look inside yourself",
          "Really cool , but its quite a hike . Bring running shoes . Still doable in flipflops",
          "Not my forte. Mostly Chinese temple. Relaxing... a little bit of walking and climbing stairs",
          "Great views at the end of a light upwards hike. There are some great Buddhist sculptures and buildings all over this location",
          "Gives a good view over the city and beach. Interesting temples and many good photo opportunities. Be prepare for a lot of steps -  shorts and shoes are must.",
          "Great views, and many photo spots.\nThe entry ticket is 45000vnd and for elevator ticket (one way) is 15000vnd. You can spend around 2hours in this place. Explore and you may find many interesting photo spots! The highest peak is definitely a must-go spot! You can view the whole Danang city on the peak!",
          "Climbing to the top was great! There is a nice view from the top but what I enjoyed the most was the climbing part through the caves!",
          "We decided to walk up rather than take the lift. Views are spectacular. Amazing place, fantastic carvings and the way the light comes into the cave makes wonderful.",
          "Tourist Spots have been Visualised and Developed well here in Vietnam. This is one such famous Tourist Spot for Visitors.\nThis place cleverly Exploits the Dotted Hill Landscape of the Country and gives an Elevated View of the City in all \u2026",
          "We took our kids after a day of travel from Hue. We were a bit tired to really enjoy it but I can imagine if you had a whole morning or afternoon it would be fantastic. We loved going in the caves.  It was very busy and there were lots of \u2026",
          "Gorgeous view. Lots of climbing and it's very hot on most days. Be sure to stay hydrates. Drink lots of fluids.",
          "It\u2019s worth visiting\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "A fun experience of jumping on the elevator to the ridge.\nThe top of the mountain, which appears when passing through a small passage in a bat cave,\nA Buddhist cave with remains of the Vietnam War.\nEveryone is a great experience, but the scenery that appears when you climb the pagoda is an unforgettable beauty.",
          "Interesting rock formations with many carvings and tributes inside the caves. Entry fee was about 30000dong, with under 6s free. The stairs to the top are extremely steep, but the entrance to the cave is accessible up a moderately difficult 25 steps/ramp. It was a little slippery so be careful on the way in.",
          "VND 40000 Entry fee. Definitely worth it if you're in Danang. Make time to walk around and through the many Caves. As a bonus there are a zillion shops with the Most amazing statues and artwork in marble. The sizes and quantities are mind \u2026",
          "Just make sure you dodge all the Peddlers on your way there and you could have a pretty great experience. Could be spiritual if you happen to catch a time when there aren't many tourists.",
          "Marble Mountain was worth visiting, but it was also a bit frustrating. Not only do you need to buy two separate entry tickets for different locations on the mountain, but also a lift pass to go up, and another to go down. Felt a little like \u2026",
          "It was dirty and unkempt. The staff appear disinterested in explaining. There is hardly a view because the sea is blocked by a humongous construction. I wouldn't go even if it is free.",
          "Good and Beautiful!",
          "Skip the elevator. Go up the stairs. Bring water and sunscreen. If you enjoy a day of climbing this is for you",
          "Beautiful view, buildings, caves, pagodas. You can access by stairs or elevator, but even if you go by elevator you must climb a lot of stairs to go to the places. Good place to stay for 1-2 hours. You can buy food and drinks.",
          "I'm giving it one star based on the hype. I feel that a place like this should not have an entrance fee. It's nature and they aren't offering a service so why pay? It's a beautiful place ruined unfortunately by the crowds of humans with \u2026",
          "On a beautiful day, the view is exotic and breathtaking. It can be quite crowded and we were warned of pickpocketing but felt it was generally safe. Go in the morning so the sun is behind you to get the best shot of the valley with the lime stone outcroppings.",
          "Amazing caves and views. Must see.",
          "Really very good mountain to track through visiting many caves as well scenic view of Da Nang from all the four side and enjoy the photography as well as have good excercise",
          "Beautiful nature. You could get there for 0.35 cents googling public transportation which was a fun thing to do all on its own. Wear comfortable shoes and water there is very expensive so bring your own bottle. There were hidden caves within hidden caves \ud83d\ude2e",
          "Did not get to visit this, only had a glimpse from our bus.",
          "You'll get sweaty but the view is awesome and the main cave is breathtaking when the light falls through the gaps",
          "It is a really nice place to visit, especially when you travel from Da Nang to Hoi An. You can ask your taxi driver to make a stop at the Marble mountains, and then order a new taxi or let him wait. I believe it is worth your experience in middle Vietnam.",
          "Bit of a tourist trap. Agressive peddlars and vendors  everywhere, but a good cultural experience. Need to be quite fit to crawl and climb around the place, but very beautiful. Well worth the price of admission.",
          "Check this place out if you're in Da Nong. Definitely wear decent footwear as there are a lot of steps. Viewpoint right at the top has some outstanding views of Da Nong. Don't get baited in by the local woman trying to make you park in their shops for 'free'. Park in any of the side streets or in the main car park.",
          "The place reflects every bit of the culture vietnam has to offer. There are different peak spots you can go to in the mountain to see the landscape of the city. A little bit tiring but it's worth it.",
          "Very interesting place. You get to see a lot of Buddhist sculptures in every nook and cranny of the cave wall. Once you get to the top, there are pagodas and temples on the mountain top and many lookout towers to watch both sea to the east \u2026",
          "It's nice place to see while come to danang",
          "Lovely place. Really a must see in Da Nang. It is a big complex of caves and temples and the view from the top is really breathtaking. Don't listen to the people saying it's nothing special cause it's definitely worth a visit!",
          "an amazing beautiful view of DaNang city and beach area ... should also explore the caves, pagodas and temples inside ... a must visit in DaNang ...",
          "Beautiful place to visit;take your time to walk around and take care when entering the caves:some parts are abit slippery. There are chairs for you to take a rest",
          "Great walk .. great sights .. if you want some trinkets best to visit the bigger shops outside and barter barter barter .. if there's one thing these guys are good at its negotiating.. they have been doing it day in day out for many years. Thnx Dong for my purchase of a lovely chinese drink set.",
          "I definitely enjoyed this place. So many cool  caves and small temples etc to take pictures of. I rented a scooter in Da Nang and I would say it's the easiest and quickest way to visit the mountains (but if you haven't driven bigger bikes \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit if you are nearby Da nang city. If you want to visit, you should be patient. Early in the morning will be the best moment. Otherwise, late evening at sunset. If you go there with scooter or private car, just avoid \u2026",
          "A great gem and worth a visit if you have the time. It wasnt too busy and the walk was rather easy so no need to wait for the elevator unless you're old, injured or fat.",
          "It was the good experience at the early morning, We like the place itself but not  small shops in front. They tell us 10,000 vnd/ice cream but after you take it they will say whatever price they wanna",
          "Fun cool place. 5 different mountains, I believe you can only access one, if you show up before 8 am you can probably get away with not paying the $2 Canadian entry fee LOL. Cool Little 'finds' here and there as you walk around, Buddha's in caves, Grotto's, shrines, nice views - fair amount of stairs to climb.",
          "The entrance fee was very affordable and the views this place give is astonishing. This place affors cultural heritage of the vietnamese people for many decades.",
          "Beautiful. Be sure to arrive early; by 9:30 all the groups artive. Just 10 min from Da-nang city. Entrance fee only 40k.",
          "This place is amazing and cheep too. You need to go up the lift after going in the first cave. As a caver I'm usually annoyed by things done to show caves but these are great, the health and safety police have not yet spoilt this lot, you \u2026",
          "Great place, great views",
          "Wonderful unique mountain in a flat area near the sea. Multiple sets of stairs give access to the summit. 15,000VND for the elevator each way. 40,000VND entry ticket. Many, caves, temples and viewing points to enjoy for a couple of hours.",
          "Hard work but worth it.",
          "Beautiful place. Definitely my favorite place to go in Da Nang",
          "Lovely place to explore. Only downside are the dishonest aggressive sellers at the base who will boldly lie to you regarding their products. Don't buy!",
          "Great place to visit. Very hot. Recommend wearing light clothing and comfortable shoes. Local store holders are a little pushy at times.",
          "Quirky place to spend a few hours. Beautiful temple complex on top, fantastic views, but the most impressive bits lie beneath the ground! Some of the caves here are amazing and almost like cathedrals in their enormity! Make sure you bring plenty of water though as you will get hot with the climbing!!",
          "Good place to visit in Da Nang.  Definitely take the elevator up and down if you travel with older people. The climb is doable for a four year old. Kids really enjoy it. It's scenic but not spectacular. Go early morning to beat the crowd and the hot sun in summer.",
          "Caves are all natural, it's so cool when you step inside. Nothing much to do here. Entrace fee is 40k, 15k for elevator. Steps are a bit high and steep, you should mind your steps. Bottle water is extremely expensive, 40~45k. Bring your own \u2026",
          "You think you know what a cave is and then you come here and you realize you knew nothing.",
          "Nice view..need to carefull on the step..worth the money and sweat",
          "So so for me. Halong bay caves are way more impressive",
          "Steps steps steps. Don't get ripped off by vendors",
          "Parking is not clearly marked for bikes. I paid a lady 5K to park outside her cafe. We drove up from Hoi An, easy 20 minute drive. Entrance is 40K and 15K for the elevator. Which it totally worth it on a hot day. No queues. \n\nQuite a few \u2026",
          "Don't pay for parking. There's a public parking on the site. There's also a Vinmart directly on the site if you want some water, way much cheaper. Be smart!",
          "Just gorgeous. Be prepared to climb the steps.",
          "Nice area to walk one loop from either entrance, quite touristy nowadays but still worth a stop if you are in Danang.",
          "This place looks like a hill. You can choose to go up by walking or by elevator (additional ticket fee), but you have to go down by foot. I came here a liitle late, around 4.30pm so it became a little dark in the cave. There are caves, Buddha statue, temple inside. Better bring umbrella because it was rainy when i came.",
          "Amazing place made by nature and humans.\nPictures attached.\n\nTickets price: 30.000 VND\nLift: 15.000 VND but you can take steps. Lots of them :-)\n\nYou better have at least regular, solid shoes. Not flip flops.\nLots of slippery steps and \u2026",
          "Lots of good views. Has caves , pagodas and steps which lead to scenic views from the top. Walk up is easy. Don't bother taking the elevator. Wear shoes",

          "Great views and fun to scramble around",
          "Nice and not that bad of a hike but you need proper  sneakers, not sandals",
          "There are lots of local people who want you park motorcycle in their place just for 5.000 VND. But you can park everywhere for free. \nYou can choose if you pay for a lift or go on the stairs. There are many caves and temples. \nIt is a nice place for visit.",
          "Very worth to go. Just VND 40K.  walk up to the top is ok."

We paid 500kvnd extra for Centre stage but I would recommend against this option as the venue is small",

          "It is a shame to say the show was average, as all things leading up to it looked promising. The beautiful bamboo dome, ticket service, welcome drinks and talented performers. Tickets were expensive but we felt it was worth a try with all the glowing reviews online. For us, the",

          "My family of 4 adults went to see the AO show and left very disappointed. I guess it wasn't our cup of tea because I saw other people enjoying the show. I usually enjoy cultural performances but this felt amateur-ish, almost like a high school performance. It didn't make much",

          "This show was entertaining. The music is probably the best part about it as the musicians are extremely talented and some play extraordinary instruments that are not widely known within the music scene. The show itself was good, but I wouldn't recommend the VIP seats as I feel",
          "Perhaps I\u2019m jaded by having seen similar kinds of performances in other places around the world, but this one lacked the fire, intensity and execution I had expected. The choreography and lighting are great, but the pace can be slow and\u2014frankly\u2014tedious. I was in a party of six;",

          "I bought the expensive seats, what waste of money the cheaper seats are just as good, though you get a complimentary glass of wine. The show in some parts was fast and exciting but for large chunks of the hour long show it was slow and pedestrian I started to nod off a few times",
          "We saw the Palao show and were very positively surprised. If you have some time you can have a look at it.",
          "We literally saw the ads for this show everywhere in town and decided to give it a go. The show is not bad, but for such a price we would rather spending our time hitting a few bars in town.",
          "Absolutely amazing choreography. Comtemporary but rooted in tradition. Fierce, sensual, funny, acrobatic. The dancers were incredibly talented, and the staging outstanding. Only white was used in costume and silken banners. Clay pots, from tiny to ginormous, were the only props.",
          "Really innovative performance that combined both contemporary and traditional. Aesthetically pleasing. The show we saw tackled some really challenging issues about the transition from rural life to urban life. A really classy performance and not just a tourist trap or a theme",
          "You need to do some reading about the Champa people before you attend the show. Free welcome glass of wine was a treat!",
          "Palao is the 3rd show I've seen from Lune Production. In comparison, Palao stands out with its very contemporary concept of dance, stage design and music. I enjoyed the show a lot, the materials that are used for the stage (white fabric falling weightlessly down from the ceiling",
          "If you're looking for comedy or something for kids, this is not a right choice. Palao is visually satisfying, intense and touching. The whole performance makes me FEEL. Love the sharing between the dancers and the audience after the show! A lot of insights make the show more",
          "Come here follow the recommendations of lady at 5 senses spa and the show was great. This is the best place to go for an art show",

          "We watched My Village in Hanoi the week the before and we had loved the performance. So when we found the beautiful bamboo dome theatre while cycling along the river in Hoi An and read the group was performing, of course we had to go! And it was truly amazing! The performance",
          "We came here to see a Cirque de Soleil-style feat of incredible, baffling acrobatic performance and absolutely loved it. Whatever you see here, it's a lovely venue with great views from wherever you sit. Probably not worth shelling out for the most expensive 'Wow- tier seats",
          "Took the family to see the Teh Dar performance and we were all blown away. The acrobatics and choreography were wonderful and could not recommend this highly enough - one of the best things we did in Vietnam. The show only goes for an hour but it's time and money well spent.",

          "A fantastic show , must see . Beautiful performance with symbols of Vietnam in different periods of time ...",
          "For the price that was paid i felt it could of been longer. Having said that we did go to memories of hoian 2 nights before and paid almost the same and i felt it was better value. If the price was lower it might attract more people",
          "We loved this show. Full of acrobatics, modern dance and mime, the performers were very talented and entertaining. It is not always on in Hoi An sometimes the performance is on in Ho Chi Minh City by Saigon Opera Company. The show goes for about 90 minutes. We bought tickets",
          "It's really great show. Performance , Music & light were pefect. It's the best experience in Hoi AN. but, some customers were comming after show begin again and again. it's the only one dissatified thing.",
          "This was a performance of the arts which included modern dance, theatre, mime, acrobatics with the use of traditional musical instruments. Well worth the money.",
          "What an amazing show! Totally transfixed for the whole show Talented performers Definitely a must. Any seat will give you a great view, no need to purchase the Wow seats unless you want to",
          "A cultural show depicting the history of Vietnam, with a mixture of music, dance, humour and spectacular acrobatics. At times I didn't really get the meaning of some sets but that didn't detract from the enjoyment of the show. Probably the most expensive thing we did in Hoi An,",
          "This show is awesome: perfect mix of modern dance/acrobacy and tradition. Great choreography and wonderful dancers - a highlight of our stay in Hoi An!",
          "This show touched my heart. Felt amazed by those talented performers! It was genius, historical, modern, funny - surely made all audience happy! Congratulations and keep this positive energy. This spectacular performance should be seen by all visitors in HoiAn!",
          "We went to the cultural show and expected it to be like many other shows we have seen in other places. The performers were so skilled that we were mesmerised. It was a mixture of dance and circus skills and told the history of Vietnamese people. This is great for any age.",
          "Even though the narrative part of the show is of course conducted in Vietnamese we all easily followed the story. Beautiful production, well executed and everyone in the crew seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. There's a real tinge of sadness to the story seeing the",
          "Amazing show every little piece from welcome to end was flawless, personal touch, really talented performers",
          "Positioned on the end of Hoi An Island overlooking the water is the dome shaped performance stage. This is a clever group of very flexible and fit performers who tell the story of Vietnamese people from the inception of life to modern day with very little props other than woven",
          "When coming to review, i read the not so good ones only and found that it was pretty weird with some of the comments. I myself and many of my friends enjoyed every second of it. Thank you so much for the fabulous night. Thank you also Henritours for the great recommendation!",
          "This show was amazing!. In different sketches you see a story how a small village is build up in a big city. As a foreigner you still understand what is happening. And everything is in this show. With basic simple materials they do their acrobatics and there is also sing and",
          "Whether you live in Viet Nam or are visiting, If you miss seeing the AO production you're really missing something special. I first saw this show about 6 years ago in Sai Gon and was thrilled with it then. The most recent production I saw was in Hoi An and the purpose built",

          "Nice to do something different. Very good show, great for famiies with multi talented artists. Nice touch at end where opportunity to get photos & meet them all. One tip- no need to pay for high price seats as theatre is so small it doesn't matter where you sit!",
          "Line production is always doing amazing job! I loved The Dar as a performance of the highest scale and waited to see how AO will live up to that. It was very amusing and unexpected show with clever play of tradition and innovation in Vietnam",

          "This show was actually fantastic. I was very cynical going into it as I usually hate any kind of theatrical anything - corny musicals are my idea of hell. This, however, was anything but. It had acrobatics, humour, even beatboxing - it was very entertaining from start to finish.",
          "Excellent performance by very skilled dancers. No need to get the expensive seats though, the theater is really small and you can see well from anywhere. Highly recommend",

          "A must see performance. Dragged my reluctant family along to the AO Show in Hoi An. We were all thrilled with the experience and haven\u2019t stopped talking about it. Definitely one of the highlights in our holiday in Vietnam. (Kids aged 12. 10. 9.)",
          "This was beautiful and dynamic ! Actors have multiple skills and never let the spectator uninterested",

          "\"A must see\" in deed. The performance is great. Passionate, professional, funny, full of love and very talented casting. One of the best shows I've ever seen.",
          "Following my friend\u2019s advice to see the show without any explanation given... Just knowing that it is a performance with acrobat style. Well... It is like watching British Got Talent show only that it is the full hour long. The act started off of way of living in the past",
          "An ideal small intimate space for the type of performance. Hard working and talented individuals who are wonderful entertainers! Highly recommended to anyone interested in a contemporary Vietnamese cultural experience.",

          "Only an hour long so it held the kids' attention. Some traditional and modern performances. Very talented. Even our hard to impress teenagers enjoyed it! It's only a small venue do the cheap seats are still great visabilty",
          "I greatly enjoyed this show. The same show was offered in the Opera of Saigon but I was unable to get a ticket; thus, I was very happy to see that Hoi An gave me a second chance. The show was beautiful, inspired in Vietnamese culture but also very creative and to some extent,",
          "We are so glad the hotel staff told us about this show. To find a show of this caliber in tiny Hoi An was great. It\u2019s in an amazing small Bamboo dome. The stage possibly takes up almost a third of the space so you simply can\u2019t get a bad seat as it\u2019s such an intimate venue. The",
          "A very energetic, fun performance for all ages describing life in Vietnam through music, acrobatics and dance. My teenage daughters were originally sceptical but loved it and thought it was one of the highlights of a lovely trip to Vietnam.",
          "A great mix of athleticism, acrobatics, dance and performance. Modern and traditional music seperate and combined. A wonderful historical journey with some humour thrown in for good measure.",

          "This show combines nicely Vietnamese motives, acrobatics, music and even few funny moments. We feel that the length of it is just right (one hour) and we were very happy to see it. If you will arrive few moments before you will even get refreshing drink. As said by others we",
          "Watched Ao show with family truely amazing.Incredable acrobatics and story to go with it.Whole family enjoyed from parents,teens to 9 year old",
          "A great show and a great venue. Really unusual and worth the money. I\u2019m glad I went but I think they do something similar In HCMC too",
          "We went to see the AO Show. It was a wonderful performance! The acts were stunning, the cast did a phenomenal job, and the story was a great look into the evolution of Vietnamese culture!",
          "What a spectacular show! A must see if you are in Hoi An old town. The show was fantastically put together with great acrobats, musicians, lighting and done with so much charm and humour. Great show for the whole family. It's a very small theatre, so all seats are good.",
          "Some of the more artistic numbers indeed reminded me of this famous cirque. Half of the show was more traditional and another half very modern - both were skillfully executed and fun. There are virtually no \"bad seats\" in the theatre and it was air conditioned which is a big",
          "Went to a live show here at the Center. While I enjoyed the show I feel for an hours duration the show was expensive.",
          "We saw the AO show here and were amazed by it. The talent here is great, the story that was told and the acreoabatics that were displayed meshed together very well and it makes me want to go again. Highly recommend going here to see a show if you are staying near Hoi An",

          "Loved the show! The performers were outstanding, the theater was intimidate so everyone felt right in the action, and the staff was helpful and welcoming. It was a little over an hour long and was a great way to kick off a night in Hoi An. The athletic and musical feats",
          "Watched the AO show here on June 14. Air con was sufficient to keep the venue cool. Close proximity to the stage gave it a more intimate experience. Sound system could be quite loud at times though. Was offered a refreshment tea prior to the performance and had a photo",
          "Had a fantastic and entertaining time. No need to understand vietnamese; show lasts about an hour (perfect before diner). Definitely worth it. The venue is really small so the cheapest seats are as good as the priciest one except if you really want to face the main stage. Show",
          "What an exhilarating, energetic performance in such a small space! The cast of this traditional/cultural show were AMAZING! ! The energy, the choreography, the music and enthusiasm has to be seen to believed. The dome theatre is very comfortable, with air conditioning. Highly",

          "We bought 4 x tickets for this show last Monday 18.06.18. That night there was a tremendous storm in Hoi An and we were struggling to get to the show on time. I rang the box office to be told we couldn't change the ticket time so we needed to use the tickets that night. These",

          "A must see show indeed! I booked tickets online one day ahead. My kids are 8 and 5 years old and both enjoyed the show. Vietnamese music, lifestyle was represented in a show with a bit of humor. Highly recommend it! Tip: book the row F, that way if there are empty seats in E row",
          "I went to the A O Show with my 19-year old daughter last week. It was excellent and definitely worth our time. The building is air-conditioned and comfortable. The acrobats are extremely talented! The only thing I would caution against is buying the most expensive \u201cWow\u201d tickets.",

          "We watched AO show on 10 June in Hoi An. Thoroughly enjoyable! This is a world class performance that deserves international attention. My children (age 5 and 8) were enthralled. We have watched many similar shows including Cirque Du Soleil. This is more than comparable, more",

          "your performance is so excited. I believe you will do your best in the other shows, such as Teh Dah, etc. thanks for your effort",
          "Very entertaining. To call them a Vietnamese version of Cirque du Soleil is a closest description but would do them unjustice. Highly creative (and I have watched a fair number of performances from other groups). Visually interesting. Fun and funny at times. My review is for the",
          "The first time I watched this show. wow Amazing with all young talent artists. You will miss out a whole lot if not seeing this amazing show.",
          "Probably went in with a western attitude that the show would be full of death defying stunts and acrobatics that would rival Circ du soliel, which in hindsight is not a fair comparison. The show is full of culture and comedy and a few impressive acrobatic moments that make it",
          "If you\u2019ve been to the Phare circus in Siem Reap, this is right on par. Brilliant choreography and use of light. Talented young artists (dancers, acrobats, singers and musicians), all tucked in a unique theatre. Only a 5 min stroll from the old town, it\u2019s a must see of Hoi An.",

          "Hotel staff recommend us this show for night activities we think it was a bit expensive but we tried to see something different the show was really impressive and very talent performers. Our idea that the explanation in English will make the show perfect.",
          "I was blown away by this show. I didn\u2019t know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with how captivated I was from the start. I can\u2019t imagine anybody being disappointed! Amazing talent, coordination, movement, and music. It was a really great portrayal of the complexity",
          "We were impressed by the athletic choreography. The young people in the show work hard to put on an entertaining show through dance, drama and gymnastics. The production team needs to add projected English subtitles (such as the Cambodian Circus uses in Siem Reap), which would",
          "This was a great experience and well worth the ticket! Performers were very talented, the show was fast-paced with incredible acrobatics, and the music, particularly the drumming, was amazing! Our 6-yead old was mesmorized throughout the whole show. The pictures are from outside",
          "Teh-Dar show is a super highly recommended show if you have a chance to visit Hoi An. It\u2019s all about the stories and life of ethnic minorities in the Central of Vietnam. The whole show is performed by real talented people with exotic Vietnamese tribal instruments and mesmerizing",

          "What an energetic and spectacular performance. I was on the edge of my seat watching incredible acrobatics and movements. The drums and other instruments matched the cultural theme, this show is worth every dollar and, it\u2019s a MUST See whilst visiting Hoi an",

          "We loved this show!! theatre is small and cosy with a great view from any seat. Performers were incredible!",
          "The venue is so refreshing with a modern fusion with Vietnamese culture and surprisingly big inside. Tickets are reasonable with a choice of type to include drinks, pay more for alcohol as expected. Make sure you get to your seats early because once the lights go out it's very",
          "Every second and penny worth. I have no words to describe how amazing the show was. The Teh Dar show is about the central highland culture. I think being a Vietnamese (and special to born in mountain and lived my childhood with ethnics) is an advantage. The show get me in a",

          "I am recommended from my friends about the show called Teh Dar, it is about the culture of the hill tribe in central highland of Vietnam and I really love it. I am very appreciated that Lune Production brings it to the stage to introduce to friends around the world. As its",

          "I was speechless after the show. The experience was so overwhelming that it needed time to sink in. I was admiring from above but was also in the act. Seats are clustered and close to the stage, which forges a sense of belonging and involvement among the audience themselves and",

          "Outstanding, magical evening. We loved the whole performance. Language doesn\u2019t matter, this works for everyone. Too bad we could hear music from another venue, when the intimate performances were on it was a distraction. Overall well worth seeing. Highly recommend",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

          "To get to the Chams, you can take a fast boat or the ferry. Go by ferry. It takes about 2.5-3 hours depending on the sea currents. The charm is watching everything being loaded not only at the wharf but en route from other boats. We had chickens, geese, pigs, food stuffs,",

          "We stopped in for lunch which was included in our Dive and Snorkelling trip. The food was beautiful and the amenities are good. Lots of chairs on the beach to sit back relax and enjoy the view",

          "The adventure started the minute we got on the bus. A quick trip to an interesting harbour where we watched other boats go out and locals fishing as we motored to Cham Island. Our guide provided information about the region and how the people live. The island is spectacular. We",

          "This place is so nice when you stay away from the main beach in town. My advice, stay at homestay, hang out with local people, go to hidden beach. The island is lovely in the afternoon when tourists are back to Hoi An and Danang",
          "A quiet little island, with about 2000 inhabitants, didn't disappoint. The little museum about marine life around was informative, small shops with souvenirs and the lunch provided by the tour operator were nice. The snorkelling experience was average as we could hardly see any",
          "Finally made it out to Cham Island. It was beautiful, with a quiet, peaceful beach and some good snokelling. We probably didn't need to stay overnight - a day trip would have sufficed - but it was a very relaxing break nonetheless.",
          "We've arrived there after a boat trip including snorkling. Beautiful scenery but not much to do besides eating and drinking at the beach. I wouldn't go there by myself, but as a part of a tour is a great location. The food was very good tho.",
          "Turistic, nothing really worth the visit. The snorkelling is nothing special, stay on. the island is dedicated to lunch ( was ok) and to visit a village. The museum is orribile, skip it",

          "After the driver picked us up we collected a few more people, then were taken to the boat harbour where we ran the gauntlet of a myriad of stall holders trying to sell us sarongs, snorkels, dodgy plastic telephone covers etc. The snorkels we bought for the kids broke before",
          "Went for a short trip. Only 15 minutes traveling by Ship. It a small green island with mostly preserved nature (the sea, the mountain). Only 3000 people live there, so there has a clean and fresh atmosphere. There are several activities which you can do there like swimming,",

          "The best part of visiting the Cham islands was the speedboat after that there was nothing to rave about. Firstly the tour bus was over an hour late picking us up and the driver didn't seem to know where he was going. The tour guide said it we would do a 3k walk around the",

          "Sea nothing more than a soup of plastic detritus. Beach the same with a festering open sewer towards the left hand end. I visited the Gilly Islands many years ago and this Cham Island experience was a reminder of that pitiful place and how paradise can be utterly trampled on",

          "My wife and I visited the island today in what was perfect weather. Too many overcrowded boats and so much rubbish everywhere. It's in the water and on the beach and spoils what is clearly a beautiful place. If there were more rubbish bins on the beach I'm sure the issue",
          "The tours charge way too much for a dull experience. The speedboats stuff as many people as they can into each boat. The beaches get crowded with far too many tourists. Hygiene was a huge issue, if you are a family you might as well bring your own snorkeling gear. The beaches",
          "Don't do this. Way to crowded, snorkeling gear and life jackets not properly rinsed (hygiene?). Gasoline damp everywhere. Snorkeling without fish. Dear travel agents stop booking this tour!",
          "We did this trip in 2013 and it was pretty good. Now in 2017 it is a mass race around the sights with \"thousands\" of other boats and tourists. The snorkeling was very poor as our boat insisted that facemasks were snorkels - so unless you are good at holding your breath.....",

          "We traveled there with Mat Bien and it was a complete waste of money. Yes the island is nice but the snorkeling was a waste of time. The gear they provided was disgusting and didn't look as it had ever been cleaned. Of our party 8, 2 people got chronic diarrhea. Not sure if it",
          "It's hard to explain our experience on this island however I need to be honest for those thinking about booking a tour.... It's not paradise it's far from it, the island itself is very polluted and they have some sort of water theme park set up for the locals which was a",

          "Went here on a diving trip, saw some great sights. Lunch was ina bay on the island-- I think the only business was the cafe that served us. Food was fine, beer was cold, the ocean was clear, and the beach was sandy. What more do you need?",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect for Cham Island after doing most of my snorkeling in Thailand but I was pleasantly surprised. There was not an abundance of fish at the snorkeling sites we went to but enough coral to keep us in the water. We visited as part of a snorkeling day",

          "Probably one of the worst experiences my wife and I have had on a tour. The boat ride to the island was on a fast speed boat with very choppy seas. If you have a bad back, don't go. The island itself is not worth the trip, and the snorkelling was interrupted by large jelly fish,",

          "The boat trip was pretty efficient, which first went to a fishing village on Cham Island - one has to ask why, however, except to try and bring in some (much-needed) income onto the island. There is a museum of sorts, possibly the most pointless ever (a few ancient boards/",

          "A bit of a tourist trap, and don't expect a quiet, local experience. After being herded around the tourist circuit consisting of a basic local museum, paddy fields and a small temple you will probably end up on the beach alongside all the other tourists, with no means of escape.",

          "very nice island and super clean water. However the snorkeling isn't anything of extraordinary. It might be recommended to even take your own equipment, since they might be a bit dirty or broken. The food was good, but here as well, you won't get the same stuff as locals do.",
          "We used Blue Coral diving to enjoy a day of snorkelling before heading to the beautiful little Cham island, where we enjoyed lunch and a sunbathe. The team working for Blue Cioral are fantastic, much less egocentric staff than many dive companies. Evreyone had fun and we had a",

          "We were there the last week of March first week of April. The weather was great but unfortunately the water was very cold. Too cold that I even skipped the snorkeling part of the trip. Once docked we decided to take the walking tour of the island. There isn't much to see during",
          "In a nutshell the worst trip I have ever been on. There was no useful information from our guide who hardly spoke any English and no details of the itinerary. The speedboat there and back was unpleasant as the waves were too big for a speedboat. When we got there we went on",
          "the visit included a short tour on the island with an english speaking guide, snorkelling of a boat and seafood lunch. We went as a family, with two children 8 and 10 years old who had never snorkelled before and absolutely loved it. It was a good day!",
          "Went on a day trip with hoiantravel. Picked up from hotel 8am and got back around 2.30. Cost about $25us per person. Reasonable value for snorkeling And swimming on a pristine island. The tour also covered a history of the island nd a seafood lunch.",

          "Would be nice to stay on island for 2 night getaway",
          "The lunch in here is very delicious, we ate grill fish, forest vegtables with speacail fish sauce, sea food.... But scary of the way to go there by cano from Cua Dai beach, it's so dangerous and far away. People in there are very friendly and prevent environment, we appreciate",
          "Came over to Cham Island for a package deal - boat ride across, tour of harbor town, snorkeling and lunch. We paid $21 for this from one of the tour outlets in Hoi An. Overall it was OK for the price. Snorkeling was OK but there was a lot of deal coral and a few fish. As it was",
          "We visited Cu Lao Cham in a sunny day at the end of April and it was really wonderful. We went for a swim at the gorgeous, clear and safe beach. Snorkeling was spectacular. Many thanks go to Minmax Travel. We loved the lunch with delicious seafood they reserved for us fantastic",
          "Another enjoyable half day excursion booked through Hoi An Travel, a 20 min speed boat ride to the island with a short walking tour of the village, rice paddies and one of the temples. Followed by a 3 hour stay on one of the beaches with the option of a short boat trip for 45",
          "Nice beach, another good way to get out of the craziness of Hoi An and relax on the beautiful sandy beach. Snorkling was really average, but was really nice to be in the water! Lunch was fantastic too. Not our favourite part of the trip, but worthwhile if you have a free day!",

          "We expected it to have a little more to see. There is not much in the island apart from the huts that prepare the lunch. After an hour of sitting on the beach we were ready to go and we were stuck there for another 3 hours. There was jellyfish in the water at the time we were",
          "We visited Cham Isaland today and it was really lovely. My little girl had a ball at the beach, gorgeous, clean, safe for swimming. The snorkelling was good, although my one gripe is that the supplied masks and snorkels were awful, leaky, broken. The lunch provided was nice,",
          "Had a lovely morning on the island. Very nice and un spoiled but freezing cold water. Kids only lasted few minutes then had to get out when we stopped for snorkeling off of the island. A bit warmer water when we swam after docking on the island. Had a nice local lunch on the",

          "We took an hour or two to walk across the bridge from Hoi An onto the island. Wide street with mainly locals. At the end of the street we turned right and followed the road around through real local farms and homes. Interesting to see how the people lived. The road curved",
          "I think it is necessary to stay overnight to get the real value from this place. There are a number of establishments. Cham Island Divers is just one. By day the place has swarms of day trippers so it isn't quite so idyllic. You can camp on the beach but bring everything you",
          "Cham Island is definetly worth a look. Not a lot going on there and very basic. Beautiful beach though and a nice day boat trip is available from Hoi An. The reefs are all trashed so snorkelling not great.",

        "wiki": "The H\u1ed9i An Wreck lies 22 miles off the coast of central Vietnam in the South China Sea, at 16.04\u00b0N 108.6\u00b0E\ufeff / 16.04; 108.6 approximately. Discovered by fishermen in the early 1990s, the Vietnamese government made several attempts to organise an investigation of the site but were confounded by the water depth of 230 feet (70 m).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ship was carrying a large cargo of Vietnamese ceramics dated to the mid- to late 15th century. The provenance of the pieces was known to be the kilns of the Red River Delta (such as Chu Dau) because excavations in the region had been ongoing since their discovery in 1983. The only pieces remaining at the kiln sites were faults pieces. Intact examples of the wares produced were rare, since all were exported. When the wreck was found there was excitement among collectors and archaeologists, for it promised the first cargo consisting solely of Vietnamese wares.The wreck was discovered by fishermen around the early 1990s.  For several years the site was intensively plundered resulting in pieces turning up on the market all over the world.  The method employed by the looters was to drag a series of hooks across the site with nets behind the catch to dislodge artefacts.The Vietnamese authorities became aware of the wreck following the arrest of two dealers at Da Nang airport who had in their possession suitcases full of pottery from the site. The wreck was beyond standard diving depth, but something had to be done quickly to prevent further looting.  \nIn 1996, Malaysian-Chinese businessman Ong Soo Hin teamed up with Oxford University archaeologist Mensun Bound to work with Vietnam's National History Museum in excavating the site, with York Archaeological Trust providing conservation services. The project took four years and cost an estimated $US14 million. Over 250,000 intact ceramic artefacts were recovered.\nOver three seasons the team excavated a third of a million pieces of pottery. Most of the pottery was repetitive everyday table ware of little artistic value but there were also items of outstanding artistry.  An \u2018Evaluation Committee\u2019 of leading Vietnamese archaeologists and art historians selected all the unique pieces for the National Collection in Hanoi and then other museums were invited to select what they wished.  Six museums in Vietnam now host permanent exhibitions of material from the wreck. \nThe remaining 90% was sold at auction in 2000 by Butterfields in San Francisco, USA with the Vietnamese Salvage Agency, Saga Horizon and the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture dividing any money made. Part of the proceeds were used to pay for the display, curation and study of the selection that went into the National Collection. The project partners were: Oxford University MARE, Saga Horizon, Vietnam National Salvage Agency (VISAL) and the National History Museum (Hanoi).\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchaeology of shipwrecks\nMaritime archaeology\nList of shipwrecks\nMarine salvage\nWreck diving\nV\u0169ng T\u00e0u shipwreck\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nVietnamese Ceramics from the Hoi An Excavation: The Cu Lao Cham Ship Cargo.

          "Nothing special. It is what it is. Lots of produce. Lots of people. Walk through, then forget. Much better things to do in Hoi An.",
          "There was nothing special about this central market if you have visited similar ones in other city. Since it's the route to access to Hoi An Ancient Town, traffic was very heavy. For this reason, hawker stalls nearing road side would be upset when tourists stood there a bit too",

Where you won\u2019t be hassled, will have better food and is a much better experience as there are more locals.",
          "Feasted in Ms Hoa's food stall (somewhere in the middle) and it was just so tasty. Tried five dishes loved all of them. I don't think it really matters where you eat there as they all seem to offer more or less the same. Highly recommended",

          "The first thing you see as you get into the market are rows and rows of food stalls and keepers trying to convince you to sit down. We went in a few rows before admit defeat and sat down. The food at not expensive and you can try a wide variety without hurting the wallet too",
          "What an experience as the food looked so Fresh and inviting. If I lived here I would be in paradise with fresh fish, vegetables, etc. Great experience to see how they shop, haggle with smiles etc. A real experience which should not be missed.",
          "We have been fortunate to travel in many many parts of the world. It\u2019s always both important and relevant to visit the local markets. This one didn\u2019t disappoint.",
          "At first it\u2019s overwhelming, but persevere because the food is excellent and very well priced. We sampled fresh mango and passion fruit juices for $1 CDN. Lunch was fabulous and authentic. Lots of sights and sounds for all your senses.",

          "I was hoping to get souvenirs from the Central Market but all I saw was food and vegetables. Perhaps my tour guide took us to the wet market side but my boyfriend and I was hoping for souvenirs and gifts to bring home for our loved ones. It was interesting to see the locals in",
          "Very busy and tight market with all you expect to see. The highlight for me is the food court and the Fried Wantons! Not a full on hard sell but they do try hard! A great mix of tourist and local fare.. smells that you hate or love...but an experience worthy of a visit.",
          "This market is more for the locals but amazing to see. Of course, tourists can buy here as well. It is always busy but walking through is a fantastic experience. I would recommend going through it at least once so you can get the idea of how the locals buy their food.",
          "Maybe not the biggest and best market we\u2019ve been to but they always have something to make you smile or make you wonder. The meat areas are always the hardest to wLk through so go around them. Plenty of colourful fruit and veggies being sold by salt of the earth ladies.",
          "Having read other reviews I was a bit concerned that this was just a local food market. There are plenty of souvenirs from wicker work, bamboo, lacquer and crockery to pearls. They do all look fairly similar but the quality is pretty good actually. Lots of lanterns too- the",

          "Extremely smelly and dark inside (we've been in many markets around S.E.Asia and this was far below the usual experience), stallholders sleeping on top of their produce, and harrassment from many along the way, especially outside. Plus,nothing out of the ordinary to want to buy",
          "It's great to get amongst it, shopping with the locals, wandering through the aisles. There are all sorts of goods for sale in this vicinity and the fruit and veg. are of good quality but it's a bit hard to strike a great bargain unless you are Vietnamese or can speak the",

          "Always worth seeing a market. This one, like many in Vietnam is interesting because of all the different types of produce. Colorful, strange ingredients, talkative sellers. A good experience.",
          "There are a large number of vendors selling all kinds of delicious local foods made fresh right in front of you. Similarly, there are drink stalls everywhere selling freshly-made juices and other drinks. You can get well-fed and full with just a few US dollars here, and continue",
          "First experience of Hoi An was this bustling Food & Goods market at night! Plenty of fresh food available and plenty of stalls selling various goods. Reminded me of the Old Phuket Town market in Thailand",
          "Very cheap- about \u00a31 per dish. You can then watch them make it in front of you. Staff next door sells drinks, the lady will come and offer you a drinks menu. Super friendly! We went towards closing (about 7.30pm) so it was much quieter.",
          "Great place to visit. Check out the ladies selling all manner of vegetables , herbs, meat and fish. Then after shopping for all sorts of stuff you think you need but don't really \ud83d\ude06 and start the dance of battering (start at a quarter of asking and go up until you both are",

          "Our trip to Hoi An included a walk-through of the Central Market and a stop at one of the stalls. The meats available here are pork and beef; several of us wondered how often they changed the \"unsanitary\" cardboard that they cut on. We did learn a lot about various spices,",

          "What a eclectic place. Mainly for locals I'd guess, everything fresh you can think of, from fruit, vegetables, fish and everything in between. Interesting that chicken white meat is cheap but the feet, beaks etc not so. Certainly a slice of Vietnam life here.",

          "Surprisingly, I really liked this market, whereas normally I am not that interested in city markets. I think it is because it is a big market relative to the size of Hoi An, but still much smaller than the monster markets you see in large cities. There is a lot of hustle and",

          "A wonderful market. Everything from fresh food to hardware to clothing, you name it. Not like the tourist trap of the \"ancient town\". You'll enjoy the bartering back in forth with the vendors, somewhere between 40 to 50% of the offered price is about right.",

          "The best way to learn about the market is to do a cooking school which includes a tour of the market. The market operates each day and the traders are keen to sell all of their fresh produce of the same day. The fishmongers and butchers make an early start to present their food",
          "After a long day of shopping, we were hungry and headed straight to the market after sunset. The inside of the market was alive and busy with loads of people sitting down to eat at some of the stalls. The food looked good and we were eager to try out some local dishes. After",
          "We saw this market as we approached the town, there were lots of stalls and street food options, we had a quick look around but didn't buy because we had got all we needed. Its worth a scout around to see if there are any bargains that you fancy",
          "This is another one of those markets that expands out to the streets surrounding the rectangular one-story building. You can eat at the small restaurants (we did not attempt to do so due to our sensitive digestive systems) or buy fresh meats, fruits and vegetables. There are",

          "We had our best dessert at this stall - Che Thai Caf\u00e9. So yummy good and each bowl or cup cost 20k-30k dong depending on your toppings. Lady owner spoke English so that we could get what we wanted. Many other stalls sell local food but we did not try. We went further in where",

          "I loved this place - it's packed with food stalls selling very, very cheap (and very, very delicious) Vietnamese food. You can easily try three different dishes and a smoothie for 80,000 dong, and barely be able to walk out the door. I particularly liked Ms. Be Na's food - I'm",

          "A great place to see the local produce and the whole process of buying and selling food without the benefits of refrigeration. In the morning you can get the freshest of the fresh, whether it be meat, seafood, friuit, vegetables or herbs. High energy, active... all you would",
          "The Hoi An Central Market is a typical wet market. It lacks the character of markets in many other places around the region, but is still fun to wander around, especially if you're unaccustomed to Asian open-air markets. It is on the edge of the old city. You'll have trouble",

          "It is definitely worth a walk around but it does contain a lot of tourist stalls that are selling goods available all over the Town. It does, however, have areas more geared towards the locals which we found very interesting. You do have to persevere to get the best out of it",

        "wiki": "H\u1ed9i An (Vietnamese: [h\u00f4j\u02c0 a\u02d0n] (listen)), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nOld Town H\u1ed9i An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its covered \"Japanese Bridge\", dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nH\u1ed9i An (\u6703\u5b89) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town, \u6d77\u5eaf) in Vietnamese.\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang.  Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented.  In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An.In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H\u1ed9i An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\n\nH\u1ed9i An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy\u1ec5n rule (thanks to the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H\u1ed9i An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H\u1ed9i An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 \u00b0C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 \u00b0C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South.  The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C\u00f9 lao Ch\u00e0m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\n\n== Heritage and tourism ==\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H\u1ed9i An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant\u00f3nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l\u1ea7u or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H\u1ed9i An as a major trading port in South East Asia.The Museum of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture\u2014considered to be the original settlers on the H\u1ed9i An site\u2014dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu\u1ef3nh artefacts in Vietnam.The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R\u00e9hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\n\n\n== Food ==\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p\u00e2t\u00e9, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in H\u1ed9i An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show 'No Reservations'. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.The regional dish is Cao l\u1ea7u, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim B\u1ed3ng woodworking village\nH\u1ed9i An wreck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoi An Ancient Town from UNESCO\nHoi An World Heritage - Government website with tourist information.\n Media related to Hoi An at Wikimedia Commons\n Geographic data related to H\u1ed9i An at OpenStreetMap",

We had a relaxing massage at the spa.The only real negative is that the beach across the road was closed due to erosion.",

Besides, you can find a couple of swimming pools.\nHowever, I would like to highlight that they don't have any kind of nursering service. I think it is quite important for such a big hotel.",

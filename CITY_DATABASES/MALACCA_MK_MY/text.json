        "wiki": "A Famosa (Malay: Kota A Famosa; \"The Famous\" in Portuguese) is a former Portuguese fortress located in Malacca, Malaysia. It is among the oldest surviving European architectural remains in Southeast Asia and the Far East. The Porta de Santiago, a small gate house, is the only part of the fortress which still remains today.\nThe name is often mispronounced  Famosa, even among Malaysians, as though the Portuguese definite article a were the English letter A. A more authentic pronunciation would be  Famosa.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1511, a Portuguese fleet arrived under the command of Afonso de Albuquerque. His forces attacked and defeated the armies of the Malacca Sultanate. Moving quickly to consolidate his gains, Albuquerque had the fortress built around a natural hill near the sea. Albuquerque believed that Malacca would become an important port linking Portugal to the Spice Route in China. At this time other Portuguese were establishing outposts in such places as Macau, China and Goa, India to create a string of friendly ports for ships heading to Ming China and returning home to Portugal.\nThe fortress once consisted of long ramparts and four major towers. One was a four-story keep, while the others held an  ammunition storage room, the residence of the captain, and an officers' quarters. Most of the village clustered in town houses inside the fortress walls. As Malacca's population expanded it outgrew the original fort and extensions were added around 1586.\nThe fort changed hands in 1641 when the Dutch drove the Portuguese out of Malacca.  The Dutch renovated the gate in 1670, which explains the logo \"ANNO 1670\" inscribed on the gate's arch. Above the arch is a bas-relief logo of the Dutch East India Company.\nThe fortress changed hands again in the late 18th century when the Dutch handed it over to the British to prevent it from falling into the hands of Napoleon's expansionist France. The English were wary of maintaining the fortification and ordered its destruction in 1806. The fort was almost totally demolished but for the timely intervention of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore, who was sent on sick leave from Penang to Malacca in 1807. It was Captain William Farquhar, tasked with the destruction of the fort and town, who decided to save two of the gateways to the fort, including the Santiago Gate, as well as the Stadthuys, church and jail.\n\n\n== Archaeological finding ==\nIn late November 2006, a structure part of the fort, believed to be the Bastion Middleburg was accidentally uncovered during the construction of 110 meter revolving tower in Malacca Town. The construction of the tower was ceased and its site was subsequently shifted to the popular district of Bandar Hilir on Jalan Merdeka where it was officially opened to the public on 18 April 2008.\nMalacca Museums Corporation suspects the structure was built by the Dutch during the Dutch occupation of Malacca from 1641 to 1824.\nEarlier in June 2004, a watchtower named Santiago Bastion was discovered during the construction of Dataran Pahlawan.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notations ===\nDe Witt, Dennis (2010).

          "I went on my company trip.I should have checked the place before we went.I just trusted my company.Maybe a discount was involved.The place is with the 20 year old architecture.Plus many parts are rusty and with grown grass like near the islamic area.Many areas look abandoned and",
          "I dont even know where to start... We are ashamed we didnt research the place more properly. This place is all about making money and entertainment, animal welfare comes at the last place... All the animal shows seemed to be about entertainment instead of caretaking or education",
          "My family and I rarely got the chance to go for a vacation due to work and schools. Therefore when we finally got the right date, we were panicking choosing the destination because we want the best place to spend time together. Luckily, my sister suggested A Famosa as the final",

          "We bought tickets for both Safari and Waterpark and were given free lunch as part of the package. Having been to Gambang and Singapore zoo safari, we had high expectations since this is a well established place. It turned out to be very disappointing. The trucks used to carry",

          "I really look forward to this trip. But sadly theres abit lacking from past experience. Before there are alot of animal i can watch n feed but this time there only a few numbers. The price is the same(expensive).it also poorly service. The fenced look really old n dangerous.",
          "Animals look sad, mistreated and dehydrated, their habitats are overly dry, sea turtles are in inadequate habitat. Ostriches had lost almost all their feathers. The flamingos were white with faint touches of pink, which indicates inadequate nutrition. The safari took us across a",
          "I won\u2019t recommend those who are staying in Melaka or further away to intentionally drive to this zoo. It isn\u2019t worth the effort, time and money. However, if you are already staying at A\u2019Famosa then you can consider visiting this place. As indicated in the rating, this is just",
          "although it was an okay day trip (despite entry cost being pricey), i was concerned that many of the animals seemed to be looked after badly. one of the most appalling things we noticed was the riding area. there were two elephants that were kept in a small area waiting for",

          "A zoo that offers alot off interactions with the animals. Children will enjoy this zoo because there are lots of feeding opportunities. We fed the tiger, something that is a rare experience. We fed rabbits, ducks, goose, emu, pocupines, ponies too. The ride was interesting where",

          "I had a random trip here but it was worth the visit. The place is quite large and you get to see different type of animals here. There are some interesting shows. The cowboy one was quite a bore imo, probably because they got some problems with the mic that it's hard to hear",
          "Different experience from a zoo as the animals are not caged. In addition u get to enjoy a short boat ride and experience seeing \"wild\" animals inside a caged truck. You get to feed the monkeys too. Kids will find it a good experience. Animal shows are ok. However don't expect",
          "If you decided to go to Safari Wonderland at the last minute, always check for online deals in tickets apps/website (like Fave app) because the price at the counter is 34% higher than the price you buy online. Normal price for the tickets at the counter is RM69, while online",
          "1) u can experience direct contact with most of the animal inside. There is a large crowd of hans that u can handpick and pet. There is also little baby duck and rabbit that u can feed. Very nice experience. 2) there is lunch included and its delicious meals that u can choose",

          "Visited on a random by pass and wow. Booked with our tour guide and got a good deal including food and feeding tigers. Yes it is run down but it is not Disney world. It is more cultural and rustic and makes it even better. Monkey island was great. Go over there as soon as and",
          "Ticket price is a bit pricey if you buy over the counter. Slightly run down and unmaintained. Animal experience wise is just average. Lunch is part of the entrance ticket price, which by all means if possible skip it.",
          "about 1 hour / 1 hour 30 mins away from KL. the place is a bit run down but the variety of animals available to see is decent. you get to feed a tiger through a cage which is interesting and you get to travel to a island with strictly monkeys on it but we didn't see any monkeys!",
          "You will definitely see some interesting stuff. Kids will surely love it. Particularly the part where you go to see the tigers and feed them. (Feeding is extra, make sure you specify it when buying your ticket). Elephant show is a good one. You can even ride them for extra",
          "Almost un-maintained. The place could be better manage since we saw numbers of visitors are many. The lunch was on package and it was just standard package. some of the animals are dying. The saver of the day was truck tour that was informative and interesting - the lion and",

          "A Small ZOO including Safari but very engaging and informative. 3 Very good animal shows. Safari in a caged truck is also very good experience. Although not very big but traveling through animals in truck was fun. Best were tiger feeding and monkey island experience. If you",
          "The only thing that save the whole trip was the buffet lunch. The spread was normal but really worth the money. The truck trip was not good as the driver stopped at wrong spot a few times. It was hot too. Think the management can install fans. Same with the wild wild west show.",
          "A Great Experience for your young Kids, even for you it's going to be a unique place to have a special outing with your dearest. Be planned for a full day and I mean it , from 10 am until 11 pm. Great Animals display, shows , resort and a grand finale with fireworks at night.",

          "Beside deer, sheep, cattle, peacock, rest of the animals were limited in quantity. Lion and tiger looks not healthy. Even the elephants were thin. It was great for children to play with the animals. I hope they can do something about the trucks - there are old gasoline operated",
          "I brought along children age 3 & 7. Both of them had fun at this safari. I went during the non peak season. Therefore it was short queue and we could feel more relaxing too. The truck ride into the safari park was about 20 minutes. They made one stop, which was the bear",
          "As part of our group tour, we went to A'Fammosa park where we went into the Animal Safari Park and also the water park as well. It is nice place to enjoy for whole day with place to have lunch in. Recommended for families with kids whose will enjoy the Animal Safari Park. Enjoy",

          "To make it short; don't go there unless you don't have anything else to do. Over priced, not clean, and dirty restaurants \"I have seen a rat!!\" You have to pay for lunch,, even if you don't want to. Overall, it was below average experience.",

          "WORST.ZOO.EVER. Can only consider as small animal farm. We only saw 2 lions and 4 tigers that are not active at all. No leopard or some other animals. We use only one hour to finish everything. Animals are so skinny and dirty, I wonder that they feed the animals and clean them",

          "Been there for a day and found the safari to be a disappointment. Queue was long and inefficient as only one counter is opened. No doubt they have got another assistant to take your booking,however, Malaysian identity card must be shown to the counter. At RM 54 per ticket.",
          "After our first experience here, there really isn't a point to return for second helping. Its basically a mini zoo with a safari ride included. The zoo on its own was dirty, smelly & not well maintained. You also get a sense that the animals are not given the proper treatment",
          "Have been here many times as children love to get close to the animals. The quality has somehow dropped as the place is not maintained to the optimum level. Started out as a very good place and concept. Hope the management does something to keep it as an attraction worth a",

          "If you've got too much money, do not even bother contributing to this pathetic place because its certainly a waste of time too!!! The entrance fees are not cheap for a visit too - costing more than RM 40!!! The animals were starving and we were to fork out RM5 for 5 long",
          "A very small scale safari , u can cover the grounds in less than an hr Highlight was the tiger feeding , which was a up close encounter separate only by a fence ( extras fees required) . A visit to the monkey island is a must too . the monkeys will be jumping on you in hoping",

          "Another thing that must try if you in Malacca although there is nothing spectacular when we are at the top. What interest me is the Chendol stall below.",
          "It is my 2nd time to be on this tower and it is quite exciting to see from the top. The entrance fee is average, not cheap but, the view is spectacular. Even for a person who is afraid of heights, the travelling speed up and down is slow and gentle. We visited this during the",
          "To those who hate highness, i don't recommended this type of activities. The tower is quite high but love the view and information given during the entrance reach to the top and slowly come down.",
          "Very nice view of Melaka City. Good location with ample parking. close to dataran pahlawan, Just dont forget to put the parking ticket or you will be fined.",
          "We got there after a significant detour caused by the Trip Advisor location for this being about 1km further along the road than it actually was. It\u2019s very close to the big ship museum. Doesn\u2019t take long to go up and down but it\u2019s location lets you see all the key sites from",
          "We could see this rotating viewing platform from out hotel and so decided when we were close enough have a go. We quickly bought our tickets and boarded and then waited about 5 minutes for the platform to raise the 80 feet to the top where I think it stayed for about 10",
          "Worth the experience. Great way to see 360 view of the city. Short trip and down. There is a guide on the tour that provides some information about the various landmarks. Better to go during the day if you want to see the view.",
          "Those who love to see from height this is for them. A bird eye view of the city and surroundings captivate you as you rise up.",
          "Worth the visit up to get an unobstructed aerial view of the Malacca Strait and perhaps even see Sumatra in the distance if it is a super clear day. Goes up every 20 or 30 minutes so just arrive when you do and wait it out if you aren't lucky. Nearby the maritime museum (inside",
          "This is best way to get your bearings in Melaka. I cat remember what the cost was but It would not have been more than $15 (australian) per person. Queues have never been to long and they give you a complimentary bottle of water at the ticket box. There is the obligatory photo",
          "You'll get an amazing view. Not for those who are scared of heights!!! Otherwise it is an awesome way of seeing the city, the sea and the hinterland. Wonderful!",
          "Great experience for my family who is actually scared of height.. Nice views around.. Full blast aircon in there..",
          "The whole experience was over priced for just 5 minutes. I personally preferred the morning views, where you can see the water. The lights in the city at night aren't spectacular. There are discounted rates for Malaysian citizens and senior people. There are binoculars for hire,",
          "Initially I wasn't sure how it might turn out to be but a look from below eased that feeling. Again I preferred the night time instead of morning since Melaka is very hot and humid and sunny sunny sunny during the day. On a cloudy day it would be different. But if it's too",
          "a few minutes of view ......around Melaka..... could see the straits, development, reclaimed land and other attractions as well...",
          "This slowly revolving tower reaches 80 meters high giving great views of Melacca. Inexpensive rates for Senior Citizens. Well worth the slight wait",
          "There are plenty of activities to do in this vicinity. It also have a premium outlet nearby if you are caught under the hot sun. But there's this durian chendol store there called \"Musang King\" which is worth the visit.",
          "Took a chance to watch the sky view of Malacca. Shouldn't be missed when in Malacca. The tix is also cheap for this kinda experience. Malacca is indeed an interesting place. Would come again in future.",
          "This is a observation tower in the middle of Malacca city having jonker street at one side and sea on the other. Ride is for about 5 mins. There is one recreational park right next to it having few rides like bumper car, etc. Ticket was not that costly. You can park your car",
          "Its place in the middle of town and easy to get. To see the sights of the entire city of Malacca we can ride the rides they provide by paying 23 MYR per person. Many people are selling souvenirs here. Must try and definitely like.",
          "The ride costs 22 MYR (about 5usd), and only lasts a few minutes. However, if you go at the right time, you won't have to wait in line. I was there at around 5pm and there were only 4 other people on the ride (it seats 66). They give you a bottle of water before you enter.",
          "Expensive but worth. The highest point to see view of malaka. The deck turns around 360\u2019. Nice viewing, but short time.",
          "Great experience sitting on a air conditioned revolving tower!! Fabulous view from top at night & enjoying panoramic view of wonderful Melaka",
          "The price is reasonable to get on this sky tower. It rotates 360 degrees for about 30 minutes. You can sit during the ride. It\u2019s recommended to ride this sky tower at night as the lights are so beautiful you don\u2019t wanna miss it. They even offer a bottle of water when you buy",
          "Get a 360 degree of Malacca from on high. Circular observation deck with everyone seated rises on a column while rotating so everyone gets a great view of Malacca and the Straits of Malacca. Wonderful views.",
          "Think of a revolving restaurant minus restaurant. There are seats all around the levitating floor (can I call it that?) which then becomes a revolving floor when it reaches the top. About 4 revolutions (I wasn't counting) sufficient to capture Melaka city 360. And down we came.",
          "One of the highlights of Malacca. View at each level, as you slowly go up, is better than the previous one until you reach amazing 360 degree views of the town, river and the straits. A bit expensive but worth trying out. It's slow so you won't feel dizzy, although the wait to",
          "Reasonable prize to pay to go up. Able to see the full view of Malacca. Prefer to go at night so can see the night view of the city.",
          "It\u2019s another tower where u pay and enter for the view of the city. Only this one takes you in a kind of roller coaster type trip up. The viewing gallery revolves from the floor of the tower going up whereby you get the 360 degree view of the city without having to move from your",
          "When you can explore the whole city within 7 minutes from 300 meters above, why not? Quite breath taking, if you're not afraid of heights...",
          "This is a great idea, its something different to do. It's air conditioned and you get to see 360 degree views of Melaka. You step into it on ground level and sit on a seat with floor to ceiling glass windows then it slowly rotates up to the top. Reasonable price as well.",
          "The place was great...parking space was near...used coupen to park...have new interactive like mini ride 3D... VR ride games...it was great...have to try..",

          "*must go,see and explore* the best part to see n view the entire town.u must go n visit menara taming sari..the best time between 6pm to 7pm .u may see the sunset moment.it was awesome and beautiful. RM 17 for Malaysian and RM 21 for non Malaysian. Even just 7 minute on the top",
          "Actually nothing much to see at higher heights cos Melaka does not have interesting or spectacular skyline. It is basically a small town with low-rise buildings that should be explored by walking.",
          "This is a great tourist spot. It is air conditioning and provides an amazing 360deg view of Melaka. We went up during the afternoon although I think it would be spectacular at night. The whole room spins slowly around the tower giving visitors an uninterrupted view of the area.",
          "From distance, nothing attracts me when I look at this tower. Then I get closer to it and found there is revolving carrying about 80 people up to the top and it lasted for 7 minutes only. It's worth trying as first time being on board, but I definitely won't do it again since",
          "This gives an incredible view of Melaka and one you won't get anywhere else. Entry fee also included a bottle of water.",
          "- 360\u00b0 panoramic view of Malacca city n Straits of Malacca - very cool structure\u2019s design - quite expensive for such short ride - may experienced slight acrophobia compared to KL Tower - advisable to take the ride during clear day for better view or during sunset or at night",
          "Entrance fees were RM17 for adults. It is about 10 minutes and it slowly revolves. Amazing views of the city. We were up there were a thunderstorm was brewing and we could see the dark clouds with lightning. Amazing experience.",
          "It\u2019s better to visit the tower when it\u2019s completely dark at night - which contributes to a better view.",
          "It is all nearby the Heritage sites & nice to go up & get a view of the Malacca Straits. It was too quick coming down. The tickets were RM 59 for 3 foreign adults. They charge different rates for tourists in Malaysia & hotels also have tourists taxes of 10% +6%+ Heritage tax in",
          "Not much to say about this attraction to be totally honest. You go up and get a brilliant view all round of Melaka and as far as the eye can see. I enjoyed it.",
          "-its so high -im afraid of height , its quite scary but it was cool -we went there at night, love to see the lights in Malacca -price rm17/rm18 for adult, quite pricey. you would get a 500 ml mineral too -they would take your photo before you get lifted towards the sky ,",
          "This place gives a very good 360 degree view of the city. takes about 10-15 minutes for the entire trip.",
          "Going up in a turning around cabine you have great views over Malacca. At one side the hill with St Peters and Formosa fort. At the other side the harbour with the old ship with a museum inside",
          "Had my family visit this amazing Menara Taming Sari. We enjoyed looking Malacca on the air it was breathtaking and splendid view. It is well organized and clean. We also tried the Duck truck!",

          "We have to buy a ticket to enter the tower. It cost us RM17 for adult and RM13 for child. It takes about 10min for whole activities. It will stop at the highest about 7mins but keep turning round for us to see the whole city of Melaka.",
          "Got to witness nice views of the whole city of Malacca on this tower ride. A short ride going up and going around slowly viewing the whole city. Nice thing to do once!",
          "Beautiful views, not enough time in the viewing tower. Great a.c. and comfirtsblevchairs as you swirl slowly around.",
          "I would recommend to visit this close to sunset. The ride up is quite interesting as it does a slow turn to the top. The view from the top of the city is beautiful and you will get about 3 full turns before coming back down. You spend about 15 mins at the top. For price",
          "The tower goes up and offers best view of Melaka in 360 degrees.The ticket price is approx. 17 per adult..",
          "frankly speaking this one is only worth it for experience. the entrance fee was a bit expensive for less than 10 mins ride from bottom up and go down. it did not stop at the top for picture, so if u wanna have picture you better take it while its going up or down (as many as you",

          "Our family of 6 decided to check out this revolving tower - gyro style. You can find such tower in theme park. Not much crowd, we get to go in quite fast. The tower is clean and air conditioned. There are seats for everyone. Once up there, you get to see the whole of Malacca",

          "The entire duration of the view is about 5 minutes, starting from ground level. It will rotate twice at the top, and will start to go down but will keep on rotating. It would be great if the commentator is audible, I could barely understand what they were saying, I'm assuming is",
          "Taming sari is an obzervation tower at Melacca i.e. Melaka Malaysia. Its obzervation platform will move up in vertical from ground level to the top of the tower and spin slowly in 360 for a city views. you need to pay for an entrance fees. the place located within walking",
          "First time here. Ride was definitely fun. Can see the surrounding area of melaka. Hopefully scenery will improve because there was a lot of development going on so it spoilts the view. Should lower the price to attract more visitors.",

          "Good for people who love 360-view of Malacca. About 7 min view of Malacca. Got a water as compliment for visitor. If you like a photo they took its about twenty ringgit each. I saw binocular return point when landing but didn't see where to borrow.",
          "It is possibly not that interesting to see because you can't see some part of the touristy places such as Christ Church or the Red Square. But you get to see most of the Melaka town and Straits of Melaka. Is it really worth the ride? When you have kids, yes. For them, it is",

          "Stunning 360 degree views of Melaka from this revolving platform. The only draw back was the wait as the staff need a certain number before the platform operates. Prices were reasonable. If you are over 55 you can even get a discount and a free bottle of water!",
          "I went here with my 15 year old sister and it wasn't really breath taking or mind-numbing to us. Probably, because we live here. But, it was a nice experience. For someone that knows every alley and junction in Melaka, I saw how it all looked combined from way up in the Taming",

          "There is a separate payment for locals and foreigners. A short trip up, rotates a couple of times and heads down. Enough time to see the 360view. Naturally day view gives a far reaching panorama. Night view and you enjoy the lights. Worth the visit once.",
          "I visited Melaka with a good friend to celebrate our birthdays. We're both scared of heights and thought we should give Taming Sari a try just for the thrill. It was worth it. Going up was the best as you can see the cars and everything on the ground starts to get smaller. After",

          "The ticket is quite expensive. Location strategic but quite challenging to get parking. Worst was to buy parking ticket.",
          "It's rather short period up there. Not suitable for who's afraid of height as the area inside the tower is rather small, so might feel a bit scary for some. But since the ride is rather short, worth a try. The view up there is rather nice too.",

          "Excellent view of Malacca. Preferably I would go during the day as you tend to see more and maybe have an idea where to head to next. Not advisable to go during the weekends as the area itself is pretty jam packed with people and rickshaws, but if you were going to have a go on",

          "It cost quite cheap to actually head up there. The view is nice and a good spot to take panorama shot as it spins around at a steady pace. It's also aircon and they do provide you with a bottle of mineral water as a small perk. Pictures can be bought after the ride for a small",
          "Located 10min walking from the Red Square, the menara was air-conditioned. Ticket counter was located inside the building at the base and the queue lines are located outside at the base of the menara. It was quite expensive at RM$23 per adult in my opinion. Unless you have",
          "I felt this amusement was quite necessary when I first came to town. It offers a perfect perspective of the layout of the old town. They supply a bottle of water and it is air conditioned. As it rotates you see exactly what might interest you during your stay. You don't see",

          "We took our kids to this ride. It will spin as it goes up to give you a 360 degree view of Melaka. It will stay on the top for a few minutes then come spinning down. Definitely worth the $7-8 per ride.",
          "We went during the mid afternoon. Not too much of a queue. Lovely view of entire Malacca. Good picture opportunities. I would believe the night ride would be better with all the pretty lights.",

          "A good place to view Melaka from the top. You can get to see a different side of Melaka, comparing with the view at Penang Hill. However, maybe the glass needs to be cleaned from time to time.",
          "The ride is just for 7 mins and its just like a view from 20th floor of your hotel. Nothing great. The staff was so rude to us. She asked us to buy ticket for 1 year 10 months baby saying he is 2. I told that we don't buy tickets even on flights but who cares. She never",

          "One of the much hyped tourist attraction spot in Melaka. Having failed to visit this place before, I decided not to miss this time around. Menara Taming Sari (revolving gyro tower) is located in the heart of Melaka and parking can be a challenge during the peak season. The ride",
          "Taming Sari is a tower that will goes up and circling the pole for a 360 degrees view of Malacca for approximately 7 minutes. It's best if you visit this tower round the sunset, where the sky will really catch your breath away (ps: of course, if the sky is clear), anyway though",

          "40RM for 2 Adult Foreigners (cheaper for locals...and it was well worth the $14AUD. Great views of the city, and helps give a perspective on the development, logistics and area of Melaka. Probably all up 12 minutes start to finish...but, part of the Tourism caper. Worth the",
          "A place worth visiting. You might need to wait for your turn but it is worth waiting in queue to have that spectacular view of the melaka city. It is just wow experience when the tower rotates.",
          "I have been to this ride twice ....once during the day and then during the night. I and the family enjoyed it throughly. Its a very short ride ( approx 10 minutes) and even for people who fear heights, this is not too bad. The views are excellent so keep your cameras ready.",

          "Melaka is a blend of history and modernity, where architecture from sultanate, portugese, british and malay eras jostle for your view with the high rise and modern buildings. One place from where you can see all, and see all of them blending beautifully is Menara Taming Sari,",

          "Was nice to be in this revolving tower to see the entire malacca. The ride is smooth and cosy and binoculars are provided for those who want to see further. Great to be at especially during evening sunset. Would be better if there is commentaries provided.",
          "The revolving tower turns slightly faster than the other revolving towers I have been. There are 2 ticket pricing, one for locals and one for foreigners. Surprisingly, there was a queue before it opens at 10am and on a Saturday morning. Although it is only about 80m high, it",
          "Just sit back and enjoy this slow ride. It gives you a 360 degree view of the whole city. Can visit if you got an hour at your hand!",
          "A short, and not inexpensive trip. As the tower revolves, the views are great. Can see all over Melaka. Seats mean accessible to anyone. Pleased we took this trip.",

          "Nice attraction to reach riding on the back seat of a tricycle driven by the locals for a reasonable fare but nothing special about it in fact. Nice view from above of the river and old buildings but not that spectacular after all. We were offered a bottle of mineral water and a",
          "I feel it is better to go there at night with all colourful lights in Melaka. Good trip, thanks for giving some titbits, but I think it could be more meaningful trip if there are instructors who can tell what interesting places can be seen from above during the trip.",
          "Excellent views around town. You sit in aircon and it revolves around as it goes up. Really a good attraction, well worth doing",
          "It was amazing to see Melaka from heights.....not only the city but you can also see the ocean ..... recommended if you're not afraid of height :)",
          "The view was good but a short one. Binoculars was provided and my kids were exploring on using them. The ticket included a bottle of mineral water and some kind of cookies. No harm trying if you're bored with all the walking and have a good view of the surroundings.",

          "The ride is for 10min and you pay around rm 50 pp. The view is nice but found it average. Ppl say the view is good during night time. We found the staff issuing tickets very lost as they were unaware about their own.promotion schemes. When we pointed that out , they gave us the",
          "View from top is nice, but I was hoping the ride will last at least 30 min. But it was over in about 10 mins. Entry fee is about 20 MYR, gets you a bottle of water and light snacks. Do try when in Melaka",
          "Menara Taming Sari towers over the city and literally hums so loudly you can hear it in the distance. Nothing special to see as it pushes upward and circles you around for a 360 view. Save your ringgit for a nice meal.",
          "Its quite nice for people who want to see the whole of Malacca. And just that. Could be better though.",
          "This rotating tower offer stunning view of Malacca. I will recommended to everyone that come to Mallaca, to visit here. The ticket price is different for local and tourist, but surely still affordable. This tower also operated at night and there are lot of monument, museum,",

          "Going up to find out the visual of malaca on the top of taming sari tower. We love to look malaca on night. From the 80m high we can enjoy the malaca landscape on night. It was a beatiful night city panorama. For tourist it takes about MYR 20.",
          "The Menara Taming Sari was an excellent attraction which offered spectacular views of the Malacca City. You get to see the bird's eye view of the organization of Malacca and then appreciate the city as a whole.",
          "The views and scenery are indeed beautiful, but something that pissed off is the occupancy of parking lot. Previously, I went at night. And guess what the parking lot is fully occupied by the trishaw. This has created a big inconvenience to me, since I am driving. Note to the",
          "Melaka is a beautiful city...and view from Menara tower is awesome...we enjoyed a lot...we are able to view great view of heritage city...really recommend this to all travellers",
          "The views from up here are quite good but not much better than from St. Paul's Hill which is free. The tower for us wasn't worth the money and the queuing. Not good for anyone who doesn't like heights either.",
          "Worth it just for the views, you get to see the whole of Melaka in a very different light, short but sweet!!!",
          "As it was Chinese new year, I had to wait for an hour to be on the rotating platform. The view is great! The staff was explaining something in Malay and English but was not understandable as the speakers were of low quality.. It was a short ride but worthwhile..",
          "Pros: -You will have a bird's eye view of the city -Not bad for an Admission Fee of MYR20 for a 20-minute ride. Cons: Audio guide is more of a nuisance. Your eyes will be delighted but your ears won't.",

          "One of the lousiet attraction in malacca. No idea why anyone would recommend going to this attraction. The view is not really good and its only for less than 20minutes. Definitely not worth going up in it for the price you're paying.",
          "Helps you get a full view of Melaka city. It is sometimes crowded but you can enjoy a local back massage in your waiting time. Well maintained ride",
          "This part of an attraction is a must try if you want to have a nice 360 view of Malacca from upper view. Been here with few of my friends, its much better during night. But, if u have a fear of height better reconsider it.",
          "stunning view of world heritage city of Malacca such St.Paul hill, flor de la mar, dataran pahlawan and the straits of Malacca. The tower height is 110 meters and passenger capacity is about 66 people. The fee is RM20 for adults, while children under 12 years is RM10 per person.",
          "A must try attraction to anyone visiting Malacca. Something different. Pricing is reasonable if you have a MyKad. Awesome view of the city at night. I managed to get a few great shots using my DSLR. The tickets even comes with complimentary mineral water and some snacks. The",

          "A good 360 view of Malacca , though the trip was rather short, a breathtaking view of historical Malacca in the rotating tower is worth taking",

          "Must do when in malacca!!!! Offers a 360 degree view of the city while u sit peacefully in an AC chamber.(can be a bliss with the hot malacca weather outside) Also they provide binoculars for better vision of the sites of interest. Is a very slow n safe ride no need to panic for",
          "The money, the line, the waiting, all that for what? Just a couple minutes going up and down. That is totally not worth it. I would definitely waste my money and my time on something else. The line goes crazy, like you have to wait for 1-2 hour just to get on this thing, it's",
          "I would personally suggest this place to be the 1st site to stop by for anyone who visits Melacca as it enables the tourists to get a rough view of the whole Melacca city in 360 degrees before proceeding to the inner part of the city.",
          "If you like to get to the heights to see the lay of a new city, this is a great and fun way to orient yourself.",
          "I don't know why this tower is for? It serves no purpose & have no significant to the history of Malacca!!! I just don't understand how UNESCO can approve this??? I think just because K.L. has a KL Tower so the state government must also have one? The money spent on this tower",
          "It was amazing to see the lights of Malacca at night. Great experience. Enjoyed it very much. The entire trip was within 15 minutes and I felt it was too short. It would have been great if it's at least 30 minutes for the entire going up and going down journey. More time to",

          "Its an expensive ride. You get a view of the city, but for a limited amount of time. Might be good for families, but there are better things to spend on.",
          "Worth the price. A good bird eye view at the top for about 5mins. There are chairs for visitors to sit inside too.",
          "It gives a 360-degree view of Melaka from a height of 100 metres, complete with binoculars provided on board. The queues can be long during peak season. It makes sense to buy the tickets a couple hours in advance and come back when the queue is shorter. The authorities might",
          "Wonderful! Great view to see Melaka from the Above. Good n suitable for All Ages. One thing for Sure - KIDS WILL LOVE IT!! I would suggest to stay at hotels nearby ( lots of it ). All attractions are within reach. Reccomended to stay 2/3 days to venture all attractions nearby.",
          "COST: RM25 per person (adult). We found it amusing that you get a free mineral water and a packet of kueh bahulu along with the ticket. The kueh bahulus were nothing to rave about though. RIDE: There are binoculars for every passenger. The ride turns as it moves up, so you can",

          "It's good to see all city. And many people can ride it together, so don't need to wait for long time. But i don't think price is reasonable. As i think, it's a little bit expensive.... Anyway it would be good experience, but only one time is enough.",
          "This \"gyro\" viewing platform rises up the column and rotates at the same time, so you get a constantly changing view of Malacca and its surroundings during the ride. You need a clear day to appreciate it. Low price - only 20 RM which is a fraction of what you pay at similar",

        "wiki": "The Malacca Sultanate (Malay: Kesultanan Melayu Melaka; Jawi script: \u06a9\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0648 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u06a9) was a Malay sultanate centred in the modern-day state of Malacca, Malaysia. Conventional historical thesis marks c. 1400 as the founding year of the sultanate by a Malay Raja of Singapura (King of Singapore), Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah. \nAt the height of the sultanate's power in the 15th century, its capital grew into one of the most important entrep\u00f4ts of its time, with territory covering much of the Malay Peninsula, the Riau Islands and a significant portion of the northern coast of Sumatra in present-day Indonesia.As a bustling international trading port, Malacca emerged as a centre for Islamic learning and dissemination, and encouraged the development of the Malay language, literature and arts. It heralded the golden age of Malay sultanates in the archipelago, in which Classical Malay became the lingua franca of the Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary medium for cultural, religious and intellectual exchange. It is through these intellectual, spiritual and cultural developments, the Malaccan era witnessed the enculturation of a Malay identity, the Malayisation of the region and the subsequent formation of an Alam Melayu.In the year of 1511, the capital of Malacca fell to the Portuguese Empire, forcing the last Sultan, Mahmud Shah (r. 1488\u20131511), to retreat to the further reaches of his empire, where his progeny established new ruling dynasties, Johor and Perak. The political and cultural legacy of the sultanate remains to this day. For centuries, Malacca has been held up as an exemplar of Malay-Muslim civilisation. It established systems of trade, diplomacy, and governance that persisted well into the 19th century, and introduced concepts such as daulat \u2013 a distinctly Malay notion of sovereignty \u2013 that continues to shape contemporary understanding of Malay kingship. The fall of Malacca benefited Brunei when its ports became a new entrep\u00f4t as the kingdom emerged as a new Muslim empire in the Malay Archipelago, attracting many Muslim traders who fled from the Portuguese occupation after the ruler of Brunei's conversion to Islam.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early foundation ===\nThe series of raids launched by the Chola Empire in the 11th century had weakened the once glorious empire of Srivijaya. By the end of the 13th century, the already fragmented Srivijaya caught the attention of the expansionist Javanese King, Kertanegara of Singhasari. In 1275, he decreed the Pamalayu expedition to overrun Sumatra. By 1288, Singhasari naval expeditionary forces successfully sacked Jambi and Palembang and brought Malayu Dharmasraya\u2014the successor state of Srivijaya, to its knees. In 1293 Singhasari was succeeded by Majapahit ruling the region.\nAccording to the Malay Annals, a prince from Palembang named Seri Teri Buana who claimed to be a descendant of Alexander the Great, stayed in the island of Bintan for several years before he set sail and landed on Temasek in 1299. The Orang Laut (Sea People), famous for their loyal services to Srivijaya, eventually made him king of a new kingdom called Singapura. In the 14th century, Singapura developed concurrently with the Pax Mongolica era and rose from a small trading outpost into a centre of international trade with strong ties with the Yuan Dynasty.\nIn an effort to revive the fortune of Malayu in Sumatra, in the 1370s, a Malay ruler of Palembang sent an envoy to the court of the first emperor of the newly established Ming dynasty. He invited China to resume the tributary system, just like Srivijaya did several centuries earlier. Learning this diplomatic maneuver, immediately King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit sent an envoy to Nanking, convinced the emperor that Malayu was their vassal, and was not an independent country. Subsequently, in 1377\u2014a few years after the death of Gajah Mada, Majapahit sent a punitive naval attack against a rebellion in Palembang, which caused the complete destruction of Srivijaya and caused the diaspora of the Srivijayan princes and nobles. Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation.\nBy the second half of 14th century, Kingdom of Singapura grew wealthy. However, its success alarmed two regional powers at that time, Ayuthaya from the north and Majapahit from the south. As a result, the kingdom's fortified capital was attacked by at least two major foreign invasions before it was finally sacked by Majapahit in 1398. The fifth and last king, Parameswara fled to the west coast of the Malay Peninsula.\nParameswara (also known as \"Iskandar Shah\" in some accounts) fled north to Muar, Ujong Tanah and Biawak Busuk before reaching a fishing village at the mouth of Bertam river (modern-day Malacca River). The village belonged to the sea-sakai or orang laut which were left alone by Majapahit forces that not only sacked Singapura but also Langkasuka and Pasai. As a result, the village became a safe haven and in the 1370s it began to receive a growing number of refugees running away from Mahapahit's attacks. By the time Parameswara reached Malacca in the early 1400s, the place already had a cosmopolitan feel with Buddhists from the north, Hindus from Palembang and Muslims from Pasai.Legend has it that Parameswara saw a mouse deer outwit his hunting dog into the water when he was resting under the Malacca tree. He thought this bode well, remarking, 'this place is excellent, even the mouse deer is formidable; it is best that we establish a kingdom here'. Tradition holds that he named the settlement after the tree he was leaning against while witnessing the portentous event. Today, the mouse deer is part of modern Malacca's coat of arms. The name \"Malacca\" itself was derived from the fruit-bearing Melaka tree (Malay: Pokok Melaka) scientifically termed as Phyllanthus emblica. Another account of the naming origin of Malacca elaborates that during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (r. 1424\u20131444), the Arab merchants called the kingdom 'Malakat' (Arabic for 'congregation of merchants') because it was home to many trading communities.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\n\nFollowing  establishment of his new city in Malacca, Parameswara initiated the development of the place and laid the foundation of a trade port. The indigenous inhabitants of the straits, the Orang Laut, were employed to patrol the adjacent sea areas, to repel other petty pirates, and to direct traders to Malacca. Within years, news about Malacca becoming a centre of trade and commerce began to spread all over the eastern part of the world. In 1405, Yongle Emperor of Ming Dynasty (r. 1402\u20131424) sent his envoy headed by Yin Qing to Malacca. Yin Qing's visit opened the way for the establishment of friendly relations between Malacca and China. Two years later, the legendary Admiral Zheng He made his first of six visits to Malacca. Chinese merchants began calling at the port and pioneering foreign trading bases in Malacca. Other foreign traders notably the Arabs, Indians, and Persians came to establish their trading bases and settle in Malacca, soaring its population to 2000. In 1411, Parameswara headed a royal party of 540 people and left for China with Admiral Zheng He to visit the Ming court.  In 1414, the Ming Shilu mentions that the son of the first ruler of Malacca visited Ming court to inform Yongle that his father had died.During the reign of Parameswara's son, Megat Iskandar Shah (r. 1414\u20131424), the kingdom continued to prosper. The period saw the diversification of economic sources of the kingdom with the discovery of two tin mining areas in the northern part of the city, sago palms in the orchards and nipah palms lining in the estuaries and beaches. To improve the defence mechanism of the city from potential aggressors, Megat Iskandar Shah ordered the construction of a wall surrounding the city with four guarded entrances. A fenced fortress was also built in the town centre where the state's treasury and supply were stored. The growth of Malacca coincided with the rising power of Ayuthaya in the north. The growing ambitions of the kingdom against its neighbours and Malay Peninsula had alarmed the ruler of Malacca. In a preemptive measure, the king headed a royal visit to China in 1418 to raise his concerns about the threat. Yongle responded in October 1419 by sending his envoy to warn the Siamese ruler. Relationship between the China and Malacca were further strengthened by several envoys to China, led by the Malaccan princes in the years 1420, 1421 and 1423. Due to this, it can be said that Malacca was economically and diplomatically fortified.\nBetween 1424 and 1433, two more royal visits to China were made during the reign of the third ruler, Raja Tengah (r. 1424\u20131444). During Raja Tengah's rule, it was said that an ulama called Saiyid Abdul Aziz came to Malacca to spread the teaching of Islam. The king together with his royal family, senior officials and the subjects of Malacca listened to his teachings. Shortly after, Raja Tengah adopted the Muslim name, Muhammad Shah and the title Sultan on the advice of the ulama. He introduced the Islamisation in his administration \u2013 customs, royal protocols, bureaucracy and commerce were made to conform to the principles of Islam. As Malacca became increasingly important as an international trading centre, the equitable regulation of trade was the key to continued prosperity \u2013 and the Undang-Undang Laut Melaka ('Maritime Laws of Malacca'), promulgated during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah, was an important facet of this. So too was the appointment of four Shahbandars for the different communities of the port. This accommodated foreign traders, who were also assigned their own enclaves in the city. In 1430s, China had reversed its policy of maritime expansion. However, by then Malacca was strong enough militarily to defend itself. In spite of these developments, China maintained a continuous show of friendship, suggesting that it placed Malacca in high regard. In fact, although it was China's practice to consider most foreign countries as vassal states, including Italy and Portugal, its relations with Malacca were characterised by mutual respect and friendship, such as that between two sovereign countries.In 1444, Muhammad Shah died after reigning for twenty years and left behind two sons; Raja Kasim, the son of Tun Wati who in turn a daughter of a wealthy Indian merchant, and Raja Ibrahim, the son of the Princess of Rokan. He was succeeded by his younger son, Raja Ibrahim, who reigned as Sultan Abu Syahid Shah (r. 1444\u20131446). Abu Syahid was a weak ruler and his administration was largely controlled by Raja Rokan, a cousin of his mother who stayed in the court of Malacca during his reign. The situation prompted the court officials to plan the assassination of Raja Rokan and to install Abu Syahid's older brother Raja Kasim to the throne. Both the Sultan and Raja Rokan were eventually killed in the attack in 1446. Raja Kasim was then appointed as the fifth ruler of Malacca and reign as Sultan Muzaffar Shah (r. 1446\u20131459). A looming threat from the Siamese kingdom of Ayuthaya became a reality when it launched a land invasion of Malacca in 1446. Tun Perak, the chief of Klang brought his men to help Malacca in the battle against the Siamese of which Malacca emerged victorious. His strong leadership qualities gained the attention of the Sultan, whose desire to see Malacca prosper made him appointing Tun Perak as the Bendahara. In 1456, during the reign of King Trailokanat, the Siamese launched another attack, this time by sea. When the news about the attack reached Malacca, naval forces were immediately rallied and a defensive line was made near Batu Pahat. The forces were commanded by Tun Perak and assisted by Tun Hamzah, a warrior by the nickname Datuk Bongkok. The two sides were ultimately clashed in a fierce naval battle. Nevertheless, the more superior Malaccan navy succeeded in driving off the Siamese, pursuing them to Singapura and forcing them to return home. Malacca's victory in this battle gave it new confidence to devise strategies to extend its influence throughout the region. The defeat of Siam brought political stability to Malacca and enhanced its reputation in South East Asia.\n\n\n== Golden era ==\n\nMalacca reached its height of glory at the beginning the middle of the 15th century. Its territory extended from modern-day Southern Thailand in the north to most of eastern coast of Sumatra in the south after wrestling it from Majapahit and Ayuthaya sphere of influence. The kingdom conveniently controls the global trade vital choke point; the narrow strait that today bears its name, Straits of Malacca. Its port city had become the centre of regional and international trade, attracting regional traders as well as traders from other Eastern civilisations such as the Chinese Empire and the Ryukyu and Western civilisations such as Persian, Gujarat and Arabs.The reign of Muzaffar Shah's son, Sultan Mansur Shah (r.1459\u20131477) witnessed the major expansion of the sultanate to reach its greatest extent of influence. Among the earliest territory ceded to the sultanate was Pahang, with its capital, Inderapura \u2013 a massive unexplored land with a large river and abundant source of gold which was ruled by Maharaja Dewa Sura, a relative of the King of Ligor. The Sultan dispatched a fleet of two hundred ships, led by Tun Perak and 19 Malaccan hulubalangs' ('commanders'). On reaching Pahang, a battle broke out in which the Pahangites were decisively defeated and its entire royal court were captured. The Malaccan fleet returned home with Dewa Sura and his daughter, Wanang Seri who were handed over to Sultan Mansur Shah. The Sultan appointed Tun Hamzah to rule Pahang. A policy of rapprochement with Ligor was later initiated by Mansur Shah to ensure steady supplies of rice.The military prowess of the sultanate was further strengthened by the nine elite knights of the kingdom. They were Hang Tuah, Hang Jebat, Hang Kasturi, Hang Lekir, Hang Lekiu, Hang Ali, Hang Iskandar, Hang Hasan and Hang Husain. Hang Tuah, the most intelligent among them is able to speak fluently 12 languages including Mandarin, Arabic, Javanese, Persian, and Japanese. He is skillful with weaponries such as the sword, keris, long keris, bow, cross bow and spear. He was the leader among them and was conferred the office of laksamana ('admiral') by the Sultan.\nOn his royal visit to Majapahit, Mansur Shah was also accompanied by these warriors. At that time, Majapahit was already at a declining state and found itself unable to overcome on the rising power of the Malay sultanate. After a display of Malaccan military prowess in his court, the king of Majapahit, afraid of losing more territories, had agreed to marry off his daughter, Raden Galuh Cendera Kirana to Sultan Mansur Shah and relinquished control over Indragiri, Jambi, Tungkal and Siantan to Malacca.The friendly relations between China and Malacca escalated during the reign of Sultan Mansur Shah. The Sultan sent an envoy headed by Tun Perpatih Putih to China, carrying a diplomatic letter from the Sultan to the Emperor. According to the Malay Annals, Tun Perpatih succeeded in impressing the Emperor of China with the fame and grandeur of Sultan Mansur Shah that the Emperor decreed that his daughter, Hang Li Po, should marry the Sultan. A senior minister of state and five hundred ladies in waiting accompanied the princess to Malacca. The Sultan built a palace for his new consort on a hill known ever afterwards as Bukit Cina (\"Chinese Hill\"). As trade flourished and Malacca became more prosperous, Mansur Shah ordered the construction of a large and beautiful palace at the foot of Malacca Hill. The royal palace reflected the wealth, prosperity and power of Malacca and embodied the excellence and distinct characteristics of Malay architecture.The brief conflict between Malacca and L\u00ea Dynasty of Annam, began shortly after the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, then already a Muslim kingdom. The Chinese government, without knowing about the event, sent a censor Ch'en Chun to Champa in 1474 to install the Champa King, but he discovered Vietnamese soldiers had taken over Champa and were blocking his entry. He proceeded to Malacca instead and its ruler sent back tribute to China. In 1469, Malaccan envoys on their return from China was attacked by the Vietnamese who castrated the young and enslaved them. In view of L\u00ea Dynasty's position as a protectorate to China, Malacca abstained from any act of retaliation. Instead, Malacca sent envoys to China in 1481 to report on the Vietnamese aggression and their invasion plan against Malacca, as well as to confront the Vietnamese envoys who happened to be present in the Ming court. However, the Chinese informed that since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor sent a letter to the Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also granted permission for Malacca to retaliate with violent force should the Vietnamese attack, an event that never happened again after that.\nThe Vietnamese with full force battalion were heavily defeated by outnumbered Malacca battalion during an invasion of Lan Sang as reported in a Chinese account.\n\nThe expansionist policy of Mansur Shah was maintained throughout his reign when he later added Kampar and Siak to his realm. He also turned a number of states in the archipelago into his imperial dependencies. The ruler of such states would come to Malacca after their coronation to obtain the blessing of the Sultan of Malacca. Rulers who have been overthrown also came to Malacca requesting the Sultan's aid in reclaiming their throne. One such examples was Sultan Zainal Abidin of Pasai who was toppled by his own relatives. He fled to Malacca and pleaded with Sultan Mansur Shah to reinstall him as a ruler. Malacca armed forces were immediately sent to Pasai and defeated the usurpers. Although Pasai never came under the control Malacca afterwards, the event greatly demonstrated the importance of Malacca and the mutual support it had established among leaders and states in the region. While Malacca was at the peak of its splendour, Sultan Mansur Shah died in 1477.\nThe prosperous era of Malacca continued under the rule of his son, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah (r. 1477\u20131488) and more foreign rulers within the region began paying homage to the Sultan of Malacca. Among them were a ruler from the Moluccas Islands who were defeated by his enemies, a ruler of Rokan and a ruler named Tuan Telanai from Terengganu. Alauddin Riayat Shah was a ruler who placed a great importance in maintaining peace and order during his reign. He was succeeded by his son, Sultan Mahmud Shah (r. 1488\u20131511) who was a teenage boy upon his accession. Hence Malacca was administered by Bendahara Tun Perak with the help of other senior officials. The legendary Princess of Gunung Ledang was said to have lived during the reign of Mahmud Shah and once wooed by the sultan himself. The town of Malacca continues to flourish and prosper with an influx of foreign traders after the appointment of Tun Mutahir as Bendahara. This was due to his efficient and wise administration and his ability to attract more foreign traders to Malacca. By about 1500, Malacca was at the height of its power and glory. Its city of Malacca was the capital of a great Malay empire, the chief centre of trade in Indian cloth, Chinese porcelain and silk and Malay spices, and the headquarters of Muslim activity in the Malay Archipelago. Malacca was still looking to expand its territory as late as 1506, when it conquered Kelantan.\n\n\n=== Portuguese invasion ===\n\nBy the 15th century, Europe had developed an insatiable appetite for spices. At that time, spice trade was virtually monopolised by the Venetian merchants via a convoluted trade route through Arabia and India, which in turn linked to its source in Spice Islands via Malacca. Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal determined to break this chain and control the lucrative spice trade directly from its source. This led to the expansion of Portuguese sea exploration, pioneered by Vasco da Gama, into the east coasts of India that had resulted in the establishment of Portuguese stronghold in Calicut.\nYears later, during the reign of Manuel I, a fidalgo named Diogo Lopes de Sequeira was assigned to analyse the trade potentials in Madagascar and Malacca. He arrived in Malacca on 1 August 1509 carrying with him a letter from the King. His mission was to establish trade with Malacca. The Tamil Muslims who were now powerful in the Malaccan court and friendly with Tun Mutahir, the Bendahara, were hostile towards the Christian Portuguese.The Gujarati merchants who were also Muslims and had known the Portuguese in India, preached a holy war against \"the infidels\". Unfortunately, because of the dissension between Mahmud Shah and Tun Mutahir, a plot was hatched to kill de Sequeira, imprison his men and capture the Portuguese fleet anchored off the Malacca River. The plot leaked out and de Sequeira managed to escape from Malacca in his ship, leaving behind several of his men as captives.Meanwhile, the position of the Portuguese in India was consolidated with the arrival of a new Viceroy, Afonso de Albuquerque, who conquered Goa in 1510. Having established Goa as the Portuguese eastern headquarters and naval base, de Albuquerque decided to capture Malacca and in April 1511, left Goa with 18 ships and 1400 men, comprising both Portuguese troops and Indian auxiliaries. Upon their arrival in Malacca, the Portuguese did not attack immediately, but instead began negotiations for the return of their prisoners while the at same time tried to find any insider information regarding the Malacca Fortress. Malacca procrastinated, thinking it could withstand a Portuguese assault, which started three months later on 25 July 1511. After many failed attempts, the breakthrough was made when the Portuguese bribed an insider of the fortress. The main post gate of the fortress was opened up to allow the Portuguese army to rush through the main gate. The Malaccan army was unprepared for the surprise attack and the invasion concluded on 24 August when de Albuquerque's troops, marching six abreast through the streets, swept aside all resistance. By the time they sacked the city and the palace, Sultan Mahmud Shah had already retreated.\n\n\n== Post-1511 ==\n\n\n=== Portuguese Malacca ===\n\nFollowing the 1511 conquest, the great Malay city port of Malacca passed into Portuguese hands and for the next 130 years remained under Portuguese governance despite incessant attempts by the former rulers of Malacca and other regional powers to dislodge the Europeans. Around the foot hill on which the Sultan's Istana once stood, the Portuguese built the stone fort known as A Famosa, completed in 1512. Malay graves, the mosque and other buildings were dismantled to obtain the stone from which, together with laterite and brick, the fort was built. Despite numerous attacks, the fort was only breached once, when the Dutch and Johor defeated the Portuguese in 1641.\nIt soon became clear that Portuguese control of Malacca did not mean they now controlled Asian trade that centred on it. Their rule in Malacca was marred with difficulties. They could not become self-sufficient and remained highly dependent on Asian suppliers, as had their Malay predecessors. They were short of both funds and manpower and the administration was hampered by organizational confusion and command overlap, corruption and inefficiency. Competition from other regional ports such as Johor which was founded by the exiled Sultan of Malacca, saw Asian traders bypass Malacca and the city began to decline as a trading port. Rather than achieving their ambition of dominating it, the Portuguese had fundamentally disrupted the organisation of the Asian trade network. The previously centralised port of exchange that policed the Straits of Malacca to maintain its safety for commercial traffic, was replaced with scattered trading network over a number of ports rivalling each other in the Straits.The efforts to propagate Christianity which was also one of the principal aims of Portuguese imperialism did not, however, meet with much success, primarily because Islam was already strongly entrenched among the local population.\n\n\n=== Chinese retaliation ===\n\nThe Portuguese conquest of Malacca enraged the Zhengde Emperor of China when he received the envoys from the exiled Sultan Mahmud. The furious Chinese emperor responded with brutal force, culminating the period of three decades of prosecution of Portuguese in China.\nAmong the earliest victims were the Portuguese envoys led by Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1516 that were greeted with great hostility and suspicion. The Chinese confiscated all of the Portuguese property and goods in the Pires embassy's possession. Many of the envoys were imprisoned, tortured and executed. Pires himself was said among those who died in the Chinese dungeons. Two successive Portuguese fleets bound for China in 1521 and 1522 were attacked and defeated in the first and second Battle of Tamao.\nIn response to Portuguese piracy and the illegal installation of bases in Fujian at Wuyu island and Yue harbour at Zhangzhou, Shuangyu island in Zhejiang, and Nan'ao island in Guangdong, the Imperial Chinese Right Deputy Commander Zhu Wan exterminated all the pirates and razed the Shuangyu Portuguese base, using force to prohibit trading with foreigners by sea. Moreover, Chinese traders boycotted Malacca after it fell under Portuguese control, with some Chinese in Java even assisting in Muslim attempts to invade the city.However, with gradual improvement of relations and aid given against the Japanese Wokou pirates along China's shores, by 1557 Ming China finally agreed to allow the Portuguese to settle at Macau in a new Portuguese trade colony. The Malay Sultanate of Johor also improved relations with the Portuguese.\n\n\n=== Successors of Malacca ===\n\nThe exiled Sultan Mahmud Shah made several attempts to retake the capital but his efforts were fruitless. The Portuguese retaliated and forced the Sultan to flee to Pahang. Later, the Sultan sailed to Bintan and established his capital there. From the new base, the Sultan rallied the disarrayed Malay forces and organised several attacks and blockades against the Portuguese's position. Frequent raids on Malacca caused the Portuguese severe hardship. The raids helped convince the Portuguese that the exiled Sultan's forces must be silenced once for all. A number of attempts were made to suppress the Malay forces, but it wasn't until 1526 that the Portuguese finally razed Bintan to the ground. The Sultan then retreated to Kampar in Sumatra where he died two years later. He left behind two sons named Muzaffar Shah and Alauddin Riayat Shah II.\nMuzaffar Shah was invited by the people in the north of the peninsula to become their ruler, establishing the Sultanate of Perak. Meanwhile, Mahmud Shah's other son, Alauddin succeeded his father and established the Sultanate of Johor. Malacca was later conquered by the Dutch in a joint military campaign in January 1641. The Portuguese fortress, however, did not fall to the force of Dutch or Johorean arms as much as to famine and disease that had brutally decimated the surviving population. As a result of mutual agreement between the Dutch and Johor earlier in 1606, Malacca was handed over to the Dutch.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nMalacca had a well-defined government with a set of laws. On top of the sultanate's hierarchy sat the Sultan and he was an absolute monarch. The earlier Srivijayan concept of kingship that the king's authority to rule was based on legitimate lineage still prevailed, and with the coming of Islam, it was reintroduced with the name daulat (sovereignty). Malacca's legal codes identified four main state officials appointed by the Sultan.Below the Sultan was a Bendahara, a position similar to that of a vizier, who acted as an advisor to the Sultan. It was the highest-ranking office that could be held by any common people in Malacca. Bendahara was also responsible for ensuring cordial relations with foreign states. Malacca's fifth Bendahara, Tun Perak, excelled in both war and diplomacy. Twice during the reign of Sultan Muzaffar Shah, Tun Perak successfully led Malaccan armed forces in repelling Siamese attacks on Malacca. When Sultan Mansur Shah ascended the throne, acting on Tun Perak's advice, he agreed to dispatch a peace envoy to Siam. Tun Perak also advised the Sultan to marry the daughter of the King of Majapahit, Malacca's traditional enemy.Next to Bendahara was a state treasurer, called Penghulu bendahari.  Later comes the Temenggung which more or less a chief of public police and state security. After Temenggung, a Laksamana's authority is paramount. He was the head of the navy and also chief emissary of the Sultan. He ensured that the Malacca Straits was safe and enforced the Undang-Undang Laut Melaka ('Maritime Laws of Malacca'). Malacca's most prominent Laksamana was the legendary Hang Tuah. At the bottom of this nobility structure is the four Shahbandars ('harbour masters') for the different communities in the port \u2013 one focused exclusively on handling the affairs of the Gujarati traders; another was responsible for traders from Southern India, Bengal, Burma and Pasai; a third for traders from Maritime Southeast Asia; and fourth for traders from Annam, China and the Ryukyu Islands. As the Gujaratis were the most dominant, numbering up to 1000 traders, their Shahbandar was regarded as the most important of the four. Lesser titled state officials were also appointed. They were known as the Orang Besar. In addition, a governor called the Mandulika oversaw the administration of appanages and territories annexed by conquest.The sultanate was governed with several set of laws. The formal legal text of traditional Malacca consisted of the Undang-Undang Melaka (Laws of Malacca), variously called the Hukum Kanun Melaka and Risalat Hukum Kanun, and the Undang-Undang Laut Melaka (the Maritime Laws of Malacca'). The laws as written in the legal digests went through an evolutionary process. The legal rules that eventually evolved were shaped by three main influences, namely the early non-indigenous Hindu/Buddhist tradition, Islam and the indigenous \"adat\".\n\n\n== Islam and Malay culture ==\nThe conversion of the first ruler of Malacca, Parameswara, to Islam was unclear so far with no evidence as to whether he had actually converted. The 16th-century Portuguese writer Tom\u00e9 Pires explicitly mentioned that Parameswara was succeeded by his son, Megat Iskandar Shah, and that only the latter converted to Islam at the age 72. On the other hand, the Malay Annals noted that it was during the reign of the third ruler Muhammad Shah, that the ruling class and the subjects began accepting Islam. While there are differing views on when the Islamization of Malacca actually took place, it is generally agreed that Islam was firmly established during the reign of Muzaffar Shah.Islamisation in the region surrounding Malacca gradually intensified between the 15th and 16th centuries through study centres in Upeh, the district on the north bank of the Malacca River. Islam spread from Malacca to Jambi, Kampar, Bengkalis, Siak, Aru and the Karimun Islands in Sumatra, throughout much of the Malay peninsula, Java and even Philippines. The Malay Annals even reveals that the courts of Malacca and Pasai posed theological questions and problems to one another. Of the so-called Wali Sanga ('nine saints') responsible in spreading Islam on Java, at least two, Sunan Bonang and Sunan Kalijaga, are said to have studied in Malacca. The Portuguese apothecary and chronicler at the time of Malacca's fall, Tome Pires, in his Suma Oriental mentions that the rulers of Kampar and Indragiri on the east coast of Sumatra converted to Islam as a result of Sultan Muzaffar Shah's influence and went on to study the religion in Malacca. The Malay Annals also mentions a number of scholars who served at the Malacca royal court as teachers and counselors to the various Sultans. Maulana Abu Bakar served in the court of Sultan Mansur Shah and introduced the Kitab Darul Manzum, a theological text translated from the work of an Arab scholar in Mecca. A scholar by the name of Maulana Kadi Sardar Johan served as a religious teacher to both Sultan Mahmud Shah and his son. In addition to Kitab Darul Manzum, the Malay Annals also mentions the Kitab al-luma' fi tasawwuf ('Book of Flashes'), a 10th-century treatise on Sufism by Abu Nasr al-Sarraj.Certain elaborate ceremonies that blend Islamic traditions with local culture were also began taking shape during Malaccan era. One of the example was recorded during the reign of Muhammad Shah. A special ceremony was held that marked the celebration of the 27th night of Ramadan, the Laylat al-Qadr. It began with a daytime procession, led by the Temenggung on elephant-back, conveying the Sultan's prayer mat to the mosque for Tarawih performed after the mandatory night prayers. On the following day the Sultan's turban would be carried in procession to the mosque. Similar ceremonies accompanied the grand celebrations of both Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Aidiladha. Apparently Malaccan Malay society had become so infused with the Islamic worldview that on the eve of the fall of Malacca, warriors at the court requested copies of two Islamic heroic epics, the Hikayat Amir Hamzah and the Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah, to inspire them in battle the next day. These two epics, still read today, tell of heroes fighting in the defence of Islam.The rise of Malacca as a centre of Islam had a number of crucial implications. Firstly, Islam transformed the notion of kingship so that the Sultan was no longer viewed as divine, but as God's Khalifah (vice-gerent on earth). Secondly, Islam was an important factor in enabling Malacca to foster good relations with other Islamic polities, including the Ottoman Empire, thereby attracting Muslim traders to Malacca.  Thirdly, Islam brought many great transformation into Malaccan society and culture, and ultimately it became a definitive marker of a Malay identity. This identity was in turn enriched further through the standards set by Malacca in some important aspects of traditional Malay culture, notably in literature, architecture, culinary traditions, traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions. Over time, this common Malay cultural idiom came to characterise much of the Maritime Southeast Asia through the Malayisation.\n\n\n== Trade ==\n\nMalacca developed from a small settlement to a cosmopolitan entrepot within the span of a century. This rapid progression was attributable to several factors, key among which were its strategic location along one of the World's most important shipping lanes, Malacca Straits and the increasing demand for commodities from both the East and the West. Ships from the east bearing goods from China, Ryukyu, Java and Maluku Islands would sail in by the northeast monsoon from December to January, while ships leaving for ports along Indian coastline, the Red Sea and East Africa would sail with the southwest monsoon.There were other ports along the Malacca Straits such as Kedah in the Peninsula and Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra, yet none of them came close to challenging Malacca's success as a centre of international trade. Malacca had an edge over these ports because its Rulers created an environment that was safe and conducive for business. Chinese records of the mid-15th century stated that Malacca flourished as a centre for trade on account of its effective security measures. It also had a well-equipped and well-managed port. Among the facilities provided for merchants were warehouses, where they could safely house their goods as they awaited favourable trade winds, as well as elephants for transporting goods to the warehouses. Malacca's management of its ethnically diverse merchant population \u2013 it is said that 84 different languages were spoken in Malacca during its heyday- is particularly telling. To administer the cosmopolitan marketplace, the traders were grouped according to region and placed under one of four shahbandars.Malacca had few domestic products with which to trade. It produced small amounts of tin and gold as well as dried fish, yet even the salt for preserving the fish had to be sourced from elsewhere in the region. Basic goods, including vegetables, cattle and fish, were supplied by Malacca's trading partners. Rice, mainly for local consumption, was imported. Much of the mercantile activity in Malacca, therefore, relied on the flow of goods from other parts of the region. Among Malacca's most crucial functions was its role as both a collection centre for cloves, nutmeg and mace from the Spice Islands and a redistribution centre for cotton textiles from ports in Gujarat, the Coromandel Coast, Malabar Coast and Bengal. Other goods traded in Malacca included porcelain, silk and iron from China and natural products of the Malay archipelago, such as camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, fish roe and seaweed. From the coastal regions on both sides of Malacca Straits came forest products; rattan, resin, roots and wax, and some gold and tin. These goods were then shipped to ports west of Malacca especially Gujarat.Tin ingots were a trading currency unique to Malacca. Cast in the shape of a peck, each block weighs just over one pound. Ten blocks made up one unit called a 'small bundle', and 40 blocks made up one 'large bundle'. Gold and Silver coins were also issued by Malacca as trading currency within the kingdom.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMalacca sultanate heralded the golden age of Alam Melayu and became an important port in the far east during the 16th century. It became so rich that the Portuguese writer and trader Tome Pires said \"Whoever is lord of Malacca shall have his hands on the throat of Venice.\". Within a span of a century, the Malay empire left a lasting and important legacy, especially within Malay culture and the History of Malaysia. Malacca was the first Malay Muslim state that achieved the status of a regional maritime power. Despite the existence of earlier Muslim kingdoms such as Kedah, Samudra Pasai and Aru, which also possessed well-established ports, none of them came close in challenging Malacca's success in expanding its territory and influence in the region. Malacca also contributed in the evolution of a common Malay culture based on Islam by incorporating native and Hindu-Buddhist ideas and layered them extensively with Islamic ideas and values. Through its traditions, laws, and royal rituals and customs, the Malaccan court set the example for later Muslim sultanates in the region to follow.\nNext to its role on promoting Islamic faith, Malacca is important especially for the modern nation of Malaysia as it was the first centralised polity that consolidated the entire Malay peninsula-now an important part of Malaysia- under its rule. This is contrary with the achievements of older kingdoms of the Malay Peninsula such as Kedah and Langkasuka that only exerted their influence over a significant northern portion of the peninsula. Because of these roles, Malacca is considered by many to be the spiritual birthplace of Malaysia. After the Sultanate of Malacca empire fell to Portugal in 1511, Sultan Mahmud Syah I retreated to Kampar, Sumatra, he left behind two princes named Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II and Sultan Muzaffar Shah. The two princes went on to establish the Sultanate of Perak  and Sultanate of Johor.\nMalacca sultanate also emerged as the primary base in continuing the historic struggles of its predecessors, Singapura and Srivijaya, against their Java-based nemeses. By the mid 15th century, Majapahit found itself unable to control the rising power of Malacca that began to gain effective control of Malacca straits and expands its influence to Sumatra. As a major entrepot, Malacca attracted Muslim traders from various part of the world and became a centre of Islam, disseminating the religion throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia. The expansion of Islam into the interiors of Java in the 15th century led to the gradual decline of Majapahit, before it finally succumbed to the emerging local Muslim forces in the early 16th century. At the same time, the literary tradition of Malacca developed the Classical Malay that eventually became the lingua franca of the region. The advent of Islam coupled with flourishing trade that used Malay as medium of communication, culminated the domination of Malacca and other succeeding Malay-Muslim sultanates in the Maritime Southeast Asia. As noted by certain scholars, the historic Malay-Javanese rivalry in the region, persists until modern times, and continues to shape the diplomatic relations between the Malaysia and the Java-based Indonesia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Sunni Muslim dynasties\nSultanate of Riau-Lingga\nSultanate of Johor\nSultanate of Kedah\nSultanate of Brunei\nSultanate of Singgora\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "wiki": "Christ Church Malacca is an 18th-century Anglican church in the city of Malacca City, Malaysia. It is the oldest functioning Protestant church in Malaysia and is within the jurisdiction of the Lower Central Archdeaconry of the Anglican Diocese of West Malaysia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Dutch conquest of Malacca from the Portuguese Empire in 1641 saw the proscription of Roman Catholicism and the conversion of existing churches to Dutch Reformed use. The old St. Paul's Church at the summit of St. Paul Hill was renamed the Bovenkerk (Upper Church) and used as the main parish church of the Dutch community.\nIn 1741, in commemoration of the centenary of the capture of Malacca from the Portuguese, the Dutch burgher community decided to build a new church to replace the ageing Bovenkerk. The foundation stone was laid by the Malacca born Captain of the Malacca Burghers, Abraham de Wind, on behalf of his father, Claas de Wind, a prominent Burgher who had been the Secunde (Deputy Governor) of Malacca. The church was completed 12 years later in 1753 and replaced the Bovenkerk as the primary Dutch Reformed Church in Dutch Malacca.With the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, possession of Malacca was transferred to the British East India Company and in 1838, the church was re-consecrated with the rites of the Church of England by Daniel Wilson, Bishop of Calcutta and renamed Christ Church. The maintenance of the church was taken over by the Government of the Straits Settlements in 1858.Originally painted white, the church and the neighbouring Stadthuys building was painted red in 1911 and this distinctive colour scheme has remained the hallmark of Malacca's Dutch-era buildings since.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church is built in Dutch Colonial architecture style and is laid out in a simple rectangle of 82 feet (25 m) by 42 feet (13 m). The ceiling rises to 40 feet (12 m) and is spanned by wooden beams, each carved from a single tree. The roof is covered with Dutch tiles and the walls were raised using Dutch bricks built on local laterite blocks then coated with Chinese plaster. The floors of the church are paved with granite blocks originally used as ballast for merchant ships.The original Dutch windows were reduced and ornamented after the British takeover of Malacca and the porch and vestry were built only in the mid-19th century.\n\n\n== Artifacts ==\n\n\n=== Tombstones and memorial plaques ===\nThe floors of the church also incorporate various tombstones with Portuguese and Armenian inscriptions used as paving blocks. Memorial plaques in Dutch, Armenian and English also adorn the interior of the church. Some Armenian inscriptions provide an interesting panorama of life in the Dutch period:\nGreetings, you who are reading this tablet of my tomb in which I now sleep. Give me the news, the freedom of my countrymen, for them I did much weep. If there arose among them one good guardian to govern and keep. Vainly I expected the world to see a good shepherd came to look after the scattered sheep.\nI, Jacob, grandson of Shamier, an Armenian of a respectable family whose name I keep, was born in Persia near Inefa, where my parents now forever sleep. Fortune brought me to distant Malacca, which my remains in bondage to keep. Separated from the world on 7th July 1774 A.D. at the age of twenty-nine, my mortal remains were deposited in this spot of the ground which I purchased.\n\n\n=== Church bell ===\nThe church bell is inscribed with the date 1698 suggesting that it was used for another purpose prior to the completion of the church.\n\n\n=== Church administration records ===\nThe church's collection of Kerk Boek (Church Book), Resolutie Boek (Resolution Book), Rapporten (Reports) as well as the Doop Boek (Baptism Register) going back to the earliest Dutch times in Malacca have survived through the centuries. These antiquated documents are now being kept at the National Archives of Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Silver altar vessels ===\nSilver altar vessels dating back to the early Dutch period are also in the possession of the church but is kept in storage and rarely taken out for display.\n\n\n=== Altar Bible ===\nThe altar Bible has a cover made of brass inscribed with the passage from John 1:1 in Dutch.\n\n\n== Service ==\n3 Sunday services are held in this church (English 8.30am, Mandarin 10.30am, Malay 4.30pm) and at Merlimau (7pm).\n\n\n== See also ==\nChurch of the Province of South East Asia\nDutch Reformed Church\nDutch Malacca\nDutch East India Company\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notations ===\nDe Witt, Dennis (2010).

          "Unfortunately for me, the church wasn't actually open while I was in town but it was still worth seeing the outside and sort of taking in the ambiance of \"Red Square.\" It's sort of unfortunate that the busiest road in town runs right beside the church and square but what can you",

        "wiki": "Malacca (Malay: Melaka; Tamil: \u0bae\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe; Chinese: \u99ac\u516d\u7532; pinyin: M\u01celi\u00f9ji\u01ce), dubbed \"The Historic State\", is a state in Malaysia located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula, next to the Strait of Malacca.\nThe state is bordered by Negeri Sembilan to the north and west and Johor to the south. The exclave of Cape Rachado also borders Negeri Sembilan to the north. Its capital is Malacca City, which is 148 kilometres (92 miles) southeast of Malaysia's capital city Kuala Lumpur, 235 kilometres (146 miles) northwest of Johor's largest city Johor Bahru and 95 km (59 miles) northwest of Johor's second largest city, Batu Pahat. This historical city centre has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 7 July 2008.Although it was the location of one of the earliest Malay sultanates, the local monarchy was abolished when the Portuguese conquered it in 1511. The head of state is the Yang di-Pertua Negeri or Governor, rather than a Sultan. Melaka is famous for its unique history and is one of the major tourist destinations in Malaysia. With a highly strategic state position for international trade routes, Malacca was once a well-known international trade center in the East. Many traders anchored in Malacca, especially traders from Arabia, China and India, traded at the port of Malacca and from there were born many of the descendants and tribes that exist in Malacca to this day.\nThe harmonious life and ambience of the people of Malacca is attributed to the life of various races and ethnicities that have long existed among the local community. Malays, Malaysian Chinese, Malaysian Indians, Baba Nyonya, Kristang, Chitty and Eurasians are important ethnic groups living in the State of Malacca up to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Sultanate of Malacca ===\n\nBefore the arrival of the first Sultan, Malacca was a fishing village inhabited by local inhabitants known as Orang Laut. Malacca was founded by Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah. He found his way to Malacca around 1402 where he found a good port\u2014it was accessible in all seasons and on the strategically located narrowest point of the Malacca Straits. In 1403, the first official Chinese trade envoy led by Admiral Yin Qing arrived in Malacca. Later, Parame\u015bwara was escorted by Zheng He and other envoys in his successful visits. Malacca's relationships with Ming China granted it protection from attacks by Siam and Majapahit. Malacca officially submitted to Ming China as a protectorate. This encouraged the development of Malacca into a major trade settlement on the trade route between China and India, Middle East, Africa and Europe.According to a popular legend, Parameswara was resting under a tree near a river during a hunt, when one of his dogs cornered a mouse deer. In self-defence, the mouse deer pushed the dog into the river. Impressed by the courage of the deer, and taking it as a propitious omen of the weak overcoming the powerful, Parameswara decided then and there to found an empire on that very spot. He named it 'Malacca' after the tree where he had just taken shelter at, the Malacca tree (Malay: Pokok Melaka).Winstedt suggested that the mouse deer story is likely a story modified from a folk-tale from Kandy, Sri Lanka. And more recently, Ahmat Adam pointed out the another possible source of the mouse deer story in his recent romanization work on Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai. Since the founding of Kandy and Pasai predate Melaka, it is not unsafe to conclude that the Melaka version of mouse deer is borrowed and adapted from them.\nIn collaboration with allies from the sea-people (orang laut), the wandering proto-Malay privateers of the Straits, he established Malacca as an international port by compelling passing ships to call there, and establishing fair and reliable facilities for warehousing and trade.\n\nIn Malacca during the early 15th century, Ming China actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for their treasure voyages into the Indian Ocean. Malacca had been a relatively insignificant region, not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both Ma Huan and Fei Xin, and was a vassal region of Siam. In 1405, the Ming court dispatched Admiral Zheng He with a stone tablet enfeoffing the Western Mountain of Malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country. The Chinese also established a government depot (\u5b98\u5ee0) as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers. Ma Huan reported that Siam did not dare to invade Malacca thereafter. The rulers of Malacca, such as Parameswara in 1411, would pay tribute to the Chinese emperor in person. In 1431, when a Malaccan representative complained that Siam was obstructing tribute missions to the Ming court, the Xuande Emperor dispatched Zheng He carrying a threatening message for the Siamese king saying \"You, king should respect my orders, develop good relations with your neighbours, examine and instruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or aggressively.\" The early kings of Malacca\u2014Parameswara, Megat Iskandar Shah, and Sri Maharaja\u2014understood that they could gain Ming China's protection through skillful diplomacy and thereby could establish a strong foundation to their kingdom against Siam and other potential enemies. Chinese involvement was crucial for Malacca to grow into a key alternative to other important and established ports.To enhance relations, Hang Li Po, according to local folklore, a daughter of the Ming Emperor of China, arrived in Malacca, accompanied by 500 attendants, to marry Sultan Manshur Shah who reigned from 1456 until 1477. Her attendants married locals and settled mostly in Bukit Cina.\n\n\"In the 9th month of the year 1481 envoys arrived with the [......] Malacca again sent envoys to China in 1481 to inform the Chinese that, while Malaccan envoys were returning to Malacca from China in 1469, the Vietnamese attacked the Malaccans, killing some of them while castrating the young and enslaving them. The Malaccans reported that Vietnam was in control of Champa and also sought to conquer Malacca, but the Malaccans did not fight back, because they did not want to fight against another state that was a tributary to China without permission from the Chinese. They requested to confront the Vietnamese delegation to China which was in China at the time, but the Chinese informed them since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor sent a letter to the Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also ordered the Malaccans to raise soldiers and fight back with violent force if the Vietnamese attacked them again.\n\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nIn April 1511, Alfonso de Albuquerque set sail from Goa to Malacca with a force of some 1200 men and seventeen or eighteen ships. They conquered the city on 24 August 1511. After seizing the city Afonso de Albuquerque spared the Hindu, Chinese and Burmese inhabitants but had the Muslim inhabitants massacred or sold into slavery.It soon became clear that Portuguese control of Malacca did not also mean they controlled Asian trade centred there. Their Malaccan rule was severely hampered by administrative and economic difficulties. Rather than achieving their ambition of dominating Asian trade, the Portuguese had disrupted the organisation of the network. The centralised port of exchange of Asian wealth had now gone, as was a Malay state to police the Straits of Malacca that made it safe for commercial traffic. Trade was now scattered over a number of ports among bitter warfare in the Straits.\n\nThe Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier spent several months in Malacca in 1545, 1546, and 1549. The Dutch launched several attacks on the Portuguese colony during the first four decades of the seventeenth century. The first attack took place in 1606 under the command of Dutch Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge who laid siege to the town with the help of his Johor allies. He engaged the Portuguese armada which had been sent from Goa to offer armed relief to the besieged port. On 14 January 1641, the Dutch defeated the Portuguese in an effort to capture Malacca, with the help of the Sultan of Johor. The Dutch ruled Malacca from 1641 to 1798 but they were not interested in developing it as a trading centre, placing greater importance on Batavia (Jakarta) and Java as their administrative centre. However they still built their landmark, better known as the Stadthuys. In the Dutch era the building was white, the red paint is of later date.\n\nMalacca was ceded to the British in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 in exchange for Bencoolen on Sumatra. From 1824 to 1942, Malacca was under the rule of the British, first by the British East India Company and then as a crown colony. Due to dissatisfaction with British jurisdiction over Naning, Dol Said, a local chief, fought the East India Company in a war from 1831 to 1832, which resulted in a decisive British victory. It formed part of the Straits Settlements, together with Singapore and Penang. Malacca went briefly under the rule of Empire of Japan in 1942\u20131945 during World War II.\n\n\n=== Post colonial era ===\nAfter the dissolution of this crown colony, Malacca and Penang became part of the Malayan Union on 1 April 1946, which later became the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948. The declaration of independence was made by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, at Padang Pahlawan on 20 February 1956, which eventually led to the independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957. On 16 September 1963, Malaysia was formed with the merger of Malaya with Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore, and Malacca became part of it. On 15 April 1989, Malacca was declared a historical city. It was then also listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 7 July 2008.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe state of Malacca covers an area of 1,664 km2 (642 sq mi). It sits upon the southwestern coast of the Malay Peninsula opposite Sumatra, with the state of Negeri Sembilan to the north and west and Johor to the east. Malacca is situated roughly two-thirds of the way down the west coast, 148 km (92 mi) south of Kuala Lumpur and commands a central position on the Straits of Malacca.

          "We walked along the Jonker street and expect to see nice street walk but to our disappointment some of the shop are dilapidated and closed. Hard to find good restaurant around the area for lunch. Nice Mural on few buildings. You have time can go for Cruise along Melaka River.",

          "We walk along Jonker street from H&M to the other end. A lot of souvenirs, street foods and drinks, t shirts etc. It was a good experience to see the lively night market. However, it was a little bit hard for us with a stroller to walk through.",
          "Jonker street has a popular night market with many stalls selling food and souvenirs. The room is closed to traffic during weekend nights. In the day time, there\u2019s also many shops along the street worth exploring selling unique souvenirs and food. Try Jonker 88 for chendol and",

          "We have visited Melaka before and Jonker street , but during the week . Well the weekend is crazily busy , the footpaths were difficult to walk along but the atmosphere was fantastic. The market sets up about 6 pm and there is a vast array of goods .",

          "Very busy street lined with stalls, hard to navigate and quite an experience but worth a visit for the experience",
          "The place is getting more and more commercialised every time I visit. The crowds continue to be crazy and there were many loud and noisy Chinese tourists. The usual stores that i see are slowly being replaced by many souvenir shops selling China made cheap souvenirs.",
          "Jonker Street is a place we visited many times, as there are many antique shops, all sorts of street food, many stalls at night and it is very enjoyable to just walk along the streets.",
          "We were in the area for a couple of nights and we walked around here a few times both day and night. The buildings are ok, there are shops and restaurants around. At night while we were walking this place had food stalls, gift stalls etc along the streets which the road had been",
          "Visited on Friday Night and again briefly on Saturday afternoon. On Friday the place is really thronged traffic is banned and no wonder . All forms of stalls and shops so there should be something for everyone. The following day the stalls are missing so you can visit the shops",
          "Enjoy the sights and sounds of the local streets. Lots of tourist but it was expected. Enjoyed snacks and food along the way as well. Famous for the chicken rice balls and chendol, so expect to see many stalls selling them.",

          "We visited the place several times during our recent trip to Melaka. There are many interesting stuff to see, a huge variety for food, as well as unique historical heritage museum to visit.",
          "I have been here many years ago, it was meh. I came here again recently and was surprised to see the improvements the government has made to preserve and the people were so friendly. Do not go on Mondays, as many shops will be closed. Weekends are too crowded and packed with",
          "A must visit street at Melaka. Many hidden gems (nice restaurants and cafe) within the street. A good mix of local and western influence. Pure Gula Melaka can be found everywhere. Unable to try all food within 2 days. It turned into a weekend night mkt too. There was a nostalgic",
          "We walked up and down the entire Jonker street on a Saturday afternoon. It was hot, but fun. Lots of shops and stalls, including a few antique stores and many options for street food. We all really enjoyed the experience. There is a square nearby that you can rent a bicycle cart",
          "I came here few years ago and it was awesome But today when I visited it's just full of food stalls not many other types of stalls like they used to have",
          "But a must when in Malacca. Some of t hff e old traditional shops are still there but they are being overwhelmed by the souvenir shops and restaurants in high tempo. So hurry to catch still a little if the o loo d days.",
          "Best to visit jonker street on the weekend evening. There will be a street market open until late night and you could buy plenty of things.After or before the street visit , you will definitely have ride of the decorated trishaws. Fun place with plenty of options to eat.",
          "We followed our tour guide for this short visit on the first Saturday of September 2019. This is a landmark that you need to visit in Malacca. (Nobody can claim to have been to Malacca if they have not visited Jonker Street, they say...) Our group arrived on Saturday, around",
          "Jonker Street features shops for local products and we bought stuff ranging from clogs to Melaka food produce to street food. We were there on Saturday when the weekend street bazaar is on. Happy we went at 4 pm just when stores were setting up as it got extremely crowded after",

          "Jonker Street is like a huge Chinatown with hipster cafes. Food is just ok compared to Singapore, HK and Taiwan. Worth a visit if you're already in Malacca.",
          "I love here very much,but the only concern is here is too crowd!!!but is a good place to buy souvenir for your friends.",
          "As the streets are narrow and business stalls are on both sides, the place becomes too crowded and difficult to even walk through, let alone stop to shop. Perhaps it would be better to have stalls only on one side and open up other streets for business. Food stalls and non food",
          "Very lifely. A mix of contemporary with historical experience. A lot to eat and buy as souviners, prices are reasonable (not that cheap). Lots to see and buy.",
          "Jonker street night market was the famous night market at malacca city, there was so much kind of signature malacca city streetfood. This night market better visit at weekend. We can go to Stadthuys place just 5 minutes from jonker street.",
          "Although the number of cars driving and down the street make it a bit annoying and perhaps a bit risky from a traffic perspective, Jonker Street (and really the whole area) is really fascinating to walk. There are all sorts of little shops and restaurants. I got a good meal",
          "My 2nd visit here only because this is my family first visit to Melaka. The place is too crowded, not much variety of food and merchandise to buy, and the food quality is low compared to other places in Melaka. The coconut drink is fine though. And I did my henna here too",
          "Pardon my title when I called Jonker Street bipolar... The place has a dual personality. At day time... it looks okay with a few people (depends on what day - weekend?, PH?). You can walk freely. But when the night falls, prepare a lot of patience especially during the weekends",
          "Jonker Street, Melaka is a small street in Chinatown in the city center. There aren\u2019t a lot of sightseeing opportunities along the street. The only attraction worth getting a quick glimpse of is the historic mausoleum of Hang Jebat \u2013the second most skillful of a band of five",
          "A visit to Melaka isn't complete without a visit to this street! Located in the heart of the 'touristy' area, it bustles from morning to night. In the daytime, it's easier to spot restaurants and cafes. You can find good chicken rice ball restaurants and trendy cafes; there are",
          "Jonker Street closes to traffic on weekend afternoons and turns into a lively night market with hundreds of stalls and stands to chose finger food, fruits and drinks from. Not to be missed if spending a night in Melaka.",

          "My research said that this was an important market street and that it was best to visit on a Friday or Saturday night when it turns into a pedestrian mall and stalls fill the street. I spent a lot of time trying to arrange my itinerary to do so and it fell into place but found",
          "Love the historical aura and authentic architecture of the buildings. The Heeren Street were lived by the first class people while the Jonker Street were for second class people, a fact I have just discovered. If you are looking for authentic details of the ancient Malaya,",

          "Usual night Market fare, excellent variety of food and desserts available. There is nearby nonya restaurant called the little nonya which served fairly good nonya food. The nearby department store shan shu gong also provided a great variety of dried foods for every taste.",
          "Supposed to be the most popular street in malacca and a must see and experience tourist spot. However, it was too crowded to truly enjoy the place. Most of the stalls are selling pretty similar stuffs. The food sold there are also pretty average.",
          "Jonker Street is a magical place to visit day or night, explore the shops cafes/restaurants museums interesting buildings and include the many side streets around Jonker Street . Part of a visit should include the weekend as the evening Market is only on at the weekend.Just be",
          "If you visit Melaka, this is definately one to visit in the evening. There are loads of bars and restaurants where you can have good meal and drinks. There are also streets of street vendors selling everything from handicrafts to local biscuits. English is well spoken there so",
          "Crowded with traffic jam. Better don\u2019t drive as it very hard to get the parking. Is loaded with foods and souvenirs but it seems that it lost it identity to carry the signature souvenirs of Malacca.",
          "As I said, it's night market same as everywhere nothing special . In a day I was there the street full with visitors very crowded I feel so bad. In my opinion it's not worth to visit.",
          "It's might interest for a tourist. As a Malaysian, I find it like a normal night matket, but there is still some stall which is quite special",
          "Great place to hang out actually but place becoming commercialised and things getting more expensive. No dust bins along the roadside.",
          "The street is fun but not during the market. You can hardly move, risk of pickpockets, the heat, the noise etc. All factor in to ruin the experience. Plus when you are stuck inside the market you can\u2019t even admire the building fa\u00e7ades! Market is only 17.00-24.00 so take the time",
          "Even when the place is crowded it is still a fun place for the family. The stuff they sell is not that great but the atmosphere is fun and the shops along the road are quite cool.",
          "Any visit to Maleka is incomplete without a thorough walk in Jonker street. As one of the oldest streets in town, you get the real taste of the city there as you are immersed in the local culture. Heavily influenced by Malay and Chinese traditions, you really feel exposed to the",
          "Here you can buy and eat street foods, from fresh seadood cooked on the spot to their local delicaies. Cheap items also can be found here. Building on the street was hiatorical. Hope to revisit this place again some other tine",
          "Colorful during nights but most of the store is closed. quit busy during morning. no easy to find parking",

          "Noisy and crowded but a good showcase of local culture, food and stalls galore Getting there by Grab is easy and convenient. The chicken rice balls stalls were not selling this at night to our disappointment!",
          "In the day you see one side of Jonker. And at night, there is another side of it... Both day and night are equally crowded. But at least at night you wont be knocked by umbrella used by shoppers. A must visit place for malacca, you can spend the whole afternoon til night here.",

          "Saturday night markets were great fun. Heaps of local food and culture. Very busy and quiet hot but the evening cools off a little. We enjoyed the atmosphere, interesting things for sale and just the bustle. Certainly worth a visit day or night. We did a short river cruise",
          "By day, the shops are busy and pretty standard \"Chinatown\", but by night, at the weekend, the night market is something else! We visited with our Chinese Malaysian friends who explained so much of what was sold and done, that we felt at ease and privileged. We spent over three",

          "Excellent vibrant historical journey durian musang peranakan place coffee Chinese association thumbsup.",
          "The busiest street of Melaka. It is loaded with shop, cafes, and restaurants. On weekend nights, it livens up with the Jonker Street Night Market. It becomes much more vibrant as sections of the street become crammed with vendors, shoppers, and sightseers.",
          "A must go place in Melaka!! Even more crowded at night! Cheap food and lots of shopping place ! Got home with a full stomach!",
          "It's the most popular weekend night market in Melaka. More than 200 stalls along 1km to offer local street foods & shopping option. Price is above par, bargain is required",
          "The Street is worth seeing,but it is not special. A lot of things that you can buy in every Chinese store... a lot of fake stuff. The street food is the strong part and it is worth it trying . I was surprised with the very rude way turist are treated. Very very rude people. One",

          "Weekend night markets are an attraction to people who love crowds looking for unique souvenirs plus the aroma of foods etc. Week days morning are a better time to admire the old charm of quaint and antique houses. And some unique cafes in the evening!",
          "Nice place to buy malacca products, place really crowded but good place to hang out in malacca. Nothing much to offer for teenagers. Good place to visit in malacca as most of the interesting places are around this area.",
          "it is wonderful to see the once upon a time way of life. the buildings are a little modernised with electricity and running water but the feel and look of the place is well from the past. even the upkeep of the whole place is in the past. lot of eating places and our driver was",
          "Located nearby Hard Rock Cafe, making this place easy to be reached and found. Tourists may try out local street foods, hand-made crafts, souvenirs, fancy hipster cafes, bars and bistros. I spent almost an hour wandering here at night :) Note: Beware, you might spend more",

          "Jonker Street & the adjacent streets is a chaotic mix of eateries, souvenir shops, some museums and galleries, boutique inns and a few reflexology shops. The problem is it is not conducive for pedestrians , given the constant traffic of cars and taxis. There are some attractive",
          "Jonkers street for me is what tousrism does to beautiful places if unchecked. What used to be a quaint place full of history has become a place to pick up pricey trinkets and have food and drinks that are a pale shade of what made the place famous in the first place. No doubt",
          "We had visited the night markets in Kuala Lumpur the night before and found Jonker Street so much better. A wide variety of goods and foods were available with vendors prepared to negotiate price. I highly recommend this attraction for anyone visiting Melaka.",
          "The last time I visited Jonker street was almost 3 years ago. I noticed that the variety of food and goods sold is disappointing and repetitive. Also, the price is a rip off for tourist. I would recommend you to go there for a walk to get a feel for Malaysia night market but",

          "The Main Street is about 1km long ... and chok full of curio shops and restaurants. At night it transforms to one of the more interesting street markets in the region ... selling street food, and knick-knacks of all dimensions. Brings to mind the Sihlin market in Taiwan ...",

          "We went there on Thursday (on May), the shops were opened but the street was almost empty. You can find there a lot of nice craftmade items. Then we went on Friday night and the street was full of street vendors and the atmosphere was exciting and enjoyable. We liked the street",

          "Unfortunately as we were here on a day trip from Kuala Lumpur, we only managed a quick walk along Jonker Street - just enough time for a coffee and some souvenirs. A busy street with traffic but our guide told us it is closed off in the evening, which would be much more",
          "Not sure what exactly is the hype here though. If you want to have a really good look, go during the day time. Visitors would not be able to see much at night because there are really a lot of people. So, be mindful.",
          "Open Friday- Sunday 6pm till 12am. If going with family which got eldest pls arrange earlier go buy foods. If not u will stuck on the traffic as the road there very small plus don\u2019t walk in the middle on the roads as it\u2019s hv car pass by on certain entrance so be careful.",

          "Pretty much like your average night market (pasar malam) at home. Cheap tshirts, mainly food stuff and some tacky souvenirs. Was very crowded on a Saturday night, and they blocked most of the shop entrances, which I would find pretty annoying if I was operating a shop on that",
          "During saturday night, they block the road from cars and motorcycle, and build a night market. There are uncountable variations of food and beverages, and all of them are reasonably priced. Other than food, thay also sell a lot of interesting and cheap souvenirs.",
          "Nothing much going on in here but busy over the weekend.. if in malacca it would be sorry if u dont visit ... lot of durian and gulamelaka based candies and sweet to taste and buy back home ..fresh coconut water , shake and lots of option for good cendol",

          "We went on a Tuesday night and it was closed! Barely a stall open! Spoke to a local who said Jonker Street comes alive on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and you can\u2019t move for people and traders - other days the stall holders don\u2019t open.",
          "Great for food, gifts and entertainment. I loved the karaoke on the main square and the dance in temples.",
          "Very happening only during the weekends. A place where you could find food, entertainment, Art & craft and street shopping especially neurons the night. Day time you could visit shops for clothing, souvenirs and food.",

          "We didn't spend much time walking on Jonker Street. Rather, we spent most afternoons understanding the local businesses and fine craftsmanship, from wooden clogs, paper cutting to watercolour gallery. We were particularly intrigued by a traditional shop beside Jonker Street",
          "You don't find any Baba Nyoya authentic food here. Just overpriced marketing and bad tasting food. Many vendors are not from that area. Too much hoo haa but nothing great!",

          "The overall experience in Jonker street can only be summed in one word..Congested! The street should be made more pedestrian friendly..cars and bikes zoom by the street even when the street is full of pedestrians..The authorities should probably review the traffic situation",
          "Many shops selling local titbits and snacks, plus local desserts like chendol, so one is spoilt for choice. The lanes are narrow (it is an old part of town anyway) so you have to be careful when moving around, as vehicles come quite close. The parking is limited due to the",

          "I don\u2019t care for places that bill themselves as night markets and don\u2019t really come close to a true night market like in Siem Reap or Phnom Penh. This is more of an arts and crafts deco thing. I like it but it\u2019s not a night market.",
          "jonker street is famous in the local for street foods and also small stalls selling all sort of staffs but I don't think it is cheap. what worth to eat is the young fresh coconut selling at the beginning of the street.. yummy!!",

          "A bit disappoint during the day that this street area was not \"happening\". Most of shops were closed even at 12 noon, which was too bad because we were unable to visit at night. The one shop that I did get to browse through was a pottery shop, which was nice, but more",

          "Without doubt, this has to be one of the overly visited places in Melaka, especially among visitors to the state. You can say that this place has been overly commercialised but despite that, it is still worth a visit. Considered as part of the old Melaka, Jonker Street",

          "This is a private museum and therefore kept really well. Strongly recommend the guided tour and its very affordable. We paid rm40 for 2 people. The tour is interesting and fun. Abit haunted looking, but all ancient chinese houses are like this here.",
          "The most impressive food ever! Love every food here! Must come here to taste the delicious food.",

          "They only have English speaking tour guide, or you can choose to be a self-guided tour. Do not allow to take photo in the museum.  Basically, the tour guide, Shirley is just okay on briefly introducing the Baba Nyonya culture. Frankly speaking, I would recommend Straits Chinese Jewellery Museum compare to this museum.",

          "Great traditional house with lots of explanations",
          "We went here and it looked interesting so we did the self guided tour for 16 MYR each.  Although it was cute to walk through and look around, I was not overly impressed. It is OK if you have nothing better to do, but IMHO not worth the money.",
          "Really nice! They give you a book for a self guided Tour inside the house.",
          "It's very interesting cross cultural experience.\nA marriage between the Chinese and Malays, hence there're elements from both culture seen in Baba and Nyonya homes.",

          "Very informative tour, with beautiful artefacts on display. No photos allowed beyond the waiting area, which is a bit of a bummer. I don't see a reason why we couldn't take photos. There were tourists flouting this rule and took photos covertly anyway.",
          "Guided Tours in the museum are scheduled so check the timing otherwise they'll provide you with a booklet for self guide. The uided tours gives you an insight as to what sort of lifestyle the rich Peranakan led. Call them to check on the last tour. Last intake is 45 minutes before closing time. Closed on gazetted national holidays.",
          "Family as a value has always been asia's number one priority. And it's a delight to see how one family history, held up high by the descendants. Baba & Nyonya is one of malacca founding father. A part of history. In a way, I found it \u2026",

          "Great place to explore a historical place with some antique souvenirs to bring home.",
          "Suggest to go for the guided tour rather than the self tour, a difference of RM4 only. It's worth the money. For kids on the guided tour, there is a free activity session for them @ FOC. Look out for the peep hole on the floor @ 1st floor of the wedding room",

          "I might not be the target audience for this. Very focused on that specific family's heritage and their way of life, which seemed extremely extravagant.",
          "It was nice but I expected more. They exhibited too much about the family histort who owns the museum, instead of the culture. And they don't let visitors take pics beyond the main entrance. I think you'll get to see more baba and nyonya cultures at the street and shops at jonker walk for free.",
          "When I arrived, I was a bit nervous about the tour. It takes time to be fully enveloped by the culture and traditions held by these Chinese ancestors. The staff was nice and quite kind. They were humourous from time to time which lightened \u2026",

        "wiki": "Malacca (Malay: Melaka; Tamil: \u0bae\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe; Chinese: \u99ac\u516d\u7532; pinyin: M\u01celi\u00f9ji\u01ce), dubbed \"The Historic State\", is a state in Malaysia located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula, next to the Strait of Malacca.\nThe state is bordered by Negeri Sembilan to the north and west and Johor to the south. The exclave of Cape Rachado also borders Negeri Sembilan to the north. Its capital is Malacca City, which is 148 kilometres (92 miles) southeast of Malaysia's capital city Kuala Lumpur, 235 kilometres (146 miles) northwest of Johor's largest city Johor Bahru and 95 km (59 miles) northwest of Johor's second largest city, Batu Pahat. This historical city centre has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 7 July 2008.Although it was the location of one of the earliest Malay sultanates, the local monarchy was abolished when the Portuguese conquered it in 1511. The head of state is the Yang di-Pertua Negeri or Governor, rather than a Sultan. Melaka is famous for its unique history and is one of the major tourist destinations in Malaysia. With a highly strategic state position for international trade routes, Malacca was once a well-known international trade center in the East. Many traders anchored in Malacca, especially traders from Arabia, China and India, traded at the port of Malacca and from there were born many of the descendants and tribes that exist in Malacca to this day.\nThe harmonious life and ambience of the people of Malacca is attributed to the life of various races and ethnicities that have long existed among the local community. Malays, Malaysian Chinese, Malaysian Indians, Baba Nyonya, Kristang, Chitty and Eurasians are important ethnic groups living in the State of Malacca up to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Sultanate of Malacca ===\n\nBefore the arrival of the first Sultan, Malacca was a fishing village inhabited by local inhabitants known as Orang Laut. Malacca was founded by Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah. He found his way to Malacca around 1402 where he found a good port\u2014it was accessible in all seasons and on the strategically located narrowest point of the Malacca Straits. In 1403, the first official Chinese trade envoy led by Admiral Yin Qing arrived in Malacca. Later, Parame\u015bwara was escorted by Zheng He and other envoys in his successful visits. Malacca's relationships with Ming China granted it protection from attacks by Siam and Majapahit. Malacca officially submitted to Ming China as a protectorate. This encouraged the development of Malacca into a major trade settlement on the trade route between China and India, Middle East, Africa and Europe.According to a popular legend, Parameswara was resting under a tree near a river during a hunt, when one of his dogs cornered a mouse deer. In self-defence, the mouse deer pushed the dog into the river. Impressed by the courage of the deer, and taking it as a propitious omen of the weak overcoming the powerful, Parameswara decided then and there to found an empire on that very spot. He named it 'Malacca' after the tree where he had just taken shelter at, the Malacca tree (Malay: Pokok Melaka).Winstedt suggested that the mouse deer story is likely a story modified from a folk-tale from Kandy, Sri Lanka. And more recently, Ahmat Adam pointed out the another possible source of the mouse deer story in his recent romanization work on Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai. Since the founding of Kandy and Pasai predate Melaka, it is not unsafe to conclude that the Melaka version of mouse deer is borrowed and adapted from them.\nIn collaboration with allies from the sea-people (orang laut), the wandering proto-Malay privateers of the Straits, he established Malacca as an international port by compelling passing ships to call there, and establishing fair and reliable facilities for warehousing and trade.\n\nIn Malacca during the early 15th century, Ming China actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for their treasure voyages into the Indian Ocean. Malacca had been a relatively insignificant region, not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both Ma Huan and Fei Xin, and was a vassal region of Siam. In 1405, the Ming court dispatched Admiral Zheng He with a stone tablet enfeoffing the Western Mountain of Malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country. The Chinese also established a government depot (\u5b98\u5ee0) as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers. Ma Huan reported that Siam did not dare to invade Malacca thereafter. The rulers of Malacca, such as Parameswara in 1411, would pay tribute to the Chinese emperor in person. In 1431, when a Malaccan representative complained that Siam was obstructing tribute missions to the Ming court, the Xuande Emperor dispatched Zheng He carrying a threatening message for the Siamese king saying \"You, king should respect my orders, develop good relations with your neighbours, examine and instruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or aggressively.\" The early kings of Malacca\u2014Parameswara, Megat Iskandar Shah, and Sri Maharaja\u2014understood that they could gain Ming China's protection through skillful diplomacy and thereby could establish a strong foundation to their kingdom against Siam and other potential enemies. Chinese involvement was crucial for Malacca to grow into a key alternative to other important and established ports.To enhance relations, Hang Li Po, according to local folklore, a daughter of the Ming Emperor of China, arrived in Malacca, accompanied by 500 attendants, to marry Sultan Manshur Shah who reigned from 1456 until 1477. Her attendants married locals and settled mostly in Bukit Cina.\n\n\"In the 9th month of the year 1481 envoys arrived with the [......] Malacca again sent envoys to China in 1481 to inform the Chinese that, while Malaccan envoys were returning to Malacca from China in 1469, the Vietnamese attacked the Malaccans, killing some of them while castrating the young and enslaving them. The Malaccans reported that Vietnam was in control of Champa and also sought to conquer Malacca, but the Malaccans did not fight back, because they did not want to fight against another state that was a tributary to China without permission from the Chinese. They requested to confront the Vietnamese delegation to China which was in China at the time, but the Chinese informed them since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor sent a letter to the Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also ordered the Malaccans to raise soldiers and fight back with violent force if the Vietnamese attacked them again.\n\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nIn April 1511, Alfonso de Albuquerque set sail from Goa to Malacca with a force of some 1200 men and seventeen or eighteen ships. They conquered the city on 24 August 1511. After seizing the city Afonso de Albuquerque spared the Hindu, Chinese and Burmese inhabitants but had the Muslim inhabitants massacred or sold into slavery.It soon became clear that Portuguese control of Malacca did not also mean they controlled Asian trade centred there. Their Malaccan rule was severely hampered by administrative and economic difficulties. Rather than achieving their ambition of dominating Asian trade, the Portuguese had disrupted the organisation of the network. The centralised port of exchange of Asian wealth had now gone, as was a Malay state to police the Straits of Malacca that made it safe for commercial traffic. Trade was now scattered over a number of ports among bitter warfare in the Straits.\n\nThe Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier spent several months in Malacca in 1545, 1546, and 1549. The Dutch launched several attacks on the Portuguese colony during the first four decades of the seventeenth century. The first attack took place in 1606 under the command of Dutch Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge who laid siege to the town with the help of his Johor allies. He engaged the Portuguese armada which had been sent from Goa to offer armed relief to the besieged port. On 14 January 1641, the Dutch defeated the Portuguese in an effort to capture Malacca, with the help of the Sultan of Johor. The Dutch ruled Malacca from 1641 to 1798 but they were not interested in developing it as a trading centre, placing greater importance on Batavia (Jakarta) and Java as their administrative centre. However they still built their landmark, better known as the Stadthuys. In the Dutch era the building was white, the red paint is of later date.\n\nMalacca was ceded to the British in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 in exchange for Bencoolen on Sumatra. From 1824 to 1942, Malacca was under the rule of the British, first by the British East India Company and then as a crown colony. Due to dissatisfaction with British jurisdiction over Naning, Dol Said, a local chief, fought the East India Company in a war from 1831 to 1832, which resulted in a decisive British victory. It formed part of the Straits Settlements, together with Singapore and Penang. Malacca went briefly under the rule of Empire of Japan in 1942\u20131945 during World War II.\n\n\n=== Post colonial era ===\nAfter the dissolution of this crown colony, Malacca and Penang became part of the Malayan Union on 1 April 1946, which later became the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948. The declaration of independence was made by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, at Padang Pahlawan on 20 February 1956, which eventually led to the independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957. On 16 September 1963, Malaysia was formed with the merger of Malaya with Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore, and Malacca became part of it. On 15 April 1989, Malacca was declared a historical city. It was then also listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 7 July 2008.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe state of Malacca covers an area of 1,664 km2 (642 sq mi).

          "We did the 6.45pm cruise and it was a great way to finish the day. The lights along side the river were just coming on so it made it very photogenic. It is a good day way to get a different view of the city especially when you have been walking around along the river side.",
          "A cruise of about 45 minutes. I cannot speak as to value because it was prepaid as part of our package and do not know the cost. The narration was by our Tour Manager so I cannot speak for the norm in that respect either. An enjoyable cruise through the regenerated parts of the",

          "Recommend to take the night cruise to see the whole stretch of river lighted-up. It's cooler at night also. We had a good time. Kid was totally fascinated with the rainbow lighting and counting boats. I enjoyed seeing the artworks and people watching along the way. We could also",
          "We enjoyed a night cruise along the river at 8.30pm. There were pretty lights the length of the river, on both sides, which made for entertaining viewing. The murals on the buildings were also illuminated. My husband and I felt that the tour would not be nearly so appealing in",
          "At first, I'm confused with the queue to get the ticket and the queue to board the boat. The lines are not \"travelers\" friendly. It's pandemonium as the \"beca\" sound system had silent the call from the RELA in charge of the lines. We had queue wrongly as the line is designated",

          "Malacca river cruise is certainly an interesting 45 minutes round trip over the Sungai Melacca river. The cruise boat passes through China Town, Kampung Morten, many other places of the city. One can take it during the day or at night. A Grab rider suggested me to take it at",

          "Me and my friend decided to do the river cruise and we loved it. My favourite part was seeing the beautiful buildings that look lost in time. Also we see lots of lizards in the water. I would 100% do it again but next time at night. Overall a great experience and I would say you",

          "Cruising along 2km long river to watch and learn the historic story of Melaka. First before you get on the boat, we have to buy ticket. (Price on my pic) Cruising both day and night are fascinating. First lap they let you to learn the scene, taking pic and see the sign. Next",
          "The kids had a nice time and the scenery at night is quite nice. The audio was difficult to hear but included some good history on the area. Nice way to see the river area from the water. Worth the time and money.",
          "A very nice cruise, especially with all the lights at night. It is also a way of enjoying some sightseeing as the cruises passes near old nicely decorated old houses and historical places such as Dutch Square.",
          "Organised and cozy, the boat trip gives you a helpful overview of the town while providing you with useful information about the history of the place. It is highly recommended especially if you have only a few hours to spend at the city.",

          "Colleagues from Germany thought that the city was charming. Of course, I do as well. We stayed the night at Hatten Hotel (good breakfast buffet and clean rooms). We covered the usual tourist spots which was easy as we are able to grab a little tour book guide from our hotel",
          "Our friends recommended catching the boat at about 7pm - that way we went up river during the daylight and came down as the sun was setting and the lights came on - two trips for the price of one! Useful to know! Talking of the price, we bought our tickets at the bridge by",

          "We started our boat tour from the 'tall ship' end of the river near the maritime museum, many of the old buildings have been covered in street art making the trip quite interesting. The boat driver stopped for everyone to watch a huge monitor lizard in the water. The return trip",
          "Have been to Malacca several times bur this was the first time taking the river cruise. This was the final piece of the jigsaw as you see how everything interconnects. The street art is superb and can be seen vividly from the cruise.",
          "Superb experience exploring the Malacca's river. With audio guidance explaining the exact moment when passing to certain historical places. It took 30-40 minutes slowly cruising the river. A must try for local and foreign tourists.",
          "The normal type of tourist river boat trip that is available in many places around the World, but still a pleasant way to waste an hour on a very hot day and feel some breeze. Saw plenty of Monitor Lizards too.",

          "Took the 45min cruise. Enjoyable. Great scenes along the way. There are many boarding and disembarking points. We boarded at the Kampong Morten jetty and alighted at The Shore jetty. We took many photos. After we alighted at The Shore, we went to visit the shopping mall. After",

          "This approximately 30-minute cruise is relaxing, entertaining and pleasant. Go for it after dark to view the delightful lights hanging from trees and railings, spot lights on trees and several bridges as well as light shows on bridges. In Asia, it is a brilliant idea and",

          "Both of us able to cruise Melaka River during night time. It was a great moment. The bestbtime toncruise is night time. You gonna see lots of colorful lights along the river while crusing. Old buildings which being refurbished and lots of great mural on the walls that makes",

          "A leisurely way to see the interesting spots along Melaka River. They are nicely lit and made me want to come back in the day time to check the spots out more. Seniors and students get a discount. Staff are friendly and helpful.",

          "We got on near the estuary into the Melaka straits. Perfectly comfortable tourist boat which simply goes upriver and back. Sadly the upstream leg was devoid of any commentary, which was played on the return leg. This was recorded in Malay and English, and not always in sync with",
          "If you are in Melaka or intend to go there by all mean take the river cruise. if it's your first time then savour the experience. I would recommend to go at night, the scenes are different from the day time with all the lights along the river. If you can't i would recommend",
          "We enjoyed our 45 minute return trip along the river. Tickets were 30RM each, purchased at the on site kiosk and we were able to get aboard a departing boat immediately. I tripped and cut my foot on the walk over and the staff were quick to source the first aid kit for a",

          "This was included as part of a tour that we did. We thoroughly enjoyed it. We did the round trip which was nice as we go to see anything we missed the first time. I imagine this would also be lovely to do at night.",

          "We were marginal on doing this activity as the boats did not look comfortable and we already walked the river front. When we went to buy tickets we were informed that the senior discount was for Malay only, so we opted not to go and think this is a very poor practice and also",

          "We have spent a day in Melaka but feel we could do with two days. It is a lovely place with a lot of history to it and various cultures had an influence on the architecture which is quite evident. The cruise itaself is very good as it shows you back of the streets and has",

          "We did an evening trip having walked along the river during the day and it did give a different perspective. Took just over half an hour with the commentary happening in one direction- as we went towards the sea. We were the only non-Malaysians on the trip which was an issue as",

          "The river cruise was on our list to do before we arrived in Malaysia and it lived up to its billing. On our trip it was a touch noisy because a soap opera was being filmed on board, which was funny if a little distracting. Melaka from the river is very different and this is well",

          "Brought my foreigners friends here for the river cruise . Paid rm13 for myself with mykad and my overseas friends paid rm18 for weekday pricing as for weekend pricing it was slightly higher . This was my 3rd time taking the cruise , compare to my 1st time , the trip has gone",
          "A good way to see the river and the shops and houses next to it. Takes less than 45 mins and doesn\u2019t actually take yih very far. Commentary was keen to tell us how much the government had spent on various projects and not so much on the history. Worth it to see the buildings",
          "This is a 45 mins tour ( to- fro) . This tour covers almost half of the main part of meleka city. This is cost RM 23 per person. You can compare the old architecture and the new melaka architecture during this tour. The best time to board on cruise is around 7 PM ,so that while",
          "Melaka is one of the historical city where great ancient building be excellently protect. Join the river boat is prefer on the night, because we could see beautiful scenery, buildings, lights, and other night attractions. The boat tickets was RM 16 each. Time taken was for about",
          "I have read one or two of the reviews, unsurprisingly the view is of the town, not sure how it could be anything else! The boats are many in number which meant no waiting. It was about 45minutes and was 20rm or thereabouts. We liked it splashing through the bow waves and seeing",
          "Waited a Long time to get on the boat that\u2019s crowded Knee to knee. The commentary was from a recording and difficult to listen from the noise of the motor. Be aware that there\u2019s different price for peak session and foreigner.",
          "This can be considered a should-do in Melaka, as the its river bank houses many of the city's historical sits as well as new developments. We are impressed with how clean the river is kept. The night cruise is interesting as we could see the lights decorating the buildings and",
          "Great experience specially if at 6 PM to allow for some breeze and cooler sun with sunset scenes, great photos and fun time",
          "We took the river cruise in the evening. It was a nice experience enjoying the view of the old shophouses and landmarks along the way. We even spotted a small monitor lizard in the river. However there was no commentary on board. We were also not given any life jacket so",
          "The management should hire staff who can smile with better soft skills. The boat itself was smelly. We had to pay more during school holiday.",
          "Took the river cruise at 6.30 pm. Think it\u2019s better in daylight than night because can see the colorful wall murals on the shop houses lining the river and the kampung Morten and the mangrove swamps. Don\u2019t sit towards the front as the river water splashes up. And the river is",
          "We took the river cruise at night and we think it gives a better experience compare to day cruise. We can see the beautiful colorfull lights decorating the bridge, hotel, coffeeshop and bar. The recorded tour guide is in 2 languages: English and Melayu (Malay) The painting and",
          "We thought it would be a great way to explore the river, but we were very disappointed. The boarding were rude to the point of being aggressive. It was raining when we took our trip we were ok we had waterproofs, the rest of the tourists did not and had a very unpleasant trip,",
          "good activities to do with family members when in Melaka. the ticket is only RM15.00 for local adult and RM10.00 for local children (this is the price on Public Holiday).",
          "Ride was fun. Going around the river with interesting scenery. The crusie was going at a nice pace. Definitely a go to place while in melaka.",
          "Went for this during the afternoon. The wait was a little unpleasant. Though there were ceiling fans, we were soaking wet with our sweat. It was a normal ride entirely. The smell of the river maybe a little unpleasant for some. However, what made it a little spectacular, was",
          "We went for the cruise in the afternoon, it was hot, humid and unpleasant. Still the sights were nice but I believe the night cruise would have been nicer based on what we saw atop a hotel overlooking Kampung Morten with its magniificent lights switched on as well as other icons",
          "Melaka River Cruise is colorful at night as you can see the bridges, malay kampung houses, shops & restaurants along the river are brightly litted with different colors. You can also add dinner package in your cruise. Do not miss the fun of cruising by the Melaka river.",
          "A must-visit-place if you are in Melaka. The fee was reasonable and the ambience was nice. Kids quite enjoying themselves.",
          "So excited to enjoy Melaka with Cruise while we can listen the history of this city. Nice trip with Friends.",
          "Our hotel is just next to the river cruise. I can see the cruise from my hotel room. In a day..i think its quite hot to cruise. We went cruising at night on Friday. The q was long but moving. So its ok with me and the kids. Beautiful sight seeing at night. Lights is everywhere.",
          "30 minutes river cruise along the melaka river with nice view with the mural design at the commercial building along the river",
          "The price rises during holidays. RM15.90 per person. The ride took approximately 30minutes and you can listen to the recorded commentary while enjoying the view along the river.",
          "Really recommended this if you want to see from another perspective. At least you could get the taste of ancient time why this river is important and the scenery along the river bank is attractive. Kids would surely enjoy this cruise as it is not too fast and the ride is smooth.",
          "Friendly staff, informative ride, difference experience and worth for money (RM15.00 with myKad) for adult.. forgot to brought my student card for 50% off discount. I bought the ticket at booth near the bridge (opposite hard rock cafe).. the friendly staff provide me with",
          "Visited few months back while on a working trip. Went on evening and was astounded!! Beautiful clean river with arrays of display of beautiful lighted traditional kampong houses!! Worth it!! Must visit while you are here",
          "We took this cruise on our second day in Melaka, but recommend it for your first day. It gives a lovely overview of many areas of Melaka, and the English / Malay commentary is helpful. Great seeing all the old shopfronts, and the many gorgeous murals on many of them. Sitting",
          "The boats are clean and comfortable. Took the 7:15pm ride where it was a cross from sunset orange view to beautifully lit wall murals and bridges in the night. Some parts of the river were smelly but bearable.",
          "Post Sunset is the perfect time to go for river cruise, with colourful lighting across makes it more beautiful. Definitely a must see and experience",
          "Got a complimentary ticket on our hotel stay. It was a nice experience since you will have a nice tour around the city. Perfect time for this is during sunset for you to see both the murals and the city lights.",
          "The Melaka river cruise is really fun as you will get a chance to sit the boat around Melaka river. The tour onboard the Melaka river cruise was meaningful as they explain to you the history of the places around Melaka river. The boat tour last for about 30 minutes to 40",
          "This cruise is long and has nice views. Unlike the other cruises that only have less than 30 minutes, this one has around 45 to 60 minutes of duration cruising the Melaka River. Ride it in the evening and you will see some colorful lights along the river with the heritage",
          "I tried this on 27/08/2017, around 10pm. You have to pay for this river cruise. We went in a group of students. For Malaysian- student, you can have discounted price for RM7.50, and of course, you have to show them your student ID. Somehow, some foreign colleagues did not manage",
          "We were in two minds as to whether to take the cruise - it is billed as lasting 40/45 minutes. So eventually we decided to take the bot at 6:00pm and got on a well organised and well kept boat seating about 50 people. AND we thoroughly enjoyed this little trip. Lots to see on",
          "We took this cruise late morning and were able to see many wonderful buildings on both sides of the river. Cruising along smooth waters and gliding under beautiful bridges taking in the restored buildings was a good way to see this part of the city..",
          "Melaka River was rehabilitated as a mitigation measure against flood that affects the area. Along with this mitigation, they improved not only the riverbank but also the establishments and houses beside the river. The main attraction of the river cruise is the colorful walls",
          "I would say,it's the best of Melaka.This cruise took us along the Melaka river,showed us around the small Melaka city. After Kl, Langkawi,Penang, this river cruise and relaxation was much-needed. Go after evening, best seen with the night lights.You have to wait in the line",
          "Melaka is lovely, rich in history and character. The best way to enjoy it is along the Melaka River on a river cruise or on the lovely river walk path. Form here you will see Jonkers, Red Square, some of the churches and of course the harbour area. The artwork on the building",
          "Go for the night cruise along Malacca River to catch the beautiful night scenes along the river bank as well as those colourful light reflected on the river wave. Enjoy the excitement n thrills as you cruise on. But, in the meantime, do be aware of sudden splash of stench river",
          "I choose the trip to Melaka to see a little part of Malaysia. The city has not to many to offer; only the graffiti lovers have the chance to see old wet buldings painted in many colours.",
          "We enjoyed it so much we went twice, in the day time and again at night. It goes past many little cafes and lots of interesting murals.",
          "River cruise takes you around some central parts of Melacca. Boats are ok but despite warning signs, they don't make passengers wear life jackets. You get some nice views of the city including some murals and with night lighting it looks nice. Audio tour could have been a lot",
          "We enjoyed very much Melaka river cruise, you can see many historic building along the river and lots of beautiful painting.",
          "A nice way to see Melacca. It lasts 40 mins. We went around 3pm. The boat unfortunately was packed. Everyone seemed to be squeezed in. 40 people on one boat do seem a lot on a hot day. The cruise itself was great. Pass by a few bridges and colourful buildings. No commentary on",
          "I never expect that the 40-minute (RT) Melaka River Cruise will turn into one of my memorable rides. The ticketing and waiting area near the Maritime Museum was not that appealing and (oh you can purchase just one-way ticket.) Anyway, when the cruise started, we passed by",
          "First time trying the river cruise. The price is reasonable, they even have student discount. The whole journey from 1 jetty to another is approximately 40 minutes. Quite boring and be prepared for the awful river smell that smells like a lake.",
          "Went there on 15 July and the place Just ok, not so interesting. The ferry very noisy and can't listen to anything. Other than that the view is nice.",
          "Had a great time going on the river cruise. It was informative and the 'captain' was kind enough to stop at sights long enough for us to take photos especially the big iguana lizards. Full of surprises and had a great time.",
          "The river cruise is a must do in Melaka, since you will be able to see the most of he architecture and the city itself within a single ride. Enjoyed the views all along the joinery. Good experience.",
          "The river is flowing middle through Melaka. Nevertheless there is not much to see on the river cruise. Maybe it is more intersting at night.",
          "Economy price to enjoy boat ride with kids and families even though river not so clean as it's muddy.",
          "Smelly water. Not sure why woukd anyone take this cruise as the water is green and smelly. Not a good way to spend money.",
          "well the cruise is a short boat ride which is good for history buffs the sights are of of old buildings and old settlements along with modern buildings the boat driver does not give you any explanation on the tour and the pre recorded audio commentary is of very poor quality",
          "We experienced the late evening cruise. My kids were excited and had fun. Enjoyed the night view and the wall painting with the colour full lights on the river bank. Good job by the Government and there are more rooms for improvement. Ticket price is also reasonable. Will visit",
          "Can\u2019t say that it was a very exciting experience, but one of the best moments that we\u2019ve experienced in Melaka. Some fresh air, slowly moving but over-packed with the tourists boat\u2026However, the scenery is very enjoyable and we glad that we spend some time on the boat and saw",
          "Good activity for young kids. Nice wall painting with malaysia culture, melaka history and meaningful bridge for memorable person. Can see the kampung morten malay culture village too. The ticket price also reasonable RM10.60 for adult. We take the cruise at the shore hotel",
          "The boat ride last about 45 min, starting from the Maritime Museum and then upstream to the Spice Garden before turning back to the start point. The whole journey is around 5.5km long, passing by several historical buildings, shop houses converted restaurants and cafes,",
          "To see along the Malacca River on this cruise lasting about 40 minutes are sites such as the big water-wheel, the small fort-like structure called Middleburg Bastion with cannons sticking out from above, the famous Dutch Square and the cathedral-like Church of St. Francis",
          "I think it would have been more interesting to have gone for the cruise in the evening when lights are all turned on since the river cruise brings you along the \"backbone\" of Melaka. Most of the sights and buildings were seen from the back area. There were some interesting",
          "It is clear that the Malacca State Council wanted to make the river an attraction, but poor service and lazy attitude might just be its downfall. The whole cruise is interesting, It is a good ride on the river. Can have an overview of all the sights before walking on foot later",
          "We went there during night on weekdays. So the queue is very short and not crowded. We also can park our car very close to the jetty. I recommend to all to experience the cruise during night so you can see lighting effect to the historical building along the river and Malacca",
          "Although it wAs a 2 hour from KL ride it was worth it . Our teksi / taxi driver offered to drive us to and from Melaka for RM500. We did our river cruise late afternoon as it was a very humid and warm day . Clean river , houses, hostels ,bars and restos line up along its banks.",
          "The cruise was good . It was a beautiful sight to go by night. The govt. has done an excellent job on the upkeep of the river. Going under the bridges and seeing the names lit up was beautiful. On the way back , the announcement could hardly be heard with all the tourist",
          "It's only RM 10 for Malaysian, and you get to see Melaka in a different way. Elegantly sitting down and the cruise will bring you to see the beautiful river bank, the painting and the cafe. I come at 6.30pm so get to see both the day view and night view. Its comfortable and",
          "This is a starting point to take a ticket to start the river tour on Melaka River. The trip will be much interesting at morning. Cool environment and tourists are still not too crowded along the river. It's a special experience",
          "Maybe went during weekend, so pack of peoples. The boat we take was with family a bit noisy and can't really heard the uncle try to explain to us . However, it's quite a fun ride .",
          "We decided to take the river cruise since it was very near our hotel. The walk along the river to the jetty was pleasant. The cruise itself was nothing too fancy. There was a recorded commentary during the course of the cruise. Something the kids would enjoy just for a leisurely",
          "It's great to be visiting Melaka River Cruise, cruising along the river at night, watching all the Kg Morten houses fill with light, seeing the painting. But, it kind of dull with the small spaces on the boat, the boat driver hard to attract the participant keep on doing noise.",
          "We have been to Melaka many rounds and we always focus at the tourist spots visit by car or foot. This round we decided to explore the river cruise along Malacca River and it turns up to be a very exciting trip for us including the young children. This is an interesting way to",
          "We went cruise with family and my 3 years old daughter. It is good to explore famous Melaka River Walk without walking especially for old peoples. My daughter enjoy so much and environment is really fantastic.",
          "Well, it is pretty cool to experience Melaka by boat in such humid days. The boat trip is every 30 mins. The best time to get on boat for taking photos or videos is at 7pm-7:30pm when it is in between day & night time.",
          "Fall in love with Melacca since my first trip in 2014 and there are 3 more trips after that to this beautiful old city. And the most attraction I love most is the night cruise in the river, so romantic and beautiful!",
          "We had the river cruise in the evening. Since we were in a big group, we have to pre-book. It was a pleasant ride. However, I wish the guide was more 'entertaining' in telling us about the history of the place. Along the river, there are a few enjoyable spots with very",
          "Melaka is one of the most beautiful place i've travelled so far...just loved this place with its unique beautiness! We were couples and was having only the plan for river cruising, so we reached around 6pm only...then only we came to know this place offers a lot other than",
          "Nice cruise all the way l, it took around 45 min to complete the round. Price was ok. Child above 2 years old been charge too here. But so far my kids enjoy it.",
          "The trip was awesome and educational, there are option for single or return trip. It is best to go at late evening or night when the weather is much colder and the lights along the river is turned on.",
          "We went in the later afternoon and it was a nice pleasant trip. Lots of bridges and interesting buildings along the river. There was commentary only on the way back and it was done in both English and Malay...didn't add much to the experience.",
          "We'd had tiring morning tramping around Melaka so it was nice to take a relaxing 45-minute boat journey before lunch. We boarded downstream from our hotel, Casa Del Rio, and headed up-river for a couple of kilometres alongside the pedestrian path, passing trendy cafes with",
          "After so many attempt to buy tickets for cruise ride in our previous visits to Melaka, at last we managed to buy the tickets this time. One will experience the cruise for about 9km strolling along Sungai Melaka overlooking the Melaka town. There are many beautiful old",
          "With the benefit of hindsight this back water tourist boat experience goes was vaguely interesting as you floated down the 9km Sungai Melaka River going past Ancient Dutch Building some with amusing graffiti daubed on them & a Malay village, China Town, & Places of worship.",
          "We went on weekday, so got cheaper price: RM 15,9/pax for foreigners, and not too crowded. The journey took about 40 minutes. The Malacca river is clean, no solid rubbish seen along the track. We saw beautiful wall paintings along the way. Hipster cafes, the preserved kampong",
          "Trip takes about 45 minutes to go up and down the river. Extremely cheap ( about $5 Australian ). Boats probably not that well maintained, with a big gash in the side of the one I was on, but did not feel unsafe. We had music on the way up and then some commentary ( recorded",
          "This river cruise takes you round the city of Melaka. It was quite enjoyable, since the surroundings were well maintained for the viewers of the cruise.",
          "We took this river cruise about 4 pm friday. Didn't have to wait too long as it wasn't a weekend. We boarded a 40-seater boat..the ride was nice along the curvy river. It took a half of an hour return trip. The river is clean, smelly a bit at a short stretch. As the boat moved",
          "Fun ride, there's a introduction audio through out the cruise. River water splashing to our face once a while. I personally felt the price is abit high for MyCard holder, RM15.90. Probably RM10 will be ok? Anyway, enjoyed it!",
          "I and and friends visit Melaka River on November 2016. The river are very clean. We like the riverside, green and the buildings so colourful.",
          "For a reasonable price 1590 pp we had a good sight of the back of the houses with their beautiful paint/art work.We had to go one way,than turned around,before the comment started.Very educational and worth doing.",
          "Cruise is affordable and a good way to sight-see without having to walk a lot. However, the queue can be very long on weekends and holidays. To avoid the crowd, be there at 9am to buy the ticket and wait for the cruise to start around 9.45am. Will personally recommend the cruise",
          "We went to the Melaka River Cruise on a Thursday evening. It was a great weather. We waited about 15 minutes for the boat to arrive. We paid RM 10 for adults (warganegara) and RM 5 for kids (warganegara) Wherelese for foreigners, RM 15 for Adults and RM 7 for kids. It was about",
          "The whole state of Malacca can be described as the title.. This is the perfect spot for couples to have a short brief planning on how to see Malacca in a whole. There are 3 point to start the river cruise: - Taman Rempah (Food court) - Pirate Park (A fun fair) - Muzium Kastam",
          "Nice local river cruise in town...You can see all the traditional and historical building located along Malacca's river like Morten Village, Samudera Museum, Taming Sari Tower and many more...The cruise started in Spice Garden and will end at the Malacca's river mouth...I",
          "Well worth the price, a delightful way to see Malacca, just the right length of time and lots of fun. If you sit near the back the fumes from the engine are a little unpleasant, but the ride was fun.",
          "We were surprised just how far we ventured in land on the cruise, there was over 9 kilometers, we passed many older areas that seemed uninhabited - I guess an evening cruise would show more activity at the rivers edge perhaps. It seemed that many parts of the city are vacant -",
          "We took the river cruise from the jetty close Taman Rempah i suppose. way less crowded than the Stadthuys jetty area. Price was reasonable for us the whole family (grandparents till grandchildren). We cruise on the river at night and it was really nice to see the river stretch",
          "Visited with family, and we tried the evening one previously, so we tried to take the cruise at night this time. Think we prefer the night view more. So I guess, it would be best to take the cruise during evening sunset time! The price is expensive! There's different pricing",
          "This is one artistic River cruise that you should not missed\ud83d\ude0d. You get to see different structural bridges and wall painting during the entire river ride. Not to mention the unique difference of the kampong and modern housing. In the late afternoon or even in the morning when",
          "Nice view for both day or night trip at very readonable price. You can see many beautiful mural by locals and historical cinema. The trip is about 15 minutes. They will take your picture before departure. Try this if you want your picture printed on paper and magnet..it could be",
          "Worth it. Better than Menara Taming Sari. Around 35minutes from start to finish. The narration a bit hard to be heard. And be prepared to be wet if you sit infront.",
          "I highly recommend the Melaka River Cruise for an ultimate cultural immersion in Melaka. By trying this, you'll get to see the riverside old buildings, residences, hotels and restaurants. You will also have fun watching other tourists and locals. The best time to experience the",
          "For me, the price paid for this river cruise is not really worth the experience. Nothing much to see along the river since the tour is quite short. For better experience, I think it is better to talk a walk along the riverside. U can stop and take a lot of good pictures rather",
          "The river cruise is like any other you have done to be honest it's better at night and cheaper in the week as they charge a higher fee if your foreigner and no one can tell you why that was the same at the Zoo bird farm ect.",
          "The cruise takes about 45 minutes. It cost 23R. Once you buy your ticket, you line up. Hopefully you are not the first in line & have to wait for enough other people to arrive to fill the boat. We only waited a few minutes. The commentary on board was quite good & quite",
          "If you have a choice, take the evening cruise as the night view makes a lot of difference. a lovely 45 minute ride. Only hiccup is that the audio explanation of the place is horrible...sound system is out and not clear",
          "We got there at 9am and ticket counter was already open and sold a ticket with no mention of boats not starting yet. Went over to get the boat and told to come back at 10, maybe 10.30. Would have appreciated a heads up at the ticket counter. Came back at 10.15 to see a huge line",
          "When we visited the price for foreigners were 21ringgits. Almost 3 times what locals pay. The cruise is a 30minute round trip of a riverside which you can actually walk. There are nice walkways either side of the river and it was shaded during the day and cool at night.",
          "Typical river cruise style - showcasing the entire little historical town of Melaka. Dont miss the murals on the walls & the mock-village views. Just long enough not to be bored!",
          "Driving around Melaka, it seemed to us another historic town with the buildings and shops etc. However, we were surprised to realise that a lot of the shops had a very nice back alley by the river which we wouldn't have realised if not for this cruise!",
          "I should start by saying we were there on a very busy (deepavali) weekend. The boats were all full and the organisation at the queue (actually what queue?) was abysmal. People pushing in, boats not arriving when they should, not fun. We went back in the pm and the crowds were",
          "A number one top and a must-do in Melaka, i felt like it must be a different part of the world which full of heritage, as the boat goes by the Melaka River, it felt like we were going down memory lane..the kids had so much fun to! Boat, water bliss,old buildings,heritage marks,",
          "Take a morning stroll along the riverbank not only you achieved your 10,000steps but you get to enjoy the wall art along the river and alleys. Come back in the night to enjoy the fantastic lighting effects along the river. The fee for the boat ride is about MYR 10 if i not",
          "Iam in love with Melaka..seriously. Okay..it comes second after Kl! The river cruise..ah..definitely worth trying. It was a breeze for us as the pick up point (where the cruise starts) was within walking distance of our hotel..The Majestic. We just walked right over,paid for our",
          "I had river cruises in other countries but I only find this unique and different since I saw on the river big komodo dragons freely swam on the river. The boat trip is not that long and at day time most of the stores,cafe and restaurants beside the river where closed.My guide",
          "Nice view. You can see malacca trough the river road. My children like this boat. But unfortunately the melaka photographer insist to take out photo for purpose of sale",
          "My friend and I had a really lovely time on the river cruise and we would definitely recommend it whilst holidaying in Melaka. It was our favourite experience over the weekend. We went on the boat during the day, as we wanted to see the street art in the daylight. I imagine it",
          "The price of the ticket for Malaysian's have increased to RM 16.++/ per person which makes me feel that its not worth the ride unless this is your first time to Melaka or have nothing else to do. I brought my friends whose first trip to Melaka, hence we went for a ride on it.",
          "we took the cruise at late evening so the breeze was perfect. many restaurants were opening thier dinner tables with customers along the river, a wonderful sight and nice environment.",
          "the cruise is so good we decided to do it during the day and again at night and it is a MUST-DO on arrival as you can then see where to go back to do more intense sightseeing. informative and romantic at the same time is possible .... the frequency of the boats make that the",

          "My family and I were there for holiday. It was very very crowded. After waiting in a long queue, we bought 3 tickets, Rm 7 for children and citizens and Rm 21 for tourists. And we stood in an another long queue for entering the cruise. There was not any area for seating, and it",
          "Initially we did not plan to take the river cruise as we did not expect to see much from it. However, we decided to take the cruise one afternoon after having replenished our energies over a bowl of delicious cendol. The Malacca River Cruise, is indeed, one very pleasant",
          "It is a nice scenery view during the evening with the river cruise. Good discount and free give for the senior citizen. Visiting a Friday evening is better as the crowd is not as much as the weekend.",
          "We tried to buy tickets at a jetty near our hotel, Swiss Garden but was told that all the boats were full and advised to buy the tickets at Taman Rempah. We then drove to Taman Rempah and managed to buy the tickets there. We didn't have to wait for very long for our turn to",
          "A great way to enjoy history and view of Melaka. Best taken at night, its cooler and the lights from the buildings and bridges really comes to life.",
          "If you are expecting this to be like a River Seine Cruise in Paris, don't. It is Malaysia, so don't get your expectations too high up. The last I had visited this city was back in 2003 and I dare say that things have changed, for the better. Considering its progress since, this",
          "Took the cruise with my wife and nephew on the 15th Sep. Started at about 5.20pm. The view from the boat was nice but was overcomed by the smell of the river, if only they could do something about the stench. The wall paintings on the back of the buildings and shops were",
          "Comparing with Singapore river cruise, melaka river cruise is cheaper. It is advised to come in the evening. The light along the river add the artistic of melaka river. It is very romantic. The lack of this view is only the smelly from the river.",
          "Seeing a city from a waterway is always nice. The recording was hard to decipher though. If you can, go on the cruise on a weekday as it\u2019s less expensive.",
          "This river cruise is a return trip cruise whereby if you want to stop at any stop in between, you have to ask the skipper and you can't take the boat ride back to your departing pier afterwards. Nothing much to see and the commentary is a very short one. We heard it in Bahasa",
          "We took a night cruise and the view was superb. But the river had this unpleasant smell. And we sat in the front row and the water splashed onto us. Which gives a total unpleasant experience for this trip.",
          "There are a number of boats going up and down the river. The whole trip takes about 40 minutes and there are plenty of opportunities for photos - from the huge monitor lizards to wonderful old buildings. Prices are much less midweek and there are less people about so that is the",
          "Boats run frequently all day long, night cruise gives different perspectives. Boarding and disembarking point in rather far awayinconvenient location. River is somewhat smelly and greenish.",
          "It was a good experience to ride the river cruise while listening to its history. The ample time they provided will give you quite a moment to appreciate things around you.",
          "This is my third time here & I recommend you to do both the day trip & night trip as it serves different views to you. Night trip is beautifully portrayed throughout the riverside of lights from the Kampung Morten & other buildings. It is much calmer & windy at night rather than",
          "The cruise at night is quite pretty with all the lights in the buildings. You do pass a few historic sights on the river banks and many of the buildings have colorful murals painted on them which are lighted up. You pass under quite a number of bridges on the way. The downside",
          "Enjoyed a great 45 minutes' night cruise of the Malacca River with fantastic night scenes for RM 15 per person for foreigners. We decided on the night cruise as it was much cooler and we were better able to appreciate the sights of everything all lit up. The cruise boat went",
          "Rm10.60 for each adult with mycard(Malaysian only ).No life jacket were provided.But,the boat was flat n safe. So no worry. The view was pretty with rural beside the river. The water was splashy if you sit 2-3seats in front.....So prepare jacket.Haha.",
          "The river cruise was a great experience as you were able to see the old and the new buildings along the river, from heritage buildings to the newest and modern high rises, the old apartments with the art decor and graffiti art painted on the outside and the open air restaurants",
          "I \u2764 Melaka its envaded by Holand.Great History surely we will educate for more interesting Story of this Place. According to the Travell report morethan 14Millions tourist visited the Melaka, Malaysia. Many thing to do . I WILL TELL THAT b4 you visit you need to be book a hotel",
          "The cruise is full of the description of Melaka and also Melaka history...We took a morning cruise [10am] and the cruise finish at approximately an hour later... Tips: The night cruise is better, due to the lighting along the riverside",
          "It was a good half hour cruise. The commentary was disappointing as I could not figure anything out what I was seeing.",
          "It is better to walk along the river side rather than taking the boat ride. However, you can get off whenever there's a small jetty. But once you get off and if you wanna ride on again, you have to purchase the ticket again as the tickets sold are two ways ride. Don't expect",
          "We went to the Melaka River Cruise quite a few years ago. That was excellent with nice on board commentary along the river, hist2and historical buildings, sites, events. The nigh lights along the river was very nice. However, we went again last night, the standard has",
          "I enjoying a cruise alongside Melaka River in a very cozy environment. Nice gravity painting view, but expensive 21.2 Ringgit.for go and back 30 minutes.Its should be 45 minutes.",
          "The views of the river are nice, but unfortunately there's not much to see here. The commentary is in English and Malay, but that is fairly bland. Good to do if you have nothing else. Probably something to do if you can't be bothered to walk down the river yourself. A few murals",
          "If you decide you want to do the river cruise then I highly recommend doing the cruise by night as you see some picturesque sights along the illuminated river (prepare to get snap happy with your camera!) and it also feels much more cooler during the evening with a gentle",
          "We arrived quite early as everything seems to get very busy as the day goes on...went The boats leave every half hour. Tickets were around $20 Australian. All the seats are under a shade cloth and we found that sitting in the middle seats facing out was good. The riverside was a",
          "Pretty little river with stunning artwork in the riverside buildings. Relaxing thing to do. The cruise plays music on the outward journey then gives a little bit of a history tour coming back in. The river water is dirty and smells a little but didn't ruin the fun for me.",
          "A nice quiet river cruise through the Malacca river going through the different bridges and seeing the old and classic houses along the river.",
          "It's a really nice restful ride there is a prerecorded commentary both in Malay and English I was impressed how well maintained the river area is beautifully kept houses and shops reminded me of an Asian Venice worth every rupiah",
          "It is a 40 minute boat ride upriver and back. The cruise follows several twists and turns of the narrow river which is lined with walkways, restored shophouses and kampongs (villages), and some more modern hotels and restaurants. You pass under a number of low bridges and there",
          "Well I went after many suggested .. If it's ur first time to Melaka .. Go for it .. It's cozy and u get to see Melaka .. The second time prefer to chill side by the river with a drink .. Some places are smelly.. Que for the cruise is lengthy .. And cost ,,",
          "When in Melaka do not miss the River Cruise as it will take you along the Melaka River and you will be able to see the beautiful scenic sights along the river banks. Not only that, you would be able to see old buildings turned into F & B outlets for locals and tourists to hang",
          "It was very embarrassing when I brought my Australian friends on the river cruise. The river was so smelly that we all nearly threw-up on the boat. As tourists we pay a much higher price to the locals but unless they can clean up their act than I don't think it is worth the",
          "You must take the ride on the river. It will give you a better look around this city. Also, you can get off and walk around the river walk.",
          "The river cruise is nice especially near late evening.The view is nice when day turn to night. But the river is a bit smelly.",
          "My family enjoyed this 45min ride with nice breeze and get to see malacca most historic and picturesque side.",
          "UNESCO have apparently thrown money at the River Restoration...and what a great way to see it. From our Hotel on the river, the River Cruises were generally packed, all day and well into the evening. Foreigners..2 Adults 42.40RM...or $7-50AUD per person for about 35 minutes all",
          "We wanted to experience the ride as I heard nice view of arts along the river. The water was smelly & did see rubbish floating on the river. When every time another boat pass by we get wet.The ride is short about 30 minutes for the amount of money we paid.",
          "The river cruise was supposed to take 45 mins but ours finished after 32 minutes. We were the only ones on boat. Cost was 15.90 myr (mon-thurs) but increases to 21 myr other days. I guess it was ok, however if you like walking you can walk all the way along the boardwalk and",
          "My husband and I paid 15 Rm for trip which lasts about 45 mins. Not sure how often they run, crew seem to wait until there were a few customers waiting. There was a pre recorded commentary on the way back which was interesting. We went late afternoon and stayed after to have",
          "A group of us went on the Melaka River Cruise which is located in the heart of the Historic City of Melaka. The River Cruise takes about 30 minutes for a return trip and along the way we are able to have a glimpse of the colorful painted Buildings on the river banks. A good",
          "We were enjoying a cruise alongside Melaka river in a very cozy environment. Nice view and overall it's a nice experience, but not too spectacular..",
          "We were recommended to take this cruise seven pm since you could both see the river and the attraction along it both in day and dusk light. Nothing very special. It took approximately 35 minutes in a very slow pace. Safe to skip.",
          "We visited Melaka on public holiday. The city was crazy busy with crowds everywhere. River cruise was relaxing and scenic escape which we enjoyed. Highly recommended.",
          "good way to see Melaka via the river. Try catch the boat ride around 645-7pm or some 15-20 min available sun light left for the day. You get both day light and that 'magical' blue-light sky revered by photographers",
          "We took a river cruise that started around 12.30PM,The boat was half filled,That day was week days but I heard weekend this almost full every trip.we bought the ticket with RM 60 for three person,I would say it is worth for one hour ride. The speed of the ride was quite OK.I",
          "The cruise is simple that it's a trip down the river and back but the street art and interesting buildings and cafe s plus the flowers lining both sides of the river make it very interesting and enjoyable. A good way of discovering the town and then you can go and explore",
          "After spending my day in vising the heritage sites , museums,and forts , palaces, I decided to ve a relaxing evening break to give my feet a rest..so I headed to Melaka River Cruise Pier boarded boat for 23RM..the boat strolled along the river side , it's really N enjoyable ride",
          "It was a pleasant experience. We took the river cruise on three different occasions. We were lucky to find a monitor lizard on the river side. Overall good experience, sometimes due to the wind the water gets foul smell.",
          "The cruise has a lot of potential and could be quite pleasant but a few things detract from an otherwise quaint easy-going experience. I will speak only of my own experience, as others seemed to have a good time. Our boat ran very close to the 40 person capacity, and we were",
          "The advertised trip length of 45 minutes may apply at weekends and on busy days. Normally, it's a pleasant 30-minute long boat ride up and down the handsomely renovated Melaka River. Part of the way it's flanked by the elevated structure of the very short-lived monorail project",
          "Definitely worth doing this short cruise. You get a good look at some of the different areas Melaka has to offer and if it's working, an interesting commentary. Took the cruise around dusk so pretty to see lots of twinkling lights on our return. Keep your eyes open for the big",
          "Another sunny day but thank god it wasn't too hot due to the tropical climate in Malaysia \ud83d\ude05 just be sure to always keep an eye on your toddlers, as they can fall into the river lol. Anyway the cruise is full of beautiful riverside views with most of the buildings built during",
          "I never tire of seeing Melaka from this view point, from the river that once was the lifeblood of Melaka, the motorway from the farms down to where the ships bound for Europe were docked. Through the years I've seen the transformation from the stinking waterway lined with",
          "We enjoy cruising along Melaka River while looking at the view on the melaka river bank with audio explanations what we should see and know about. Everything is okay except the bad aroma from the river itself. The government of Melaka and the management of the river cruise",
          "We went during sunset at 7pm..the ride was every half an hour..we get to see experience both day&night.. eventhough a bit boring but it was quite interesting & relaxing.. not too expensive cuz i got student price..cheers!",
          "We do not recommend this river cruise, as the tickets are to expansive and the activity is not that exciting! Walk along the river instead, you will have the same views and a better experience of Melaka!",
          "We found this trip purely by accident. We were on a sky ride and saw it from the air and made our way down to the river to take the trip, it takes about 40 minutes for the round trip. The boats seat approximately 32 people and cost approximately \u00a310 each. There are lots of",
          "Tried this ride late evening and it is definitely worth the money. A relaxing way to view Malacca at night with colourful lights. Overall it was a good ride except for the smell that comes from the water...",
          "Best to walk at night when it is so much cooler. You will find a lot of restaurants along the riverside near to HRC Melaka. Paintings over the walls makes it interesting.",
          "Taking this river cruise is an interesting way to discover this beautiful city and to cool down after visiting the ''colonial'' areas that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage site . The cruise itself is well organised but some improvements are required . The boat we took only",
          "We decided to go it because it would be the easiest way to visit Melaka without having to walk on the streets. It was pleasant, and worth the fee. River is smelly, which is probably the only negative aspect - nothing to do with the tour itself.",
          "This was a pleasant thing to do on a very hot afternoon and it was good to see another side of the city. I must admit that I expected a bit of commentary as the boat wound its way along the river rather than Kenny G's music. I think this was a missed opportunity. I wouldn't",
          "Regular touristy thing and is a good timepass. Lasts about 30 mins, costs 24 MYR (discounts apply for locals) and is a good thing to try in Melaka. Can be avoided if it is too crowded.",
          "A short trip thorough the Malaka canal but a good chance to see the arty houses and general life of the town. If your 60+ then make sure you have ID and ask for the discount. This means you won't get the goodie bag, but it's worth it.. haha! It's sheltered, so ok for the",
          "We were a bit disappointed that there was no commentary, so we did not really know what we were looking at. Rather loud local music played throughout the trip. The boat was packed solid, so no room to take pictures. However it was interesting to see the city from the river.",
          "Nice view during night time. River a bit smelly. Good effort from the Melaka Government. Nice and good ride.",
          "Do not go during peak season (festive or school holiday) as the queue will be extremely long that will lead you to be standing for a very long time. However, the ride was super fun and you would be able to see the beautiful work of architectures around you infused with a",
          "Went for the river cruise with the fam and it was delightful. Everyone was rather excited because for every cruise boat that went pass, everyone will say \"bye!\" It was very cute. Worth the ride.",
          "Last weekend , I have a few friends from states who came down to Singapore and they decided to go for a day trip to Melaka as they want to know more about Malaysia. I strongly introduce Melaka due to it Rich historical background and it awards for UNESCO recognition. Melaka",
          "The total trip will take approximately 45 minutes. Tickets can be purchased at counter which is near Dutch Square. You can also buy ticket at hotel reception (in case you stay at any hotel in Melaka). The river side view is simply nice and arts on the wall of both side increase",
          "We take a ride on the cruise from the port near to Jonker Street and it cost RM15 for local and RM20 for foreigner for week day The cruise last for around 45 minutes. There was no wow factor for the ride.",
          "Wide barges with 4 rows of seats running the full length of the boat cruise up and down the river at pretty regular intervals. If the boats are full, they are pretty cramped. Quite a bit of work is happening along the banks, as tourism drives development further upstream from",
          "Melaka river is very beautiful...Melaka visit without river cruise is not complete..We have enjoyed a lot..Great view of this heritage city from River....we suggest start river cruise at 7:15 So that when you complete river cruise travellers can see the Riverside with lighting",
          "A great way to travel along the river- the shopfronts, bridges and houses at the riverside had a lot of character, and were what I found the most stunning about Melaka. Since a round trip up and down the river is about 40min, t would have been nice if there was a live guide to",
          "in this trip when u buy the tickets hey offer you local made cookies and a juice, its a pleasurable trip seeing all the street art along side the river. Note you can take the boat just on the back of the muzium samudera",
          "We took the river cruise around 7pm in the evening which lasted about 35min and took us through Sungei Melaka. While the river isn't very wide, it winds past mainly shophouses with very interesting artworks that you can see on the banks. The timing was also good because the",

          "The view is spectacular during the day time and splendid at night, when the buildings are lit up. I have to say this is a 'must do' for tourist. Your visit to Melaka is incomplete without being on it. Best to sit at the most front seat but beware...you'll might get soaked up! I",
          "This river cruise lasts around 45 minutes and is a lovely way to relax and enjoy the water. Informative talk as you cruise. Boats leave very regularly even when only a few on board. We took the trip during the day but the night time one is recommended by locals. Lovely way to",
          "We had gone to Melaka with great expectation from the river cruise. We had to wait for sufficient passengers to gather before we set off. The cruise was about 45 minutes long. Sad to say that there was no live commentary. There was a recorded commentary, and that too came on",

          "There's no queue as we are just opposite \"The Pines\" Hotel. Tickets can be purchased on the hotel concierge counter. The boat itself is poorly designed. Dirty. We've just stand on the aft beside the skipper. Then,we are \"speeding\" to murky Melaka river water, not \"cruising\". For",
          "The river cruise took about 45 minutes and I was beginning to get a little bored within 20 minutes itself. It's a bit too long. There were some nice buildings to see but no clear explanation given (there seemed to be some recorded voice but nothing clear). It should have been",

          "Highly recommend doing the cruise right on dusk around 7pm. You get to see the first half of the trip with daylight and the return leg with all the lights of the bridges and building coming into effect being that little bit darker. We sat at the very front of the boat so be",
          "We've been on the river cruise before, during the day time. This was a couple of years ago. Back then, I would consider the river cruise as one of the 'must see' attractions in Melaka. The boat 'cruised' on the river accompanied by a pre-recorded narration of the buildings,",
          "Went for the night cruise as it was not too hot. We can see all the old houses with nice lighting on the buildings. The night cruise is nice bexause you can only see the lightings at night. It was a great experience as we move along the river in the old town of Melaka.",
          "Nice place, nice view.. Even i did not drive the boat but. We can still enjoy cause melaka river give the best view especially in the night, very romantic",
          "When one purchases the river cruise tickets, one receives drinks + snacks but the cruise isn't all that great except for when one passes the colorful murals, which is the only highlight in my opinion. There will be a voice over explaining what one is seeing (in English and",
          "Malacca river is the biggest highlight of Malacca. The river cruise, approximately 30 mins long, is a very special attraction and is completely worth the money you pay for the ticket. The ticket/waiting queue is generally long, so keep some good time in hand. Good for the",
          "First, r u the type of person who like a long queue or waiting? Second, r u limited on budget? Third, do you want to enjoy the view? Personally, I would recommend to just walk along the river. It is much much better because you can enjoy the view and be more chill, even you can",
          "The queue was long, after we bought the tickets we joined the queue to enter the boat. Despite our unwillingness to take a photo which was always going to be overpriced to buy and we didn't want to waste our time, we were treated unpolitely and forced to take a photo. The boat",

          "This cruise will take you back to the various historical landmarks as you cruise along the river banks. The commentary given as you go along is very comphrehensive in details. Also the cruise is very considerate as it gives priority boarding to those with children. Go during the",
          "The guide was played on from a recording, was difficult to hear at times. We waited for 15 mins before we manage to board the riverboat. It was terrible as the weather was hot and the poly-carbonate roof definitely didn't help with the heat. Seats were designed to cramp as many",
          "We bought the tickets and have been in the line for more than thirty minutes. The waiting is fine but it's a bit exasperating when there are almost twenty idle water taxis with no drivers. Its a long Christmas weekend. Operator should be more prepared to meet the demand of the",
          "This is the second and last time I would take this cruise. Both times, the river was smelly and when the water splashed on us, we would stink too. Had to buy anti bacterial soap on way back. Overrated and over-priced. It would have been good for the narration to make more",
          "A nice way to end our short visit to Melaka, hop on this boat and see the city through the canal. Audio narration is satisfactory, but the ride itself was rather short might as well enjoy the surrounding. Good thing the river is clean & almost no unpleasant smell",
          "Due to weather of Melaka is very hot in Afternoon. Me and my family are sweating while we in the cruise! I would feel that night cruise will be better! There will have lighting along the river!",
          "must try! it was a good experience that i could see melaka from river. it was shorter than i expected but i enjoyed to see scenery along the river. it was on daytime, i would try night cruise upon my next visit.",
          "We went at 12pm and expected a hot cruise. Luckily the cloudy weather helped and we had a pleasant trip. Morning cruise allowed us to view the mural art clearly along the river. Would try night cruise in future to experience the lighting ambient.",
          "The Melaka River Cruise is a value packed and potentially romantic cruise around the river canal that snakes through the old part of Melaka. Its fascinating and educational and gives an idea of this historic old town and all that has gone on there. It takes in the old and the",

          "Taking a trip on the river is popular, pleasant and reasonable value for money but is is a short trip. We took a 'cruise' but it was not a highlight of our visit.",
          "The river cruise is a must try in Malacca. It is comparably cheaper than rickshaw (too short a distance yet higher the price), and if you are local you can get the ticket at a discounted price. The ticket comes with bottles of water and biscuits. Along the cruise there are video",
          "A very nice way to tour the riverside. I recommend the night cruise as there were a lot of nice lights lit at the mangrove trees. They provide an introduction audio clip which explains the history sights along the way in English and BM. Overall it was a very good experience. N",
          "The boat tends to be crowded and the seats are not very comfortable. Although the \"cruise\" was a good way for me to quickly \"tour\" the stretch of Malacca around the river, it provided little learning experience due to the poor sound system that played the introduction audio",
          "After a day of sight seeing, we went for the river cruise in the evening. We had a good seat with an unobstructed view. The boat moved at a good speed where we could feel the evening breeze. Malacca town is indeed interesting from the river. On the way back, there were",
          "Well priced and you receive a bottle of water and snacks to eat on the ride. The coffee snacks were actually really good! The boat ride is a good way to see a different angle of beautiful Melaka and it takes about 40 minutes. Worth the experience if you have the time. The ride",
          "Cruise is a good experience. It does not look like a journey in a river. By travelling in the boot we can enjoy the beauty of the city. The river is getting polluted as the water does not have any flow and effluents are mixing in the water.",
          "The cruise ride was unplanned. We walked pass the ticketing counter along Jonkers Walk after a sumptuous dinner around the corner and decided to take a cruise ride since that ticket costs only RM15.90/pax, including complementary drinks and tit-bits. The cruise ride in the",
          "The cruise itself is nice, it cruised along a stretch of Melaka River that enable you to see few famous landmarks, the introduction is in Bahasa Melayu & English, but engine sound is louder than it, hence need to listen carefully Ticket price vary for weekdays n weekend.",
          "Nice cruise with pre-recorded commentary, some good street art along the way. We did it during the day, I imagine it might be quite pretty in the evening.",
          "This is a good way to work out how the centre of Melaka links. With the river twisting through, I found it a bit confusing to start with. The cruise was OK, but we were told that it would start at 10.30, but the boat didn't arrive until nearer 11. The commentary was limited,",
          "the best time to do the cruise is when and after sunset time. the nice thing is they provide sound guide in the boat, which is very good to give more information about the place.",
          "The cruise up the Melaka River was much more interesting than I anticipated. Many of the shophouses along the banks have been decorated with artworks, some of which is quite whimsical, and there is quite a variety of interesting buildings to see. The vessel was comfortable, but",
          "The river cruise, beside the scenic views of old architectures, it's nice to know that they are also preserving and taking care of the natural wild life that lives in the river. Kudos!",
          "Melaka River is not a very broad water body. So, the manmade features and the decor on either side of the river are clearly visible. The best time to take the ride is during the dusk hour. Almost the entire length of the bank is lit with decorative lights.",
          "Make sure you take a trip at night. The river is a bit dirty but the scenery is great! Must-go whenever you visit Melaka!",
          "This isn't really anything exciting. You cruise very slowly up the river while you take photos of the artwork on the surrounding buildings. There are flowers along the whole way, which are at some points to decorate the footpath and are at other points to distract you from the",

          "I've been in the river cruise almost every time I come to Malacca with visiting family and friends. It's a pleasant trip, but it puts a bad taste in your mouth when you have to pay more as a foreigner, even if you're a Malaysian resident. The tourist phot people are unpleasant",
          "Can't really complain for the 22 ringgit price tag, but a rather average tour. Of course, any tourist who comes to Melaka should experience the boat ride, but it is nothing to shout about. We chose to go on a night cruise having been advised by our hotel staff, but this only",

        "wiki": "The Cheng Hoon Teng Temple (Chinese: \u9752\u4e91\u4ead; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Tshinn-h\u00fbn-t\u00eeng) (also called as the Temple of Green Cloud) is a Chinese temple practising the Three Doctrinal Systems of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism located at No. 25 Jalan Tokong, Malacca City, Malaysia. It is the oldest functioning temple in the country.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe temple site was founded since the era of Dutch Malacca by the Chinese Kapitan of Tay Kie Ki @ Tay Hong Yong in 1645. Additional structures was then constructed in 1673 under the led of Kapitan Li Wei King @ Koon Chang with materials imported from China. The temple served as the main place of worship for the local Hoklo (Hokkien) community. Kapitan Chan Ki Lock construct a main hall for the temple in 1704. In 1801, the temple structures was renovated under the led of Kapitan Chua Su Cheong @ Tok Ping who is the father of Choa Chong Long, the first Kapitan of Singapore, with the addition of additional structures.In 1962, then abbot Seck Kim Seng ordained Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a Zen nun from England and the future founder of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives, at this temple. The temple was awarded a UNESCO award for outstanding architectural restoration in 2003.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe temple is situated close to Jalan Tukang Emas, also known as \"Harmony Street\" because of its proximity to the Kampung Kling Mosque and Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple, covering an area of 4,600 m2. Featuring a magnificent main gate along Jalan Tokong, the temple consists of a complex of several prayer halls with a large main prayer hall dedicated to the goddess of mercy, Guan Yin. Additional smaller prayer quarters were added later. One of these is dedicated to the Buddhist gods of wealth, longevity and propagation, while another houses ancestral tablets. One of the main features of the temple is the seven-metre red flag-pole facing the left wing of the main prayer hall, which houses the remains of two of the three Kapitans who contributed to the construction of the temple. Across the road is a traditional opera theatre which forms a part of the temple complex. The building conforms to the principles of feng shui where the complex is laid out to ensure a view of the river and high ground on either side.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPoh San Teng Temple\nXiang Lin Si Temple\nList of tourist attractions in Malacca\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cheng Hoon Teng Temple at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Bukit China (Malay: \"Chinese Hill\"; Chinese: \u4e09\u5b9d\u5c71) is a hillside of historical significance in the capital of  Malaysian state of Malacca,  Malacca Town. It is located several kilometres to the north from the historical centre of Malacca (Dutch town and Chinatown), but these days, it's surrounded by the modern city on all sides.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to the local tradition, in the mid-15th century, Hang Li Po was sent to be married to the sultan of Malacca, Sultan Mansor Shah, to seal relations between the two countries. The hill, Bukit Cina, a gift from the sultan, was established as their residence. Marine archaeology of a shipwreck (Royal Nanhai wreck from about 1460 AD) suggested royal gifts from China, shipped during Sultan Mansor Shah's reign [1] [2].\nThe Well of Perigi Raja, which is next to the Poh San Teng Temple) (also mistakenly known  as Sam Po Kong Temple) at the foot of the hill (2.1966\u00b0N 102.2562\u00b0E\ufeff / 2.1966; 102.2562), was constructed by Hang Li Po's followers for her personal use but was also an important source of water for much of the town. It was also a prime target for opposition forces, which either poisoned it or tried to hold it for their own use. It was reputed never to have dried up even during droughts. Today, the well has acquired the reputation of a wishing well and it is believed that anyone who throws a coin into the well will return to Malacca.\n\nBukit Cina and two adjoining hills today form a Chinese graveyard covering over 250,000 square metres. With over 12,000 graves, some of which date to the Ming Dynasty, it is said to be the largest Chinese graveyard outside China.\n\n\n== Admiral Zheng He's Seven Dragon Wells ==\n\nAdmiral Zheng He (Cheng Ho)'s Seven Wells lie in the foot of the Bukit China, beside the Poh San Teng Temple. These wells were dug by Admiral Zheng He's expedition force during their stopover in Malacca during the Ming dynasty. Bukit Cina was chosen by Zheng He to be used as the base for his expeditionary force. The Seven Wells are also known as the Dragon's wells according to fengshui principles. some of these wells were bulldozed during the 1950-60s for road building. To-date, only three wells are left intact and they have never been dried even in the worst of draught.\nZheng He's visit is recorded in verified Chinese history as compared to the fabled lore of Perigi Raja wells. Zheng He, acting under the orders of the Yongle Emperor, escorted Princess Hang Li Poh to be wed to Sultan Mansor Shah, in the 15th century. As a gift to Hang Li Poh and the Chinese settlers in Bukit Cina, Zheng He dug seven wells, which is originally known as the Perigi Raja and mistakenly called \"Hang Li Poh's well\".\nDue to the political and racial tension in the country since 2008, several rumours and disagreement regarding the history of the seven wells and also the existence of Hang Li Poh herself arose. This has contributed to many accusation being thrown to the local government by various NGOs and the opposition as the culprit of making the Malay history more colourful using it as a propaganda tool to gain support from the Chinese community.\nHowever, the accusation by certain parties that the historical details of Zheng He's expedition force puts the Malay kingdom's sovereignty in a bad light, appeared to be questionable as it is well recorded that Zheng He, who voyaged to Malacca several times, did establish a regional headquarters in Malacca in the 15th century to conduct regional diplomatic and entrepot activities in Southeast Asia due to the close relation between the Chinese empire and the kingdom of Malacca as well as the importance of Malacca as an entrepot in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese Malaysian\nOverseas Chinese\nHang Li Poh\nPeranakan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notations ===\nDe Witt, Dennis (2010).

          "It's terribly small, showing only 4 rooms; 3 of which are bedrooms and living room. It's not worth the time (within 10 min you wil be able to see all 4 rooms) and money to visit it. Entrance fees of 22 ringgit for non-Malaysians are not worth paying for it. Spend the money on better things.",
          "Staff were really nice , they helped in taking photos with funny positions,  good  and fun experience",

          "Friendly people talking you photos\nBut Little expensive",
          "It is an interesting place for group photography of family or friends. It is literally a small place with different home settings in 3 rooms and therefore it can be very crowded during weekend or holiday. The staff are very friendly and helpful to guide visitors for photography. Try to visit in the early morning to avoid crowd.",

          "It\u2019s quite small. There is only three room but each room has 3 spot to take photo. The poses recommended looks unrealistic. I suggest you do you\u2019re own pose. The props looks real and is extremely stable. The ideas are very creative.",
          "The idea of upside down is good but a bit small as there are three rooms only. Even the workers helped taking photo, but the attitude  of the workers show unwillingness.  They were playing with their phone most of the time and not even introduce themselves. Hope the attitude and the ways they provide service can be improved.",

          "Not worth at all kind of too much commercial. You pay heavily ( if you are foreigners then it's a waste of money) and inside they will tell you how to pose and click click, inside 10 min entire tour is done. With price they are charging they should provide some photo printout as a souvenir.",

          "Supposedly to put 3 stars, but +1 star is for those lovely staff who helps us to take photos all around, place is neat but small, it\u2019s VERY creative n cool to have this idea, a bit expensive, they should make more rooms and think of new spots to attract visitor. Recommend to have student discount for tourism n the local.",

        "wiki": "A maritime museum (sometimes nautical museum) is a museum specializing in the display of objects relating to ships and travel on large bodies of water. A subcategory of maritime museums are naval museums, which focus on navies and the military use of the sea.\nThe great prize of a maritime museum is a historic ship (or a replica) made accessible as a museum ship, but as these are large and require a considerable budget to maintain, many museums preserve smaller or more fragile ships or partial ships within the museum buildings. Most museums exhibit interesting pieces of ships (such as a figurehead or cannon), ship models, and miscellaneous small items associated with ships and shipping, like cutlery, uniforms, and so forth.\nShip modellers often have a close association with maritime museums; not only does the museum have items that help the modeller achieve better accuracy, but the museum provides a display space for models larger than will comfortably fit in a modeller's home, and of the museum is happy to take a ship model as a donation. Museums will also commission models.\nThere are thousands of maritime museums in the world. Many belong to the International Congress of Maritime Museums, which coordinates members' efforts to acquire, preserve, and display their material. There is a risk that too many maritime museums might dilute the experience for the public, while a poorly managed museum might put other municipalities off from the idea of hosting such a museum.At 19 acres (77,000 m2), Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut, US, can lay claim to the title of largest museum; it preserves not only a number of sailing ships, but also many original seaport buildings, including a ship chandlery, sail loft, ropewalk, and so forth. However, the UK's National Maritime Museum in Greenwich is also a contender, with many items of great historical significance, such as the actual uniform worn by Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.\nA recent activity of maritime museums is to build replicas of ships, since there are few survivors that have not already been restored and put on display. Another is operating a museum harbour, most notably in Germany and the Netherlands but elsewhere too, that offers mooring to privately owned historical vessels, which can be watched but not boarded.\n\n\n== Preservation of ships ==\nThe preservation of ships in museums ensures that ancient and historic vessels are preserved for posterity in optimum conditions and are available for academic study and for public education and interest.\nRemains of ancient and historic ships and boats can be seen in museums around the world. Where a ship is in a good state of preservation it can sometimes act as a museum in its own right. Many museum ships, such as HMS Victory are popular tourist attractions. Some ships are too fragile to be exposed outdoors or are incomplete and must be preserved indoors. The remains of the Mary Rose for example are kept in a purpose designed building so that conservation treatment can be applied.\nIn some cases, archaeologists have discovered traces of ships and boats where there are no extant physical remains to be preserved, such as Sutton Hoo, where museum displays can show what the vessel would have looked like, although the vessel itself no longer exists.\n\n\n== Notable maritime museums ==\n\n\n=== Asia and Oceania ===\n\nAustralian National Maritime Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\nQueensland Maritime Museum, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia\nTamkang University Maritime Museum, New Taipei, Taiwan\nBrunei Darussalam Maritime Museum, Kota Batu, Brunei\nKursura Submarine Museum, Visakhapatnam, India\nVisakha Naval Maritime Museum, Visakhapatnam, India\nEvergreen Maritime Museum, Taipei, Taiwan\nHong Kong Maritime Museum, Central, Hong Kong, China\nHoods Tower Naval Museum, Trincomalee, Sri Lanka\nMaritime Museum, Macau, China\nMaritime Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia\nNaval Aviation Museum, Vasco Da Gama, India\nMaritime Museum, Malacca, Malaysia\nMuseum of Maritime Science, Tokyo, Japan\nKobe Maritime Museum, Kobe, Japan\nKure maritime Museum, Kure, Japan\nNational Maritime Museum, Auckland, New Zealand\nNational Maritime Museum, Galle, Sri Lanka\nTorpedo Bay Navy Museum, Auckland, New Zealand\nSydney Heritage Fleet, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\nWestern Australian Maritime Museum, Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia\nPakistan Maritime Museum, Karachi, Pakistan\nQuanzhou Maritime Museum, Quanzhou, Fujian, China\nNational Maritime Museum, Busan, South Korea\nYM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nAalborg S\u00f8farts- og Marinemuseum, Aalborg, Denmark\nAberdeen Maritime Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland\nCit\u00e9 de la Mer, Cherbourg-Octeville, France\nDanish Maritime Museum, Kronborg Castle, Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark\nDutch Navy Museum, Den Helder, Netherlands\nFries Scheepvaart Museum, Sneek, Netherlands\nEstonian Maritime Museum, Tallinn, Estonia\nFisheries and Maritime Museum, Esbjerg, Denmark\nForum Marinum, Turku,  Finland\nGalata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy\nGerman Maritime Museum, Bremerhaven, Germany\nHull Maritime Museum, Kingston upon Hull, United Kingdom\nInternationales Maritimes Museum in Hamburg, Germany\nThe Frigate Jylland, Ebeltoft, Denmark\nLancaster Maritime Museum, Lancaster, England\nLowestoft Maritime Museum, Suffolk, England\nMalta Maritime Museum, Birgu, Malta\nMarinmuseum, Karlskrona, Sweden\nMarinemuseet, Karljohansvern, Horten, Norway\nMaritime Center Vellamo, Kotka, Finland\nMaritime Museum of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain\nMaritime Museum Ria de Bilbao, Bilbao, Spain\nMaritime Museum Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands\nMaritime Museum, Stockholm, Sweden\nMerseyside Maritime Museum, Liverpool, United Kingdom\nMus\u00e9e national de la Marine, Paris, France\nMus\u00e9e National de la Marine in Brest, Brest, France\nMus\u00e9e National de la Marine in Port-Louis, Port-Louis, France\nMus\u00e9e National de la Marine in Rochefort, Rochefort, France\nMus\u00e9e National de la Marine in Toulon, Toulon, France\nNaval Museum of Madrid, Madrid, Spain\nMuseo Storico Navale, Venice, Italy\nMuseo Tecnico Navale , La Spezia, Italy\nMuseu de Marinha, Lisbon, Portugal\nMuseum of the World Ocean, Kaliningrad, Russia\nMuseum of the Sea, Cascais\nNational Maritime Museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands\nNational Maritime Museum, Cornwall, United Kingdom\nNational Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England, United Kingdom\nNational Maritime Museum of Ireland, D\u00fan Laoghaire, Ireland\nNational Maritime Museum, Gda\u0144sk, Poland\nNational Maritime Museum in Szczecin, Poland\nPassage West Maritime Museum, Cork, Ireland\nScottish Maritime Museum, Irvine, Scotland, United Kingdom\nSouthampton Maritime Museum, Southampton, England, United Kingdom\nTurkish Naval Museum, Istanbul, Turkey\nRauma Maritime Museum, Rauma, Finland\nRoyal Danish Naval Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark\nRussian Navy Museum, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\nVasa Museum, Stockholm, Sweden\nVikin Maritime Museum in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland\nWestfjords Heritage Museum, Iceland\n\n\n=== North America ===\nThe Council of American Maritime Museums serves as network for museum professionals in North America.\n\nHistoric Ships in Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland, US\nBermuda Maritime Museum, Sandys Parish, Bermuda\nBuffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, Buffalo, New York\nColumbia River Maritime Museum, Astoria, Oregon, US\nCoral World Ocean Park, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands\nDossin Great Lakes Museum, Detroit, Michigan, US\nFlorida Maritime Museum, Cortez, Florida, US\nGreat Lakes Floating Maritime Museum, Duluth, Minnesota, US\nH.

          "Within is a museum telling you a lot about the colonial times. The Portuguese, The Dutch and the Englsih \"took care\"for Malacca until independence after 1950. The museum is really worth a visit too with nice presentations of the colonial era",
          "I always like the exterior design of this Portuguese replica ship,its a museum worth to take a picture on the outside .",

          "1. not much information 2. the wall of the ship not well maintained. theres a water leaking inside. 3. some of the display box are damage with no lighting",
          "This is a classic extra, it's only ten rm to go in so no need to fuss about the price. There is a pleasant hour of wander around but not something I would plan for and put on a must do list.",
          "We visited Malacca because we were interested in the layers of history and cultures, and this museum is a good place to learn more about that. The museum is housed in a replica Portuguese ship, containing layers of history on the different levels (which you access via stairs).",
          "I've visited this place with my partner. There's an entrance fee Adult(Malaysian) - Rm5 and Adult(Foreigner) - Rm10. By purchasing the ticket, you can use to visit the maritime museum as well located across the road. The atmosphere of the ship was really nice.",

          "Our daughter, 5, wanted to see this replica ship. So we went aboard and had some fun walking around. Nor sure why foreigners pay 2x the price as Malaysian people as we all saw the same thing. The ship was easy to walk around and had some interesting mock ups of model ships",

          "A replica of the Portuguese ship which sank in the coast of Malacca while on its way to Portugal. Great introduction to the maritime history of Melaka.",
          "I went here with my husband during our short holiday in Malacca. It is located adjacent to a number of tourist attraction in the old city area. The museum is located inside a replica of a Portuegese ship. It is very eyecatching from outside. Inside there are a lot of info panels",
          "The museum tells a story about the time the Portuguese invaded Malaka. At the time, Malaka was an important place in Asia for colonialism. The ship/museum is a nice little cultural place. Take about an hour and visit it to get a great historic feel of Malaka.",
          "Beautiful reconstruction of an old world Portuguese trading ship. It is a stunning museum when you see it from the dockside and inside is very interesting with lots of displays on the history of Melaka as a trading port, especially in Spices.We were there early in the morning",
          "This museum inside a Portuguese ship is an interesting concept. It has some nice photo opportunities and generally well kept. Not too large but it also has options to take audio tour.",
          "This was a pleasure. You could go onboard the ship and read all about the way in which Melaka developed as a trading port over the years from the original traders through the Portuguese, Dutch and British invaders.",
          "This is a good effort to replicate a former ship and its history, but it just falls short in many ways. Be patient among the crowds and playing children and you may actually be able to read and absorb some of the amazing history.",
          "The museum could use some sort of guide. We went through thinking it was just the boat deck to then find out there were panels of information inside the boat. The information was super interesting but I agree that it could be presented in a better way, especially with children",
          "This museum needs to up it's game a bit. The big ship could be made a lot more interesting. It was mostly large panels of information about Melaka (some of which repeated themselves) and the few artifacts actually displayed weren't really commented on. The ticket also covers two",
          "The maritime museum is 3 different exhibits, first the replica sailing ship which takes you chronologically through the history of Melaka, then the second building covers all of Melaka's maritime world and the third is a maritime military museum with some very modern exhibits",
          "The museum was good. But there are few issues I've encountered. - The counter was close quite early. At 4:30 pm there were no one there. - When I came back on the next morning there were no one on the souvenir counter. So I was not able to buy some souvenirs. The people needs to",
          "This ship is really historical with great facts around in the ship. The explanation posters are clear and good but there is really an urgent need to look into the air-conditioning system which was leaking and sometimes not switched on. Can be stuffy at times but great feel while",
          "It is located near malls and the visitors can have a stroll while taking pictures as well. The huge boat in the middle of the garden is such a view. During the day, don't forget to wear sunglasses because the sun shines very brightly.",
          "The big replica of the wooden boat cannot be missed. It is visible from pretty much anywhere if you are in the centre of the old town. If you are travelling with kids, its a great activity, entrance is quiet cheap and lot of texts on history of the city. I would recommend you",
          "Probably the best museum in Malacca. BUT not that interesting. It's mainly reading texts rather than seeing artifacts. But it's a great way to learn the history of Malacca.",
          "I enjoyed the maritime museum and the ship. Kids got to learn first hand about what merchant traded past, the fashion and trade routes. Not to be missed if you have yound kids.",
          "The entrance fees were cheap and it covered 3 museums. There were descriptions and histories of all the things and pictures that were on displayed. We rented 2 interactive earphones ( RM3 each ) for our children as there were too many things to read in the ship. So the",
          "If you are a fan of the old Melaka, then this is a must-place to visit since besides being a good background for an impressive selfie, the information provided within the museum is extensive - since before Melaka even began. This is my second visit and they have further",
          "Great looks on the outside, average on the inside. It is definitely GREAT for those who are interested in history of Melaka and different ships that travelled to Melaka for all sorts of trading and stuffs. Might be a lil boring to those who are not interested but good for",
          "A visit here is great if you'd like to learn about the history of Malacca as a port, and how it passed between the Portuguese, Dutch and British. You'll walk around 3 different levels and read information boards, an audio guide is also available for 3 MYR, but I didn't take",
          "The maritime museum looks very impressive from the outside, however the inside lets the place down a little. The boat itself is great and is a great draw to the museum but it seems to be only that. The place isn't really child friendly as the inside of museum involves a lot of",
          "A museum in a very huge ship. This is a nice place to take photo and learn about history of trading in Melaka",

          "The boat is said to be replica of a real one, however it's not worth a visit as there's not much to see or do",
          "Just a quick passing by photo opportunity but it is a really well made replica of the real ship and is made to scale.",
          "When we arrive there, it is close so we go around nearby and not really a interesting place. But surrounding area has a lot more for sightseeing.",
          "This is a place that is not recommended as its overpriced and nothing is in any way authentic. Nothing to see inside and is basically a poor photo op.",
          "It was heritage site. I love some places like this, not so noisy. Just relax, walking around, tasting foods and get the stories about. I do not like much other destination in Malaysia but Melaka is recommended to visit. I did a day tour around the city.",
          "The boat is said to be replica of a real one, however it's so from the exterior only. The interior itself doesn't have much to do with a real ship, it's used as a museum but not interesting by itself. Not worth of the visit if your primary aim is to see how the interior of the",
          "worth a browse around, lots of stuff to read regarding the history of the ships I think kids would love this more than 2 50somethings",
          "Enjoyed going into this replica. Very nice that it was built in this location so you can enjoy it. The boat is the actual museum so it is cool. The information given in this museum isn't too accurate though and it is like all museums in Malaysia pushing the Muslim ideology.",
          "Nothing much here, besides some history and the replica ship. Kids will love the ship as they get to climb up and down it but inside, there isn't much to it. The inside is air-conditioned so it makes a good respite from the heat. It is not weelchair or stroller accessible so",
          "A odd looking replica remember i am from england we have the real deal mary rose golden hind, amd many more but again kids might like it .",
          "Most enjoyable visit, take the audio option as it is very informative, good layout and well put together, worth a visit",

          "Located only 10min on foot from the Red Square, we only went to the 'ship' section of the museum. Due to preserving the wood floors of the ship, shoes are to be removed prior to entering the air-conditioned interiors. Inside details the historic trades, wars and piracy events",
          "The museum consists of three buildings with the highlight being the ship replica. As most Melaka museums you need to take your shoes off inside the exhibition (for no reason). The items on display are quite interesting if you are interested in marine life or in sea expeditions",
          "It is a small space. However, the exhibits are well layout and will provide you with some easy to understand tour around the ship. My highlight of the trip there was taking some photos on top of the ship.",
          "I didn't went inside but from the exterior, it is very cool and interesting. It is a fake ship I guess but a nice place to take photos",
          "Rather boring presentation of what could potentially be a rather exciting history lesson, I don't understand the need to take shoes off nor the rather racist dual pricing policy, only that very morning had the paper been full of the inequity in Malaysians visiting Singapore and",
          "The museum is in three parts, on both sides of the road. The replica of the Portuguese ship is probably the highlight, but I enjoyed the museum on the other side of the road, with all the information on the Malaysian Navy. The other building, on the same side of the road as the",
          "Visited this with the my family with young children. The experience is nice, but there are a lot of things to explain to the kids. We loved the ship model displayed inside where we can observe different type of ships used by different country. Other than that, the other display",
          "The ticketing needs to be improved. Selectively asking for identification as we supposingly look like aliens! Nothing really creative inside. Everywhere need to take off your shoes, really! If not for the kids will not go in at all.",
          "Visited this museum during praying time on a Friday. The museum gives an interesting insight to the history of Melacca for the past 500 years. The shape of the museum is of course particular.",
          "well this is a museum so not all people will like it , it is optional to get in or not. the big boat can be easily spotted from far away. not hard to find.",
          "One of the features or policy I truly love in Melaka in touring their museums is their one ticket system. For adult tourists, you will pay 20 Ringgit, need to present the ticket upon entering the museums. The ticket booth is located right at the foot of the ship. It was on a",
          "Able to know more about the history of Malacca. Our foreigner friends were amazed at the history of Malacca",
          "the ticket is rm5 for adult and it is worthy to enter the museum to know more about the historical of maritime... the view is scenary and you will be able to see the beautiful view of melacca river.... one of the must visit museum in melacca",
          "Enjoyed looking through the replica ship and the attached museum. Lots of information on the history of Melaka and how it has evolved over the years. We enjoyed our visit and would recommend it.",
          "If you want to know more about the maritime in melaka in the 80's or so, you should go here. the ticket is cheap and probably acceptable as we are entitled to 3 museums (maritime museum-on replica ship , maritime museum 2-in a building and a navy museum-TLDM) with one ticket.",
          "The replica of an old ship was an interesting way to bring to life for kids their pirate fantasy. At the same time you learn about the history of Malacca, about sailing and colonial days. Well worth the entry fee. The place was also clean and generally well kept.",
          "Being on the ship was fun. Imagining you are the captain of the ship is even more fun. Its the idea behind it which makes it most enjoyable.",
          "It's very interesting to view n go this museum because of the knowledge n shape of the ship. The explanation were clear .price to in adult rm5 children rm3.",
          "it is basically an old wooden ship that is used to show the life of old people in living in the sea. For children, this is amazing. the experience is nice. However the museum is not equipped enough. there are many possible things to be added to the place to give you the",
          "Climb aboard and you feel you are ready to disembark. Amazing to believe they used to sail vessels like this on the high seas. This replica holds numerous artifacts to view as you wander about below deck. Melaka is a city greatly influenced by the countries that colonized the",
          "A Portugese battleship in the city centre? The Maritime Museum is beside the Malacca River, striking an awesome sight. Climbing onto the deck of the ship invokes a sense of excitement. On the deck, it offers a panoramic view of the surrounding. The canons on the side of the",
          "I was first time visit this museum quite few year ago . Inside was quite nice but abit smelly when we walk nearby the air-conditional system. I hope the system had already renovated.",
          "Yes I love this museum so much. You get to learn about ship of course but the exterior and interior of this museum is what makes it worth coming here. My sister and I both feel like we are the captain of the sea and pretending to be one of the ship crew. This is a splendid place",
          "This interesting ship is located next to the Malacca River. It is quite interesting and informative. Can be a bit hot inside. Good place to take photos especially on the deck.",
          "Personally i was not impressed by this as it was not my cup of tea. There were a lot of exhibitions and you get to learn about the history of Flora de la Mar Maritime Museum. An informative and interesting experience for those that are into warships and history.",
          "Younger kids will enjoy the trip on the ship. What I did not understand is the portion of the museum that had sea life - marine life in maritime museum! I don't see the connection to that of being historic ! Lets just say it would not be the end if the world if you gave this",
          "It is really attractive, the idea is excellent, will they manage it properly. Nothing much to see inside the muzium except some history of Melaka, which you can easily get by google it.",
          "Most of the information is repeated in Muzium Sejarah dan Ethnografi, Stadhuys. And, it is very very hot inside the ship.",
          "worth a 1-hour visit, barefooted, cheap ticket fare (RM3 for adult & RM1 for below 12yo children), had fun overcoming your claustrophobic while learning about history of Malacca in the ship's tummy!",
          "I enjoyed very much to drop my shoes and enter this museum to discover the history of Malacca! The boat itself is nicely kept. I think it's great for children to have a glimpse of the naval history of Malacca ;)",
          "The museum is housed in a replica of the Flor de la Mar, a Portuguese vessel that sank off the Malacca coast. Information on the history of Malacca from the sultanate of Malacca in the 14th century to the pre-independence era is well documened here. Also saw many models of",
          "Hey. Come to visit here if u want to feel like titanic. Price is affordable & don't forget to bring your identity card. Much more cheaper. Big place & u can look around the ship to take picture",
          "The Museum is really small but there are a lots of information about the melakka history! For me 10 RM it's absolutely ok",
          "More inside than we realise. Interesting and everything is kept easy to read. Grandparents and grandchildren enjoyed it too. The big ship replica outside is a big crowd draw , and a good picture opportunity.",
          "The museum is a replica of Flor de la Mar, a Portuguese ship. Couldn't help imagining myself being part of the crew member as I explored the ship. The many steep steps are not wheelchair friendly. But for such an interesting overview of Melaka's history through different",
          "Replica boat used as part of the museum and provides a timeline into the history of Melaka. Another building also contains information on maritime history. In all it is like walking around reading a giant encyclopedia on sign boards with very few real displays.",
          "They improved on having audio tours. What's disappointing is that the place is not well maintained. The roof was leaking and there's buckets everywhere. Don't forget to go across the street to the TLDM museum. They need to put proper lables on their display items. There was a",
          "anybody interested in history will like this place. recommended for family outings go before 6 in the evening as they close early",
          "Not much to do, just sight seeing. But there are many replicas and histories inside. It's good for children to learn more about Malacca. And the location is just near by the Dutch Square.",
          "huge Replica of a portuguese ship. Not much to do in the ship, only sight seeing. Becareful though, the ladder is steep. If you enter the area you have to pay RM 10 For adult, it include maritime museum.",
          "Location : just 100 meter from stadhyus Entry Fee : Free (just sightseeing from outside). Time recommended : Morning or afternoon",
          "Very well executed. Worth getting the audio guide for information of the different eras. Another great museum in Melaka",
          "Admission is 10RM and worth every penny for some one like me who knew little about Melaka. We enjoyed the ship best. I wished the audio station was open as it would have made my learning even more interesting. Also, I would recommend the organizers add Chinese or a visual to",
          "Museums are in plenty in Melaka, but this is one of the best ones. My first maritime musuem was very much impressive!!",
          "If you interested in sea life and ship go in side but there is nothing special better take photos out and go",
          "Museum inside is such a bore! The ship view from outside is nice. Stairs are steep and is difficult to climb especially accompanied by kids",
          "10rm entrance fee. The ship and the museum in the ship are the best. Next to the ship there is another museum, but that one is old and the displays are coverd in a thick layer of dust. Not everything is translated in English, a shame because tourists have to pay more than the",
          "Visit into this galleon introduces the historic lives of the seamen living on the galleon and the role of the galleon boosting trades across seas",
          "Found it as the most interest it visit there. It s at least original, kids will like it. It isn t like one Universal Studios, it s just an small expo, recommended to go. Rates for foreigners STILL affordable. Hope don t change as everithing is changing every day at Malaka.",
          "Extremely reasonable for some photo opportunities. Pirates on hand to make it more memorable and centrally located.",
          "There is an entrance fee that we must pay. Secondly, the ship is hugh but it feels old. The exhibits are boring and not captivating enough. Not worth to visit a second time..",
          "Slightly difficult to find parking. Very informative and fun activity for children. The earphones for information are a bit expensive.",
          "It was a exceptional experience to ride on a old historic ship during our Melaka trip. We got the ancient flavor.",
          "It had a decent display. All of the information was really low and I had to crouch down if I wanted to read anything.",
          "I was surprised because this ship is huge and moved to the mainland. The monument shows that Melaka is a port city",
          "We came very close to these maritime museum .Very nice Wooden sailing ship.As I was Mariner,I took the interest and take lot of pictures around it.This was kept very close to the Melaka river.I wanted to go inside but due short time could not go inside the museum but knew there",
          "It's promising being an old ship's replica. However, aside from the captain's quarter, the ship is hollow and presents the history of trade in Melaka. The Stadthyus is more compelling and covers the same topic too amongst others. Don't expect to see how the people were living on",
          "The boat intrigued us, and we decided to pay a visit. Yes, tourists pay more to enter, and an extra few ringitt to access the audio guide, but this made the exhibits come alive. You can touch on and off from each audio station when you've heard enough. Our visit was mid week,",
          "A nice maritime museum that shows the history of the port of Melaka before and after the colonisation by the Portugese, Dutch and Engkish. An audio guide is provided for a fee and recommended. Need to remove your shoes before entering.",
          "The counter receptionist gave us the impression that other nationalities passport and Singapore Passport pay different prices to enter.....",
          "I love visiting museums but I became bored very quickly. To be fair, Maritime Museum really doesn't float my mind so it's probably no suprise I was bored.Sorry not to be more positive.",
          "This replica galleon is well set up as a museum and cleverly outlines the history of Malacca. Very good for children as well",
          "The ship and the museum are all part of the maritime museum. Entrance for foreigners was 20 RM. We liked the ship, but the ship is not wheel chair accessible. Be aware that you have to take off your shoes if you want to enter the ship. And do not miss the extra building on the",
          "The first part inside the boat is very historical, the building next to it is more about the great explorators and the third one is about the navy. The two first ones have more interest.",
          "More of a museum. Ok entrance fee. Interesting if you want to have a feel of a pirate ship. Inside airconditioned. Not for seniors who are not able bodied and mobile.",
          "Not worth it ! 20 ringgits for tourists, different ticket price for locals. much to see inside, we stayed no more than 15 minutes.",
          "This place is a walks distance from the Dutch square and is near to other attractions in Melaka so its easy to club all of them. I loved the innovative idea of converting a ship to a museum which show cases the history of Melaka. Its very interesting and has lots of details",
          "Fascinating depiction of Melaka and its port history telling of the different colonial influences onto her. I also found the stories of the different wayfarers interesting, especially Panglima Awang (Henry the Black) who sailed with Magellan(!). Scaling the ship was",
          "Visually this looks good. It was totally inaccessible to me as there were so many steps. Unable to judge its interest. Ticket allows entry to three 'museums'",
          "There is a small admission fee of RM$10 for foreigners (adults) but it was a respite from the intense heat of the afternoon sun. However, some climbing of stairs is required so it may not be suitable for some elderly folk who are not so agile. Exhibits were mostly of Malaysian",
          "We were here nearly 20 years ago and I must say it was a lot nicer then, Peeling paint is never a good look for a tourist attraction.",
          "Interesting history of Melaka although accuracy is left much to be desired. Kids liked the idea of the ship more than the museum itself.",
          "The interior of the boat is interesting and some displays are of interest but sadly the twists given in the representation of history reflect a Malayanisation downplaying Indian and Chinese influences. Spot the grammatical errors too.Much could be improved.",
          "An impressive boat lures you into the museum; however, that is about where the excitement ends. The exhibition is informative but unimpressive. Save your ringgit.",
          "This is a good attempt at creating a look back. However they have different prices for local and people from other countries. It does give a nice look back at the history of Melaka.",
          "This museum very intresting. From the out side it look like black pearl POC. When you get inside you can find the information of the old ship. Explore the old ship like this is very rare exp, don't miss it",
          "We really enjoyed visiting this part of the maritime museum (the old galleon). The displays and information were very good and interesting. Worth a visit especially as it is in the Centre where most of the museums and places of interest are located. The other part of the",
          "The museum exhibits the replica of Flor de la Mar. The museum also houses exhibits, artifacts and documents from the golden era of Malacca and shows how political control of Malacca was essential to the establishment of maritime dominance in the region.",
          "Another little interesting museum in Melaka, bigger inside than you think but worth going in and around and you get to go in the building attached to it as well",
          "Brought students here in June 2013. Nice small space museum indoor with AC. Children get to walk around and see the history. The museum is within the ship. It's also nice to stand on deck and see the surrounding and snap a few photos for remembrance.",
          "We popped in to this sight on our first walk around Melaka. It only costs a couple of bucks and our son (toddler) loved exploring the boat. There's not much to say: it's a historic ship that someone has pulled up on land (somehow). You can see the deck and the two floors below",
          "It cost me RM10 to enter here. I enjoyed the visit, both being on the ship reconstruction and reading the museum information. There's a lot to learn about the rise and fall of Melaka from initial settlement, European colonial powers, and decline of wealth.",
          "A creative way to learn more about Malaysia's history. I like how it's like being inside a ship. Kids would love it.",
          "My son of 6 loved this, went into the ship, looked at all the exibits, asked lots of questions, went to the Naval museum across the road and played with the Ships Guns etc. Well worth the money and time",
          "The Maritime Museum of Malacca is located just ahead of the Stadthuys. It is exactly opposite of the Medan Samudera which is a handicraft and local produce building. The best way to get to the Maritime Museum from the Stadthuys is by walking as you can appreciate better the",
          "There aren't much information about most of the artifacts inside the museum. And about the structure of the museum.",
          "I was not really looking forward to this museum at first but my kids insisted we board the ship to see what was inside. I was surprised to see the amount of information on Melaka's history given here. My kids really liked this museum. My advice would be to spend some time to",
          "It's look like newly made boat. Mahogany Color boat which quite huge and beautiful. We just walk around and take a pictures outside.",
          "I was looking forward to seeing a Portuguese galleon from the inside and learn about the history of such boats and get a feel of the life on board. To our great disappointment, it is only a boat shaped building and the exhibition inside covers the history of Melaka's harbour and",
          "This museum, being housed in a reconstruction of a Portuguese ship of a couple of centuries ago, really took your imagination to what it would have been like in those days. Just how steep the ladders and stairs were, how high the masts they had to climb in rough seas and so",
          "The outside view of the Maritime Museum is worth of taking pictures. It is a very large ship and beautiful scenery located besides the Melaka River.",
          "A good place to learn about Malacca history through the sea. We can aboard the ship. Good for kids n family holiday.",
          "This place is good in overall. Whether you are travelling with your families, with kids or not, or even you're just taking photos. This is a ship turned into a museum, it's huge and it has 2 levels inside, with lots of interesting history display. Even more beautiful when",
          "Interesting Museum of a large ship replica. I was able to appreciate more the world history of how the Portugese explorers reach distant seas and territories.",
          "One of the historical place in Malacca-good for young children to learn Malaysia history. Nice view for photography session and for education especially children.",
          "This good because it is located in a old style ship. Good place for photography and walk down to this place along the water is more nicer.",
          "I like the self- tour guide, renting a Rm3 headset to learn about Malacca. Super cheap!! Plus, Maritime museum, samudera museum and Royal Malaysian Marine museum( Muzium TLDM) 3 museums for only RM5. Cool air conditioning environment for visiting. This is definitely a must to",
          "The ship museum itself is a must visit landmark. RM10 entrance fee is charged, another RM3 for headset narrator (optional). You can also read it up on the placards displayed. Fascinating models of ships from China, Portuguese & British among all other display inside the",
          "Haha, this place is fun. I really like the idea of putting a huge ship in the town of Melaka. The ship is just beautiful.",
          "walk onboard the display real ship, read about the history. quite interesting. its very near to other historical sights too so can do this at the same time.",
          "Visiting the Flora de la Mar Maritime Museum, was one of the highlights, when we visited Malaka in Malaysia. Well worth stepping back 500 years into history.",
          "Pay the 3.00 RM for the headset ($1.00 USD). Scan the number by each display, and you will get a great, detailed history of the seafaring side of the development of Melaka (Malacca), Malaysia. The models are amazing.",
          "This replica helps visitors to reminisce the by gone years & feel a part of history when the early traders were in this area. It would be nicer if there could be a few side shows to add spice to this attraction.",
          "Great history of the arrival of Portuguese merchants in Malacca. There is an admission fees of 10 ringgits for visitors.",
          "Its only a replica ship and really only a shell with a museum inside. Take. The time to read the display boards though that explain all the history. It seemed to us that it was a really advanced state 500 years ago before several European States spoilt it. Happily the locals",
          "Very unique experience to learn about Portuguese history in Melaka. This replica is built exactly as how the real ship look like. Very interesting place to go.",
          "This ship is clearly visible just after the Red Fort. It offers an unique experience of the deep past of Melaka. There is a nominal fee to enter this museum, stepping in this fully air conditioned ship offers a grand insight of Malaccan history. From the currencies used, the",
          "The Maritime Museum is a replica of the Flora de la Mar, a Portuguese ship which was sunk off the coast of Malacca carrying loot plundered from Malacca. The exhibits include artifacts and documents from the Malacca Sultanate to the formation of Malaysia. There are quite a number",
          "by paying MYR 10, you can visit this spectacular place with complete story of Melaka. Starting from the opening story of this port, the politics behind, until it \"down\" became \"Sleepy Hollow\", complete with paintings and statue and every paintings will have explanation and",
          "The kids really enjoyed exploring the ship and the small museum to the side. My son, 6, listened to the audio tour (about $1 USD) and it kept him engaged. I would recommend this to anyone with younger children.",
          "Not worth the admission ticket. It is a mock ship and you do not see many things about how the Portuguese \"caravelas\" where uses",
          "it worth to take a look at but make sure that you visit the navy museum right across the street as it is included in the ticket",
          "The ticket prices was cheap but the historical experience was great. This is also a nice spot to take sunset pictures, just near the Melaka River cruise area so you can come here after taking the cruise. If you're into history, you must really visit this place to learn about",
          "The converted Portuguese trader houses a detailed step by step historical time line. The cool environment allows a relaxing time to immerse yourself totally in the cultural mix that spices up the local life.",
          "Historical what matter, pay for MYR 6.00 and you able to visit 3 more museum, good angle to take picture, browsing inside the ship, understand the history. Suggest to bring water quite hot inside. Inside the ship also sell the souvenir as cheap as MYR5.00 (ship replica)",
          "This ship is only walking distance from jonker street, thers a small fee if you would like to go into the museum , I just stood outside and took some photos",
          "We visited the Flora de la Mar and the Maritime museum in June 2015. Whilst the sheer scale of the ship was impressive and the displays inside interesting, the ship is in need of some maintenance and a bit of paint. TheMaritime museum also included in the ticket price is also",
          "Its a replica of a Portugese ship. many spots for taking wefie or selfie here. But the day was so hot that you feel very uncomfortable there if you stay for a long time",
          "Its a replica of a Portugese ship if im not mistaken. I really love visiting museums around malacca and i enjoyed my time here learning about history of malacca and its also a good place to hide from the heat. :D",
          "Very boring, nothing much to be \"Wowed\". Kids only find it interesting to climb up and down stairs. Opposite this ship you can find 2 storey souvenirs shops not to be missed.",
          "The Flor do Mar's longevity still remarkable. At a time when India ships were built for only three or four years of useful service, the Flor do Mar was one of the longest-lasting ships of the India run",
          "I always go to maritime museums when travelling. This was interesting being in a replica ship. It gave a good history of Melacca, there was plenty to read. We missed the second part in the adjoining building as it wasn't well sign posted.",
          "This place was cool, it has many exhibits inside and was quite cheap. It's located right on the river near the mouth so it's a great place to start if your thinking of walking the river and adjacent to this museum is the melacca river cruise if your legs are too tired to walk",
          "different fee entrance for domestic and foreign visitor. history of malaca and malay maritime. well maintain.",
          "The audio tour was the most interesting part of the museum, and for RM3 it was well worth it. Would have been easy to get lost in all the written information if we get the audio. It was small museum, but being housed in a replica ship made it that little more interesting. Gave",
          "It's parked right next to the river and next to the melaka river cruise location. So give it a go It's has simple but informative historical exhibits and displays. Some of the name were actually familiar from my history classes back at school. So it was nice to put it all in",
          "Do pay the extra for the audio guide. We originally visited to escape the heat once we heard there was aircon in the boat-an added bonus. Inside the boat itself was interesting although the adjoining museum which you are permitted to visit is dated and less informative.",
          "Took the audio tour option which was well worth it mainly because having visited many museums I was a bit weary of reading anymore information so it was great to just listen for a change, though as everything is explained through posters etc. this is not essential. Fully A.C. So",
          "This place is actually nice and good to visit. In here you can see a lot of stuff from the past with descriptions on them. It is enjoyable to learn about the history in it.",
          "We had just over one hour to spare before leaving Melaka and this was an excellent choice. We took the audioguide and found it interesting and informative. The fact it's inside a replica boat makes it really fun. Plenty of history to be learnt about the town.",
          "Interesting visit and lots of fun if you have kids! The older kids can opt for the audio guide and the younger kids can find their way around the ship and look at the statues and replicas of the ship. We only visited the main area of the ship as it was crowded (we visited over",
          "Make sure you take time to visit this unique museum. It's by far my favorite among all I've visited (and I've visited many). It's a well preserved galleon ship used during the 17th and 18th century (if I'm not mistaken) with life sized statues and diorama depicting how traders",
          "Visited the Flora de la Mar Maritime Museum, or Muzium Samudra in Malay, on 1 May 2015. Because its a long weekend ,and a national holiday of labor day , its full of people. Located at Jalan Merdeka , between the Waterwheel and Malaysia Royal Navy museum. Entrance ticket is RM 6",
          "Went with my kids, aged 5 and 7. The fruit of my loins, having watched one too many episodes of Jake and the Neverland Pirates, have themselves morphed into pirates of exceptional skill. Even the shortest of road trips would entail stops at a petrol station for some chips and",
          "We took our daughter to this museum and she loved it . part of the museum is housed in a replica wooden ship. The displays and information board told the history of Malacca in an Interesting and easy to understand way. It was fun to explore the decks of the ship too.",
          "I enjoyed the ship shaped museum, would recommend a visit, ticket gets you into 2 other museums as well, although they weren't great.",
          "The museum must is the Galleon Flora de la Mar. Inside we can find pictures, objects and documents about Malaka and the empires heritage (portuguese, dutch and british). The museum also have a environmental protection area in a separate building. Amazing place never miss this.",
          "Get crazy inside this ship as you learn along historical tidbits of the place. My nephew and niece definitely had an interesting history lesson when they saw this, far more better than what's written in books or accessed from the internet. They got to see actual ships and the",

          "We enjoyed our visit to this unusual museum! The ship itself is fascinating and it's nice that you are allowed to walk around and explore it, inside and out. The museum is very informative, however I wouldn't recommend a long stay if you are not particularly interested in",

          "I am not a big fan of Museum. But this museum, I liked. It was exciting to see and read what I learnt during history lesson during my primary school. More exciting to showcase to my boys that I know about the history and the characters. My boys liked the Ship museum as well.",
          "Bought few minature of the ships at the cost of RM5 each and another bigger is RM 15. Museum in great location and good maintenance. Adult ticket RM 6, child ticket RM2 (7 to 12 yrs) and half price if is Malaysian. Free for below 6 yrs old.",
          "My partner and I were looking forward to seeing the replica ship and museum as he is very much into nautical stuff. The ticket cost RM6 per person, but was not worth it at all. Totally disappointing. The entire ship is only quite small, so they should implement a certain number",
          "It's a tired place with no proper guides/information at all. Not really worth paying RM6 for. I don't understand the reason behind the no-shoes policy for this museum. People are losing shoes here too.",
          "Found it ridiculous that only about 20 percent of the museum is dedicated to maritime history. The remaining displays are about the ocean, marine life and reefs. The way information is presented could also do with an overhaul. You can cover it in less than an hour if you stop",
          "The Maritime Museum is in a replica ship. The replica is not great, but they have a reasonable collection of interesting facts inside. It is just a shell, with pictures and assorted items inside. The quality is only average, but it does help transform you back to the 16th",
          "There's not much here apart from the large replica ship (a couple of boats across the road) so we thought the cover charge was a bit high for what you get. The internal displays weren't that interesting, so it seemed more like a big playground for little kids. It can be a little",
          "We were looking forward to seeing how the historically important Portuguese trading/war ship was configured, but the recreated ship is merely a shell to display pictures, etc. with no ship's wheel, no cargo place, no living quarters. The adjacent building has a couple of broken",
          "but slightly over-rated. Kids got in for free. Would have spent more time to look over the details if it wasn't so crowded. Felt as though we were on the set of Pirates of the Carribbean. Snapped a few pictures and left. The good thing about visiting Malacca is that",
          "Once you get on board this ship, you find yourself transported back in time to the days when spice traders sailed the high seas in order to expand their trade. Fascinating displays and stories.",
          "The place is well kept and divided into 3 different sections. One of them is arranged within a ship. It does not show particular things, but entrance fee is affordable and can be fun for kids. Location is close to most of Melaka attractions and therefore can be part of a tour.",
          "Not so interesting as nothing much to see except that if you have extra time to spend and also have the interest to read all the informative articles all over. Entrance fee is cheap though so cant complain much :-I Remember to wear sandals or slip-ons so its easier to take",
          "Great attraction. On the day of our visit, it was extremely hot, but the air conditioned interior of the boat made the walk around much more pleasant. Fascinating tour through the heritage of Malacca. Our two young children particularly liked climbing around the ship. Well worth",
          "If history doesnt interest you, there are ample opportunities for picture taking, and if that isnt enough, it'll be a novelty for your kids (and big kids like moi) to be able to explore a real ship! When i went in sept there were a lot of people, the tickets were really cheap",
          "For the price, I thought it was a pretty good deal to have access to three museums/buildings. My favorite was the ship re-creation of the Flor de la Mar / Maritime Museum. Many of the reviews call the exhibits boring. Not so for our group. Perhaps people want more interactive",
          "Nice replica of the ship and good for photo taking. Although not much interaction activities, it is quite informative of the history. Very steep steps and recommended to go during the night so it will not be so sunny and hot.",

          "Went to visit the museum August 2013. Definitely worth a visit! Although the boat is a replica, it's interesting inside and has fab views - good for taking pics! Kids there seemed to love it. Agree that the museum could be more interactive but still interesting and I'd recommend",
          "even if the price is nothing (RM6) to visit the boat and the museum, it is enough from outside. nothing really amazing in the replica boat, and the museum is really boring. a little bit more interactive things will be welcome",

          "The museum is shaped like an old sea vessel and from the description it made it sound like the boat was a replica of a sea vessel but instead the inside is a museum that has exhibits about Melaka during the time it was a colony, the different ships that sailed there and how life",
          "It seems that you are on board. It tells you about the voyage and anything about the glorious of Melaka for centuries. After visit this ship, don't forget to enter to the extend building to see another collections. It's the right of the exit gate. Many people miss it.",
          "Buy you ticket at the booth below the ship. This ticket gives you access to two other museums. One just next to the ship and also the navel museum across the road. Displays are interesting and a great concept of housing it in this replica ship. The only criticism is that in some",
          "It looks good looking outside, but not so worth to pay to enter. They did not show much as real. It was just typical museum that showing imitations. They have 2nd buidling which was more lame. At the end, somehow, theme of maritime became \"space\". Old coupe were selling stones",

          "Prayed Isyak there. Going into the mosque carpark entrance, we almost got lost as it was dark but we followed people who were walking in the same direction. Should have more streetlights to guide. Once we reached the compounds of the mosque, we couldn't help but take pictures",

          "I would say that apart from the mosque being built on an island and having a beautiful view of the Straits of Malacca, there is no real old history behind it. No guides available at site but one could always look into the tourism flyers or books to get some information. At the",

It is located at the summit of St. Paul's Hill and is today part of the Malacca Museum Complex comprising the A Famosa ruins, the Stadthuys and other historical buildings.\n\n\n== History of the church ==\nThe original structure was a simple chapel built in 1521 dedicated to the Virgin Mary and known as the Nossa Senhora da Annunciada (Our Lady of the Annunciation). The chapel was built by a Portuguese fidalgo or nobleman, Duarte Coelho, as an act of gratitude following his escape from a storm in the South China Sea.The chapel was deeded to the Society of Jesus in 1548 by the Bishop of Goa, Jo\u00e3o Afonso de Albuquerque, with the title deeds received by St. Francis Xavier. The chapel was then further enlarged in 1556 with the addition of a second floor, and a belfry tower was added in 1590. The chapel was then renamed the Igreja de Madre de Deus (Church of the Mother of God).\nA burial vault was opened in 1592 and many people of distinction were buried there, including Pedro Martins, the second Bishop of Funay, Japan.\n\n\n=== Association with St. Francis Xavier ===\nIn 1548, St. Francis Xavier with the help of fellow Jesuits, Fr. Francisco Peres and Brother Roque de Oliveira, established a school in the premises of the chapel known as St. Paul's College. This was perhaps the first school in the modern sense to be established on the Malay peninsula.Xavier used the church as his base for his missionary journeys to China and Japan. In one of those journeys, Xavier fell sick and in 1552 in Shangchuan Island, China he would die.\nIn 1553, the body of Xavier was disinterred from Shangchuan Island and temporarily buried at the church before it was finally shipped to Goa. An open grave in the church still exists today marking the place of Xavier's burial.\n\n\n=== Reconsecration and abandonment ===\nWith the conquest of Malacca by the Dutch in 1641, the church was reconsecrated for Dutch Reformed use as St. Paul's Church also known as the Bovenkerk or High Church. The church remained in use as the main church of the Dutch community until the new Bovenkerk (better known today as Christ Church Malacca) was completed in 1753.The old church was then subsequently deconsecrated and the structure modified and strengthened as part of the fortifications of Malacca. The nave of the church was then used as a churchyard.\nWhen the British occupied Malacca in 1824, the church was used as a powder magazine and was allowed to deteriorate further.\n\n\n=== Excavations and later additions ===\nEfforts to preserve records of monuments from the past such as the tombstones found in St. Paul's Church were photographed by the Resident Councillor of Malacca, Robert Norman Bland and published in his 1905 work, Historical Tombstones of Malacca.In 1924, the old Portuguese burial vault in the chancel of the church was partially uncovered. Further excavation was done in 1930 by the president of the newly formed Malacca Historical Society, Major C. E. Bone. It was in this period that the tombstones that were scattered around in the vicinity of the church were affixed to the walls.In 1952, a statue of St. Francis Xavier was erected in front of the ruins of the church in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his sojourn in Malacca. A day after the statue was consecrated, a large casuarina tree fell on it, breaking off its right arm. Incidentally, the right forearm of Xavier was detached in 1614 as a relic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Malaysia\nPortuguese Malacca\nMalacca Light\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDe Witt, Dennis (2013).

          "The 350+ old church on top of the hill has many steps to climb, gigantic trees, vendors and graves. Only the walls and 8-10 fascinating carved stones leaning on the inner walls are in the church. The view of the distant sea and port is nice. It is amazing that evergreen",
          "Do not let the steepness of the hill put you off going up to the top as the view is well worth the effort. When walking round the church do look out for the English grave just inside on the left to a young lady who died here.",

        "wiki": "Malacca City (Malay: Bandaraya Melaka or Kota Melaka), is the capital city of the Malaysian state of Malacca. As of 2010 it has a population of 484,885. It is the oldest Malaysian city on the Straits of Malacca, having become a successful entrep\u00f4t in the era of the Malacca Sultanate. The present-day city was founded by Parameswara, a Sumatran prince who escaped to the Malay Peninsula when Srivijaya fell to the Majapahit. Following the establishment of the Malacca Sultanate, the city drew the attention of traders from the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, as well as the Portuguese, who intended to dominate the trade route in Asia. After Malacca was conquered by Portugal, the city became an area of conflict when the sultanates of Aceh and Johor attempted to take control from the Portuguese.\nFollowing a number of wars between these territories, Aceh declined in influence while Johor survived and expanded its influence over territory previously lost to Aceh in Sumatra when Johor co-operated with the Dutch who arrived to establish dominance over Java and Maluku Islands. However, due to royal internal strife between the Malay and Bugis, the Johor-Riau Empire was divided into the sultanates of Johor and Riau-Lingga. This separation became permanent when the British arrived to establish their presence in the Malay Peninsula. The Dutch, who already felt threatened in the presence of the British, began conquering the Riau-Lingga Sultanate along with the rest of Sumatra, while Johor came under British influence following the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824.\nWhen the British succeeded in extending their influence over the Malay Peninsula, the city soon became an area of development under the Straits Settlements as part of the British Empire. The development and burgeoning prosperity were, however, halted when the Japanese arrived in World War II and occupied the area from 1942 to 1945. During the occupation, many of the city's residents were taken and forced to construct the Death Railway in Burma (present-day Myanmar). After the war, the city was returned to the British and remained as the capital of Malacca. The status as a capital remained until the formation of Malaysia in 1963, and in 2008 it was listed, together with George Town of Penang, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its long history.The economy of Malacca City is largely based on tourism. As the economic centre of the state of Malacca, it also hosts several international conferences and trade fairs. The city is located along the Maritime Silk Road, proposed by China in 2013. Among the tourist attractions in Malacca City are A Famosa, Jonker Walk, Little India, Portuguese Settlement, Stadthuys, Maritime Museum, Christ Church, Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum and Taming Sari Tower.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to legend, the site that is now Malacca City was named Malaka when Parameswara, a Sumatran prince arrived there. While he was resting under a tree known as a Malacca tree, he saw his warrior's hunting dogs were challenged and kicked into a river by a tiny mouse deer. Amused by this, he chose to name the site Malaka after the tree under which he was sitting. When the city came under Portuguese administration, its name was spelled \"Malaca\", under Dutch administration as \"Malakka\" or \"Malacka\", and under British rule, \"Malacca\". The Straits of Malacca were named after the city at the time of the Malacca Sultanate.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding of Malacca ===\n\nMalacca was established when Parameswara, who had escaped from Palembang in Sumatra, decided to build a new kingdom following Malay Srivijaya's fall in 1377 after being attacked by Javanese Majapahit. Before he reached the site, he arrived in Temasek, which he decided to make the centre of the new Malay Kingdom's administration. But when Parameswara lived there, he killed Temagi, a Regent of Singapura who served under the Siamese King to take over the throne from Temagi. Fearing further reprisals by Siam when the news reached the Siamese Kingdom, Parameswara decided to move to a new place. After he left Temasek, it was attacked by Majapahit. Parameswara then headed to the north of Malay Peninsula and arrived at Muar, where he tried to establish another new kingdom at either Biawak Busuk or Kota Buruk, but found the locations unsuitable.Parameswara continue his journey to the north, where he reportedly visited Sening Ujong (now Sungai Ujong) before arriving at a Malay fishing village at the mouth of Bertam River (now Malacca River). He decided to stop there to rest. While he was resting under a tree, he saw his follower's hunting dogs fighting with a small mouse deer before they were kicked into a river by the deer. Amused by this, he thought the place he rested must be an unusual place; following this event, in 1396 he announced the place would be called Malaka. Soon, the site became the centre of the Malay world in the 15th and 16th centuries and the most prosperous entrep\u00f4t in the Malay Archipelago. In 1403, the first official Chinese trade envoy led by Admiral Yin Qing arrived in Malacca. Later, Parame\u015bwara was escorted by Zheng He and other envoys in his successful visits. Malacca's relationships with Ming granted protection to Malacca against attacks from Siam and Majapahit and Malacca officially submitted as a protectorate of Ming China. This encouraged the development of Malacca into a major trade settlement on the trade route between China and India, Middle East, Africa and Europe. To prevent the Malaccan empire from falling to the Siamese and Majapahit, he forged a relationship with the Ming dynasty of China for protection. Following the establishment of this relationship, the prosperity of the Malacca entrep\u00f4t was then recorded by the first Chinese visitor, Ma Huan, who travelled together with Admiral Zheng He. On his descriptions, he wrote;\n\nMalacca was a well-established city surrounded by a palisade with four gates and watch towers. Inside the walled towers was a second fortification, a kind of citadel, within whose confines were the merchants' godowns, the treasury and food storehouses. The Malacca River divided the city into two almost equal halves, the southern half being the inner citadel and the ruler's compound and the northern half, reached by a bridge some distance from the river mouth, containing the residents of many foreign merchants. The bridge and its approaches comprised the main venue for all commercial kinds. Constructed on the bridge was about a score of market stalls: an easy location for small watercraft to reach with their loads of produce and also close to the docks where foreign sea-going vessels unloaded goods for transhipment.\nIn Malacca during the early 15th century, Ming China actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for treasure voyages into the Indian Ocean. Malacca had been a relatively insignificant region, not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both Ma Huan and Fei Xin, and was a vassal region of Siam. In 1405, the Ming court dispatched Admiral Zheng He with a stone tablet enfeoffing the Western Mountain of Malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country. The Chinese also established a government depot (\u5b98\u5ee0) as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers. Ma Huan reported that Siam did not dare to invade Malacca thereafter. The rulers of Malacca, such as Parameswara in 1411, would pay tribute to the Chinese emperor in person. Because of its strategic location, Malacca was an important stopping point for Zheng He's fleet. To enhance relations, Hang Li Po, according to local folklore, a daughter of the Ming Emperor of China, arrived in Malacca, accompanied by 500 attendants, to marry Sultan Manshur Shah who reigned from 1456 until 1477. Her attendants married locals and settled mostly in Bukit Cina. Due to Chinese involvement, Malacca had grown as key alternative to other important and established ports. Due to the large influence of Arab, Persian, and Indian traders, Malacca soon turned into an Islamic sultanate, and Parameswara converted to Islam when he married a princess from Pasai, changing his name to Sultan Iskandar Shah. With the rise of Melaka as an empire, both the Majapahit and Siamese kingdoms were unable to conquer it, especially with the Chinese protection. During this time, an Hindu\u2013Malay and Tamil\u2013Malay society were also formed. The Sultan died in 1414 and was succeeded by his son, Megat Iskandar Shah. Malacca continued to prosper until the eighth Sultanate of Malacca, Mahmud Shah, with the various races who came to trade becoming associated with particular trade specialties; the Gujaratis, Tamils, and Bengalis were mostly cloth merchants, the Arabs and Persians waited for their vessels to be filled with goods from China, the Chinese dealt mainly in silk, camphor, and porcelain, and the natives of Malay Archipelago, like the Bugis and other island peoples, traded mainly in spices and sandalwood, and the Minangkabau in pepper and gold, with the Javanese controlling the rice and imported foodstuffs. Like other traders, the Chinese established their own area in the city, occupying the southeast side of the port around a hill called Bukit Cina, where they constructed temples and a well called Hang Li Poh's Well, named after Hang Li Po, the fifth wife of the sixth Sultan of Malacca, Mansur Shah, who was a Chinese princess from the Ming Dynasty.\n\n\n=== European conquest ===\n\nDue to its riches, the news of the success of Malacca reached the Portuguese, who had an established presence on Indian ports. The Portuguese, under King Manuel I, sent a representative named Diogo Lopes de Sequeira to establish contact with the Sultanate. At the first, Sequeira was well received by Sultan Mahmud Shah. But the Tamil Muslim community, who already had an established presence in Malacca, convinced the Sultan to eliminate the Portuguese based on their treatment of the Muslims of Goa. Reacting to the report, Sultan Mahmud then ordered several men from the Portuguese delegation to be captured and killed, but some of them managed to escape with their ships. Thus, in April 1511 Afonso de Albuquerque, who was the Portuguese expedition leader together with his armada, arrived in Malacca to sever its Islamic and Venetian trade. His intention was described in his own words when he arrived to Malacca:\n\nIf they were only to take \"Malaca\" out of the hands of the Moors, Cairo and Mecca would be entirely ruined, and Venice would then be able to obtain no spiceries except what her merchants might buy in Portugal.\nThe Portuguese launch their first attack on 25 July 1511, but this was met with failure. Albuquerque then launched another attack on 15 August 1511, which proved successful as Malacca was captured on that day. The Portuguese constructed a fortress called A Famosa using rocks and stones taken from Muslim graves, mosques, and other buildings. Several churches and convents, a bishop's palace, and administrative buildings such as the governor's palace were built. The Portuguese imposed higher taxes on Chinese traders and restricted their ownership of land. The news of the city's capture reached the Ming Dynasty of China; the Chinese were also displeased about the kidnapping of many Chinese children by the Portuguese in Tuen Mun. In retaliation for Portugal's activity in Malacca, several Portuguese were later killed by the Chinese in the battles of Tunmen and Xicaowan in China.By the mid-16th century, the two sultanates of Aceh and Johor had arisen to take control of Malacca from the Portuguese which then became the centre of struggle between the three. By 1564, Aceh had retaken Aru (a territory which Sumatra had previously lost to Johor) and destroyed Johor's capital, Johor Lama, with the Johor royal family taken to Aceh to rule Johor as a vassal state. Other attacks were carried out in 1570, 1613, and 1623, when Johor tried to break away from Aceh. Aceh's ambition for domination later led to a clash with the Portuguese in Malacca. The two sultanates and the Portuguese became involved in a triangular war, but when both the Portuguese and the Johor saw Aceh as a threat due to its constant attacks against them, the two began to collaborate to fight Aceh. In 1582 the Portuguese assisted Johor to thwart an attack by Aceh, but arrangement ended when Johor attacked the Portuguese in 1587. Aceh continued its attacks against the Portuguese, and was later destroyed when a large additional armada from the Portuguese port in Goa came to defend Malacca and destroy the sultanate.\n\nAfter Aceh was left weakened, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) arrived, and Johor formed a treaty with them to flush out the Portuguese in the second capture of Malacca. The Dutch succeeded at overtaking Malacca while Johor managed to re-establish its suzerainty over many of its former dependencies in Sumatra, such as Siak (1662) and Indragiri (1669). The Dutch expanded the size of the city fort and built a significant amount of additional infrastructure. As they had less interest in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra than they had in Java and the Maluku Islands, the Dutch remained neutral in local disputes until 1756 when the Bugis, who ruled the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, began to threaten Dutch maritime trade. The threats increase in the 18th century, when English rivalry started to establish its presence over areas in the northern Malay Peninsula. This led the Dutch to seize the Bugis areas of Riau and expel the Bugis from both Riau and Selangor, for fearing that these areas would otherwise have fallen under British rule. Malacca was placed under the direct control of Batavia in Java.\n\nFrom 1796 until 1801, and 1807 to 1818 Malacca was temporarily placed under a British Resident as the Netherlands were conquered by France in the Napoleonic Wars. It was returned to the Dutch in 1818. Malacca served as the staging area for the British victory in 1811. A treaty was later signed in 1824 between the British and Dutch to prevent further British influence in Java; one result was that the Johor-Riau Empire fell under two colonial powers along with Malacca, which was then officially handed to the British in 1825 and integrated as part of the Straits Settlements. The city came under direct control of a Resident in Penang, and the old fort in the city was then dismantled. The British established regulations for infrastructure with the construction of, for example, back alleys, chimneys, back yards, fire escapes, fire alleys, and pedestrian arcades.\n\n\n=== World War II, post-independence and present ===\n\nDuring the first stage of World War II, the city's residents continued to live normally until the news of the Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse on 10 December 1941 reached the city and struck panic. British colonial officials began to flee and thousands of the city's residents hid in rubber estates and jungles since they heard about the acts of cruelty committed in other parts of Malaya following their conquest by the Japanese. The Japanese Army arrived in the city on 14 January 1942 in a convoy of bicycles, but as they mainly focused on ensuring the retreat of the British to the south of the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, there was no major battle in the city or other parts of Malacca. During their occupation, a kempeitai headquarters was established in the formerly British \"Government Rest House\" which served as a place for arrests, torture and executions. Those who still lived in the city were given low rice rations with a tapioca supplement and a number of them were taken to Thailand and forced to construct the Burma\u2013Siam Railway.When the Allies began to counter-attack against the Japanese, the Japanese officially surrendered to the Allies in August 1945 with the city left undamaged as there were no heavy battles, and it was administered as part of the British Military Administration until the formation of the Malayan Union and then the Federation of Malaya. After Malaya achieved its independence on 31 August 1957, a colonial building named \"Malacca Club\" was built by the British in the city as the social centre for Britons in British Malaya. The building was then turned into a memorial after 38 years to commemorate the Malayan independence day. After the Federation of Malaya, together with North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Malacca was extensively developed and in 2003 it was granted city status. On 7 July 2008, Malacca City was listed as one of the historical cities in Malaysia, together with George Town in the northern Malay Peninsula.\n\n\n== Capital city ==\n\nMalacca City is the centre of political and economic administration for the state of Malacca. There is one member of parliament (MP) representing one parliamentary constituency in the city: Kota Melaka (P.138). The city also elects five representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Kesidang, Kota Laksamana, Duyong, Bandar Hilir and Telok Mas.\n\n\n=== Local authority and city definition ===\nThe city is administered by the Malacca City Council (Majlis Bandaraya Melaka Bersejarah, MBMB). Formerly known as Malacca Municipal Council (Majlis Perbandaran Melaka Bandaraya Bersejarah, MPMBB), it was merged with the \"Malacca Municipality Area\" on 1 January 1977 with a new combined area of 114.7 square miles (303 square kilometres). Then on 15 April 2003, MPMBB was upgraded into MBMB before part of its area, covering 57.66 kilometres separated for Hang Tuah Jaya Municipal Council (MPHTJ). MBMB area is currently at 277 sq kilometres as a result of land reclamation, with a new administration area of 30.86 sq kilometres. Together these areas comprise a metropolitan area of 307.86 sq kilometres. As of 2016, the current mayor is Zainal Hussin.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is located on both sides of the Malacca River near its mouth on the Straits of Malacca. The city is approximately 152 kilometres from Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Due to large-scale land reclamation, it has grown in size, especially in the south. Its physical features are characterised by flat and gently undulating land stretching from its coast.The historic central area of the city is located near the old coastline; it includes St Paul's Hill with the ruins of the Portuguese fortress, A Famosa and the Dutch Square on the right (eastern) bank of the river, and the old Chinatown on the left (western) bank. The Chinese Hill (Bukit Cina), where a large old Chinese cemetery is located, was formerly located to the northeast of the city, but is now surrounded by new buildings on all sides.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMalacca's weather is hot and humid throughout the year with rainfall, the intensity of which depends on the time of the year. It is one of the driest cities in Malaysia, receiving just under 2,000 mm (79 in) of rainfall while most areas in Peninsular Malaysia receive an average of around 2,500 mm (98 in) of rainfall annually. However, Malacca has no dry season as average rainfall is more than 100 mm (3.9 in) for each month. Malacca is classified as having a tropical rainforest climate (Af) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and with no cyclones so a pure equatorial climate. The relatively stable weather allows Malacca to be visited year-round. Temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) during the day and from 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) to 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) at night, although the temperature may fall after periods of heavy rainfall.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and religion ===\nThe Malaysian Census in 2010 reported the population of Malacca City was 484,885. Malays comprised the majority with 273,844, followed by Chinese with 158,828, Indian with 20,310 and others totalling 9,732. Around 22,171 were identified as a Non-Malaysian citizens. Due to a large amount of interracial marriage since the era of the Malacca Sultanate, the city features its own ethnic mixtures of Baba Nyonya, Chitty and Kristang peoples. The Majority of the Malays were Muslims, and the Chinese and Peranakan were either Buddhist, Confucianist, Taoist or followers of other Chinese folk religions. The Indians, including the Chitty, were mainly Hindus while the Kristang were mostly Christian.\nThe Baba Nyonya are Straits-born Chinese, who have resided for generations since the era of the Malacca Sultanate as traders and intermarried with the local Malay women. They adopted the local culture and the Malay language as part of their lives while at the same time preserving some of their Chinese heritage. The Chitty are also a mixture of Indian traders with local women of various ethnic backgrounds such as Malays, Javanese, Bataks and Chinese. The Kristang exist as a result of marriage between the European Portuguese men with Malay women during the era of Portuguese Malacca.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe main language spoken in the city is the Malay, although the Baba Nyonya and Chitty have their own variations of Baba and Chitties creoles respectively. The Malaccan Portuguese have their own version of Portuguese creole, known as Kristang language.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince the era of Malacca Sultanate, the city has prospered as a successful entrep\u00f4t, putting it in the same position as Venice, Cairo and Canton. When the European conquest begin, Malacca had developed into a cosmopolitan city with a long-standing European heritage. The arrival of Chinese traders and coolie during the sultanate era and European colonisation saw a large boost to the economy, especially during the administration of Dutch and the British. In modern times, the tourism is more dominant than the primary-based industry due to its historical riches with the melting pots of cultural influences which attracted many local and foreign tourists to visiting the city, which also became part of the state economy income. In addition to its strategic location in the maritime Silk Road, the city benefited from the rise of China and India as world economic powers. Malacca City has hosted numerous national, regional and international conferences, congresses and trade fairs in the Malacca International Trade Centre.

          "A lot of fish and ocean life. But mostly in small aquarium.\nSome area allow to touch the fish, feeding and with attractive 3D animation show. \nEach with details description in English and Chinese. \nWent there during peak holidays season, too crowded.",
          "Entrance fee included free gift - magnet fridge. And they will give some quiz and need to be completed till the end of the exhibition. In rewards they will give key chain.",
          "I refuse to pay an aquarium that house a large moray eel in a tiny tank. The poor thing. It is in a small display tank in the mall out the front for you to see before going in. Glad I saw this before I spent money supporting this.",
          "A place suitable for.family to come  and visit. Witness variett of aquatic creatures that you may seen it and the rare one. Its a wonderful educational holiday destination.",

          "The turtle are no more but still a great place. You can see each fish closely. I think better than aquaria.",
          "Was surprised by how big it is inside. Good and informative time for the kids",
          "Ticket price doesn't justify seeing a few large fishes. The sea creatures looks very tortured in their small glass displays.  But good for killing time if you have kids and have no where else to go.",
          "Smallish but well kept oceanarium filled with a large variety of fresh and salt water creatures. \n\nChildren who have any interest in water life would be entertained here for an hour, or a maximum of 2 hours.\n\nRemember to keep your ticket \u2026",

          "Nice place to spend your time. Kids can spend time learning many types of sea creature. They also provide quiz for us to answer",
          "Good exposure to kids. As adults, we also learned a lot. Just a minor improvement, perhaps some labels need to be brighten up as the room was dark and hard for me to read the animals' species/names. Rm35/photo is expensive at least for me. Good staff and very helpful.",
          "Good place to bring the kids. A lot of fishes to see and a few good photo spots. Come early at the opening time to avoid crowds.",
          "Okay but could be better. Lack of \"wow\" factor. Just plain old aquarium concept. Species of marine life on exhibited are limited and the common ones. Anyways, thumbs up for the \"touch the sea cucumber\" pond area, this was really fun.",
          "I came here on weekdays, not much ppl, i think the mall itself also not much ppl. Anyway, the oceanarium itself is nice to visit, especially a close place to touch n feel the fish. :)",
          "Very convenient place and strategic for tourist and feasible for business executive accomodation",
          "Though not very big but it bring some nice experience as you can touch the fishes and my kids love the 3d glasses experience along the way.",
          "Good place for kids to explore but lack of educational informations of fish species.",
          "Learning & enjoy..good place for kids and adult to gain knowledges. But the place will be crowded if too much people inside there. The prices include sourvenier (fridge magnet, 3D specs and key chain).",

          "Some aspects were good, but often the tanks seemed overcrowded or too small for the animals inside. The large crab in the first part barely had room to turn around and there was nothing but sand in the tank. I didn't know crabs could look depressed until then.",

          "Kid's happy when I brought them here. Definitely must visit place.",

          "A suitable place for family with kids. But a bit small, quiet congested especially during school holiday.",
          "Nice place to hang out but no proper management to go the 41st floor.",
          "Interesting place with plenty of exhibits and information. Unfortunately, not everything is well maintained as there are quite a few empty exhibits which were not updated. I did enjoy the little quiz they designed with a small souvenir if it is completed correctly as it would help garner interests of young visitors.",
          "Not much variety of fish",
          "I love it. A lot of rare species can be found here..",

          "One of the entertaining places, great experience, it is a wonderful place if you have kids with you, they also have a 3D show running for the kids. The over head Shark tank and over head Rays tank are awesome to watch, it's definitely should be on every one's watch list in Malacca",
          "Wide range of species. But most of them are common. Rm33/entry is too expensive for such an amateurish aquarium. Will worth the trip if the ticket priced around rm15-20.",
          "Nice place to visit. Not too pricey.",
          "It's a medium size aquarium compared to KLCC aquarium, now I have visited both and I think The Shore oceanarium has something different to offer, it's worth to pay a visit. There's variety species of marine life that I have never seen in \u2026",
          "Many sea creatures to see but not so much as to be very tired",
          "My family and I went there on 1st of Sep, 2018. Normal ticket price for adult is RM33 and child 3 years and above is RM23. I brought my wife and 2 daughters (eldest one is 7 years old, another one is 2 years plus), due to my 7 years old \u2026",

          "Went over the weekend. Was super crowded. The aquarium selection was quite extensive for a small location. Interactive for children & good for general knowledge. The puzzle was another good way to engage the visitors. Overall a good place to kill if you have about 3hrs of spare time.",

          "Beautiful  and nice place",
          "Just an average aquarium targeted at children. Many low quality gimmicks like AR and 3D viewers left me with more of a headache than enjoyment. Subpar information panels giving very generic content of no more than 30 words. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2026",

        "wiki": "Malacca City (Malay: Bandaraya Melaka or Kota Melaka), is the capital city of the Malaysian state of Malacca. As of 2010 it has a population of 484,885. It is the oldest Malaysian city on the Straits of Malacca, having become a successful entrep\u00f4t in the era of the Malacca Sultanate. The present-day city was founded by Parameswara, a Sumatran prince who escaped to the Malay Peninsula when Srivijaya fell to the Majapahit. Following the establishment of the Malacca Sultanate, the city drew the attention of traders from the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, as well as the Portuguese, who intended to dominate the trade route in Asia. After Malacca was conquered by Portugal, the city became an area of conflict when the sultanates of Aceh and Johor attempted to take control from the Portuguese.\nFollowing a number of wars between these territories, Aceh declined in influence while Johor survived and expanded its influence over territory previously lost to Aceh in Sumatra when Johor co-operated with the Dutch who arrived to establish dominance over Java and Maluku Islands. However, due to royal internal strife between the Malay and Bugis, the Johor-Riau Empire was divided into the sultanates of Johor and Riau-Lingga. This separation became permanent when the British arrived to establish their presence in the Malay Peninsula. The Dutch, who already felt threatened in the presence of the British, began conquering the Riau-Lingga Sultanate along with the rest of Sumatra, while Johor came under British influence following the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824.\nWhen the British succeeded in extending their influence over the Malay Peninsula, the city soon became an area of development under the Straits Settlements as part of the British Empire. The development and burgeoning prosperity were, however, halted when the Japanese arrived in World War II and occupied the area from 1942 to 1945. During the occupation, many of the city's residents were taken and forced to construct the Death Railway in Burma (present-day Myanmar). After the war, the city was returned to the British and remained as the capital of Malacca. The status as a capital remained until the formation of Malaysia in 1963, and in 2008 it was listed, together with George Town of Penang, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its long history.The economy of Malacca City is largely based on tourism. As the economic centre of the state of Malacca, it also hosts several international conferences and trade fairs. The city is located along the Maritime Silk Road, proposed by China in 2013. Among the tourist attractions in Malacca City are A Famosa, Jonker Walk, Little India, Portuguese Settlement, Stadthuys, Maritime Museum, Christ Church, Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum and Taming Sari Tower.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to legend, the site that is now Malacca City was named Malaka when Parameswara, a Sumatran prince arrived there. While he was resting under a tree known as a Malacca tree, he saw his warrior's hunting dogs were challenged and kicked into a river by a tiny mouse deer. Amused by this, he chose to name the site Malaka after the tree under which he was sitting. When the city came under Portuguese administration, its name was spelled \"Malaca\", under Dutch administration as \"Malakka\" or \"Malacka\", and under British rule, \"Malacca\". The Straits of Malacca were named after the city at the time of the Malacca Sultanate.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding of Malacca ===\n\nMalacca was established when Parameswara, who had escaped from Palembang in Sumatra, decided to build a new kingdom following Malay Srivijaya's fall in 1377 after being attacked by Javanese Majapahit. Before he reached the site, he arrived in Temasek, which he decided to make the centre of the new Malay Kingdom's administration. But when Parameswara lived there, he killed Temagi, a Regent of Singapura who served under the Siamese King to take over the throne from Temagi. Fearing further reprisals by Siam when the news reached the Siamese Kingdom, Parameswara decided to move to a new place. After he left Temasek, it was attacked by Majapahit. Parameswara then headed to the north of Malay Peninsula and arrived at Muar, where he tried to establish another new kingdom at either Biawak Busuk or Kota Buruk, but found the locations unsuitable.Parameswara continue his journey to the north, where he reportedly visited Sening Ujong (now Sungai Ujong) before arriving at a Malay fishing village at the mouth of Bertam River (now Malacca River). He decided to stop there to rest. While he was resting under a tree, he saw his follower's hunting dogs fighting with a small mouse deer before they were kicked into a river by the deer. Amused by this, he thought the place he rested must be an unusual place; following this event, in 1396 he announced the place would be called Malaka. Soon, the site became the centre of the Malay world in the 15th and 16th centuries and the most prosperous entrep\u00f4t in the Malay Archipelago. In 1403, the first official Chinese trade envoy led by Admiral Yin Qing arrived in Malacca. Later, Parame\u015bwara was escorted by Zheng He and other envoys in his successful visits. Malacca's relationships with Ming granted protection to Malacca against attacks from Siam and Majapahit and Malacca officially submitted as a protectorate of Ming China. This encouraged the development of Malacca into a major trade settlement on the trade route between China and India, Middle East, Africa and Europe. To prevent the Malaccan empire from falling to the Siamese and Majapahit, he forged a relationship with the Ming dynasty of China for protection. Following the establishment of this relationship, the prosperity of the Malacca entrep\u00f4t was then recorded by the first Chinese visitor, Ma Huan, who travelled together with Admiral Zheng He. On his descriptions, he wrote;\n\nMalacca was a well-established city surrounded by a palisade with four gates and watch towers. Inside the walled towers was a second fortification, a kind of citadel, within whose confines were the merchants' godowns, the treasury and food storehouses. The Malacca River divided the city into two almost equal halves, the southern half being the inner citadel and the ruler's compound and the northern half, reached by a bridge some distance from the river mouth, containing the residents of many foreign merchants. The bridge and its approaches comprised the main venue for all commercial kinds. Constructed on the bridge was about a score of market stalls: an easy location for small watercraft to reach with their loads of produce and also close to the docks where foreign sea-going vessels unloaded goods for transhipment.\nIn Malacca during the early 15th century, Ming China actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for treasure voyages into the Indian Ocean. Malacca had been a relatively insignificant region, not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both Ma Huan and Fei Xin, and was a vassal region of Siam. In 1405, the Ming court dispatched Admiral Zheng He with a stone tablet enfeoffing the Western Mountain of Malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country. The Chinese also established a government depot (\u5b98\u5ee0) as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers. Ma Huan reported that Siam did not dare to invade Malacca thereafter. The rulers of Malacca, such as Parameswara in 1411, would pay tribute to the Chinese emperor in person. Because of its strategic location, Malacca was an important stopping point for Zheng He's fleet. To enhance relations, Hang Li Po, according to local folklore, a daughter of the Ming Emperor of China, arrived in Malacca, accompanied by 500 attendants, to marry Sultan Manshur Shah who reigned from 1456 until 1477. Her attendants married locals and settled mostly in Bukit Cina. Due to Chinese involvement, Malacca had grown as key alternative to other important and established ports. Due to the large influence of Arab, Persian, and Indian traders, Malacca soon turned into an Islamic sultanate, and Parameswara converted to Islam when he married a princess from Pasai, changing his name to Sultan Iskandar Shah. With the rise of Melaka as an empire, both the Majapahit and Siamese kingdoms were unable to conquer it, especially with the Chinese protection. During this time, an Hindu\u2013Malay and Tamil\u2013Malay society were also formed. The Sultan died in 1414 and was succeeded by his son, Megat Iskandar Shah. Malacca continued to prosper until the eighth Sultanate of Malacca, Mahmud Shah, with the various races who came to trade becoming associated with particular trade specialties; the Gujaratis, Tamils, and Bengalis were mostly cloth merchants, the Arabs and Persians waited for their vessels to be filled with goods from China, the Chinese dealt mainly in silk, camphor, and porcelain, and the natives of Malay Archipelago, like the Bugis and other island peoples, traded mainly in spices and sandalwood, and the Minangkabau in pepper and gold, with the Javanese controlling the rice and imported foodstuffs. Like other traders, the Chinese established their own area in the city, occupying the southeast side of the port around a hill called Bukit Cina, where they constructed temples and a well called Hang Li Poh's Well, named after Hang Li Po, the fifth wife of the sixth Sultan of Malacca, Mansur Shah, who was a Chinese princess from the Ming Dynasty.\n\n\n=== European conquest ===\n\nDue to its riches, the news of the success of Malacca reached the Portuguese, who had an established presence on Indian ports. The Portuguese, under King Manuel I, sent a representative named Diogo Lopes de Sequeira to establish contact with the Sultanate. At the first, Sequeira was well received by Sultan Mahmud Shah. But the Tamil Muslim community, who already had an established presence in Malacca, convinced the Sultan to eliminate the Portuguese based on their treatment of the Muslims of Goa. Reacting to the report, Sultan Mahmud then ordered several men from the Portuguese delegation to be captured and killed, but some of them managed to escape with their ships. Thus, in April 1511 Afonso de Albuquerque, who was the Portuguese expedition leader together with his armada, arrived in Malacca to sever its Islamic and Venetian trade. His intention was described in his own words when he arrived to Malacca:\n\nIf they were only to take \"Malaca\" out of the hands of the Moors, Cairo and Mecca would be entirely ruined, and Venice would then be able to obtain no spiceries except what her merchants might buy in Portugal.\nThe Portuguese launch their first attack on 25 July 1511, but this was met with failure. Albuquerque then launched another attack on 15 August 1511, which proved successful as Malacca was captured on that day. The Portuguese constructed a fortress called A Famosa using rocks and stones taken from Muslim graves, mosques, and other buildings. Several churches and convents, a bishop's palace, and administrative buildings such as the governor's palace were built. The Portuguese imposed higher taxes on Chinese traders and restricted their ownership of land. The news of the city's capture reached the Ming Dynasty of China; the Chinese were also displeased about the kidnapping of many Chinese children by the Portuguese in Tuen Mun. In retaliation for Portugal's activity in Malacca, several Portuguese were later killed by the Chinese in the battles of Tunmen and Xicaowan in China.By the mid-16th century, the two sultanates of Aceh and Johor had arisen to take control of Malacca from the Portuguese which then became the centre of struggle between the three. By 1564, Aceh had retaken Aru (a territory which Sumatra had previously lost to Johor) and destroyed Johor's capital, Johor Lama, with the Johor royal family taken to Aceh to rule Johor as a vassal state. Other attacks were carried out in 1570, 1613, and 1623, when Johor tried to break away from Aceh. Aceh's ambition for domination later led to a clash with the Portuguese in Malacca. The two sultanates and the Portuguese became involved in a triangular war, but when both the Portuguese and the Johor saw Aceh as a threat due to its constant attacks against them, the two began to collaborate to fight Aceh. In 1582 the Portuguese assisted Johor to thwart an attack by Aceh, but arrangement ended when Johor attacked the Portuguese in 1587. Aceh continued its attacks against the Portuguese, and was later destroyed when a large additional armada from the Portuguese port in Goa came to defend Malacca and destroy the sultanate.\n\nAfter Aceh was left weakened, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) arrived, and Johor formed a treaty with them to flush out the Portuguese in the second capture of Malacca. The Dutch succeeded at overtaking Malacca while Johor managed to re-establish its suzerainty over many of its former dependencies in Sumatra, such as Siak (1662) and Indragiri (1669). The Dutch expanded the size of the city fort and built a significant amount of additional infrastructure. As they had less interest in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra than they had in Java and the Maluku Islands, the Dutch remained neutral in local disputes until 1756 when the Bugis, who ruled the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, began to threaten Dutch maritime trade. The threats increase in the 18th century, when English rivalry started to establish its presence over areas in the northern Malay Peninsula. This led the Dutch to seize the Bugis areas of Riau and expel the Bugis from both Riau and Selangor, for fearing that these areas would otherwise have fallen under British rule. Malacca was placed under the direct control of Batavia in Java.\n\nFrom 1796 until 1801, and 1807 to 1818 Malacca was temporarily placed under a British Resident as the Netherlands were conquered by France in the Napoleonic Wars. It was returned to the Dutch in 1818. Malacca served as the staging area for the British victory in 1811. A treaty was later signed in 1824 between the British and Dutch to prevent further British influence in Java; one result was that the Johor-Riau Empire fell under two colonial powers along with Malacca, which was then officially handed to the British in 1825 and integrated as part of the Straits Settlements. The city came under direct control of a Resident in Penang, and the old fort in the city was then dismantled. The British established regulations for infrastructure with the construction of, for example, back alleys, chimneys, back yards, fire escapes, fire alleys, and pedestrian arcades.\n\n\n=== World War II, post-independence and present ===\n\nDuring the first stage of World War II, the city's residents continued to live normally until the news of the Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse on 10 December 1941 reached the city and struck panic. British colonial officials began to flee and thousands of the city's residents hid in rubber estates and jungles since they heard about the acts of cruelty committed in other parts of Malaya following their conquest by the Japanese. The Japanese Army arrived in the city on 14 January 1942 in a convoy of bicycles, but as they mainly focused on ensuring the retreat of the British to the south of the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, there was no major battle in the city or other parts of Malacca. During their occupation, a kempeitai headquarters was established in the formerly British \"Government Rest House\" which served as a place for arrests, torture and executions. Those who still lived in the city were given low rice rations with a tapioca supplement and a number of them were taken to Thailand and forced to construct the Burma\u2013Siam Railway.When the Allies began to counter-attack against the Japanese, the Japanese officially surrendered to the Allies in August 1945 with the city left undamaged as there were no heavy battles, and it was administered as part of the British Military Administration until the formation of the Malayan Union and then the Federation of Malaya. After Malaya achieved its independence on 31 August 1957, a colonial building named \"Malacca Club\" was built by the British in the city as the social centre for Britons in British Malaya. The building was then turned into a memorial after 38 years to commemorate the Malayan independence day. After the Federation of Malaya, together with North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Malacca was extensively developed and in 2003 it was granted city status. On 7 July 2008, Malacca City was listed as one of the historical cities in Malaysia, together with George Town in the northern Malay Peninsula.\n\n\n== Capital city ==\n\nMalacca City is the centre of political and economic administration for the state of Malacca. There is one member of parliament (MP) representing one parliamentary constituency in the city: Kota Melaka (P.138). The city also elects five representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Kesidang, Kota Laksamana, Duyong, Bandar Hilir and Telok Mas.\n\n\n=== Local authority and city definition ===\nThe city is administered by the Malacca City Council (Majlis Bandaraya Melaka Bersejarah, MBMB). Formerly known as Malacca Municipal Council (Majlis Perbandaran Melaka Bandaraya Bersejarah, MPMBB), it was merged with the \"Malacca Municipality Area\" on 1 January 1977 with a new combined area of 114.7 square miles (303 square kilometres). Then on 15 April 2003, MPMBB was upgraded into MBMB before part of its area, covering 57.66 kilometres separated for Hang Tuah Jaya Municipal Council (MPHTJ). MBMB area is currently at 277 sq kilometres as a result of land reclamation, with a new administration area of 30.86 sq kilometres. Together these areas comprise a metropolitan area of 307.86 sq kilometres. As of 2016, the current mayor is Zainal Hussin.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city is located on both sides of the Malacca River near its mouth on the Straits of Malacca. The city is approximately 152 kilometres from Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Due to large-scale land reclamation, it has grown in size, especially in the south. Its physical features are characterised by flat and gently undulating land stretching from its coast.The historic central area of the city is located near the old coastline; it includes St Paul's Hill with the ruins of the Portuguese fortress, A Famosa and the Dutch Square on the right (eastern) bank of the river, and the old Chinatown on the left (western) bank. The Chinese Hill (Bukit Cina), where a large old Chinese cemetery is located, was formerly located to the northeast of the city, but is now surrounded by new buildings on all sides.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMalacca's weather is hot and humid throughout the year with rainfall, the intensity of which depends on the time of the year. It is one of the driest cities in Malaysia, receiving just under 2,000 mm (79 in) of rainfall while most areas in Peninsular Malaysia receive an average of around 2,500 mm (98 in) of rainfall annually. However, Malacca has no dry season as average rainfall is more than 100 mm (3.9 in) for each month. Malacca is classified as having a tropical rainforest climate (Af) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and with no cyclones so a pure equatorial climate. The relatively stable weather allows Malacca to be visited year-round. Temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) during the day and from 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) to 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) at night, although the temperature may fall after periods of heavy rainfall.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and religion ===\nThe Malaysian Census in 2010 reported the population of Malacca City was 484,885. Malays comprised the majority with 273,844, followed by Chinese with 158,828, Indian with 20,310 and others totalling 9,732. Around 22,171 were identified as a Non-Malaysian citizens. Due to a large amount of interracial marriage since the era of the Malacca Sultanate, the city features its own ethnic mixtures of Baba Nyonya, Chitty and Kristang peoples. The Majority of the Malays were Muslims, and the Chinese and Peranakan were either Buddhist, Confucianist, Taoist or followers of other Chinese folk religions. The Indians, including the Chitty, were mainly Hindus while the Kristang were mostly Christian.\nThe Baba Nyonya are Straits-born Chinese, who have resided for generations since the era of the Malacca Sultanate as traders and intermarried with the local Malay women. They adopted the local culture and the Malay language as part of their lives while at the same time preserving some of their Chinese heritage. The Chitty are also a mixture of Indian traders with local women of various ethnic backgrounds such as Malays, Javanese, Bataks and Chinese. The Kristang exist as a result of marriage between the European Portuguese men with Malay women during the era of Portuguese Malacca.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe main language spoken in the city is the Malay, although the Baba Nyonya and Chitty have their own variations of Baba and Chitties creoles respectively. The Malaccan Portuguese have their own version of Portuguese creole, known as Kristang language.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince the era of Malacca Sultanate, the city has prospered as a successful entrep\u00f4t, putting it in the same position as Venice, Cairo and Canton. When the European conquest begin, Malacca had developed into a cosmopolitan city with a long-standing European heritage. The arrival of Chinese traders and coolie during the sultanate era and European colonisation saw a large boost to the economy, especially during the administration of Dutch and the British. In modern times, the tourism is more dominant than the primary-based industry due to its historical riches with the melting pots of cultural influences which attracted many local and foreign tourists to visiting the city, which also became part of the state economy income. In addition to its strategic location in the maritime Silk Road, the city benefited from the rise of China and India as world economic powers. Malacca City has hosted numerous national, regional and international conferences, congresses and trade fairs in the Malacca International Trade Centre. In early 2016, the Malacca state government has start to develop a new economic development area in the central city centre which will be known as the Hang Tuah Trade Centre that will encompassing trade centres, higher education, hospitality and business.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Land ===\n\nInternal roads linking different parts on the city are mostly federal roads constructed and maintained by the Malaysian Public Works Department. The city is accessible through the North\u2013South Expressway and the coastal Syed Abdullah Aziz Road. There is also an old trunk road system, which once served as a main passageway to the city until the mid 1980s, when the North\u2013South Expressway was built.

          "We found the river walk a bit of a let down. There is some small interesting buildings but that's about it. The downside is the smell and rubbish alongside parts of the walk. We were not sure if it actually flowed anywhere which could be part of the smell problem.",

          "Either walk the river or take the cruise. It's not the quickest or most direct way to see things but it's worth the effort.",
          "The hotel gave us a guide and we set off along the river to explore. I would say this is a pleasant walk along a meandering river that provides some insight into the colonial past. It is certainly not the fastest way to get from A to B as the river has many curves. A drink at",
          "We took this walk on the way from our Hotel to Jonker Street. Melaka has put a lot of time and effort into cleaning up their river and this walk makes sure you see the results. I recommend this walk.",
          "There are so many paved areas to walk besides the river. It's very impressive wherever you happen to walk alongside. Near to the centre of the heritage district is the bridge crossing the river, nearby the Riverwalk has a commemoration of the landing of Zheng He with nearby",
          "Situated next to Jonker Street, this alley is really a suitable place for people who enjoy the beautiful view of Melaka old shops and Melaka river. This place is also suitable for photography as you can capture many beautiful angles of the place. The restaurant along the walkway",

          "Cafes providing drinks were set up along the waterfront, crowds of people makes it relatively safe for a romantic relaxing walk.",
          "Walking by a river is always relaxing and this also is the case in Melaka. The walk has plenty of cafes and art galleries and a very chilled out atmosphere. It is a welcome break from the hectic crowds in nearby Jonker street.",

          "The Melaka river is usually very crowded with tourist on weekends. Hence, we went to the river walk on a weekday. We started the river walk from the bridge at Little India side. On the way we saw a few monitor lizards in the water and lazing on the river stairs! You can also pay",
          "Take a stroll along the river walk either early morning or in the evening where it is not so hot. Nice hotels on the river. Historical points of interest given. 'Old' quaint buildings and shops.",
          "We did a lot of walking around the Melaka River as our hotel was just next to it. Besides observing the quaint shops and buildings, we saw plenty of monitor lizards swimming in the river and into the sewage drains. A cheap thrill for city folk. On certain days, an old man",
          "We really enjoyed walking along the river early in the morning before it gets hot and the tourist boats start up. It is very picturesque.and a quiet way to start the day. There are several restaurants with seating along the river and it makes a great way to eat lunch or dinner..",
          "Well described in the brochure to help understand the historical pionts of interest. Well signed and laid out. Watch for the mosquitos in the afternoon being beside the river!",
          "This walk would be enjoyed anytime of the day, but I really loved doing it just before sunset so that you watch the old style lights come on and view the bustle on the river. Plus you could take several stops at little eateries for local food or a drink.",
          "It is a relatively short walk with very colorful buildings. These buildings are along the river. Something to do while in Melaka.",
          "You can walk in the moonlite and hugging both of you, also whispering something untrue ha ha ha, just come here and see the beautiful scene of river, again if you tired just come to the near kiosk , plenty of kiosk or hop to hard rock cafe for style.",

          "the area around the river is teeming with cafes, boutiques, hotels, cultural centres. It is very well developed and maintained. You can walk for hours by the river and not get bored. When you get tired, just chose from one of the many cafes lining the water front, chill for some",
          "We spent several hours walking along the river taking photos. We walked down oneside of the river and back up the other. We saw water dragons along the river. The walkway was very good and well maintained and an easy walk. We stopped for a drink along the way at Tangs. There are",
          "Spend your afternoon here, good to take a walk, just before the sunset, enjoy the view, and meet other tourist.",
          "We have a good walk along the river where cafes and restaurants were found along the river side. However, cleaniless should not be neglected",

          "We went there in the afternoon and it is way too hot to walk along the river. During night time, we passed by again and it is much relaxing than earlier.",
          "Loved this walk. I took photos all the way along the river. There is so much to see and so many nice murals along the way. It is a lovely, peaceful walk and not many people interupting your photo taking. I highly recommend you take the time to walk along the river; you will not",
          "We really enjoyed our walk, looking at the small shops, drinking a fresh juice or water at the little cafes. Little bridges add more charm to the picture perfect photo shots. Otherwise, nothing else to do in Melaka, at least for us.",
          "One of the nicer parts of Melaka! Walk along the river and see the sights and sounds of old town Melaka. You can feel yourself going back in time to the colonial days as you walk past old buildings along the river. The water is rather clean and does not smell.",
          "The melaka river has great development compare to 10 years ago. Government has put a lot of efforts and money to develop this \"famous and tourists super love attraction\". Shops, cafes, hotels are everywhere along the river. Unfortunately, the river water still very stinky.",
          "Once you leave a main street and get to the riverfront this beautifully walk is very refreshing, quiet with views you cannot see from street sides. You can catch or watch the river cruises plying the water, or an occasional police boat speeding by. We walked past two bridges on",
          "Take a stroll along the river walk. Enjoy your view and say cheese...to the river boat rides that passes by! Enjoy the sunsets and you can choose any cafes along the river walk and have a coffee or beer. Spot the river lizards if you can!",

          "I had a wonderful walk along the entire river from Stadthuys right up to Kg. Morten and back. Among the best river walkways I had done. It is clean, safe and lots of old Melaka to see, and away from the annoying traffic. You can even venture out into modern shopping malls, or",
          "A very relaxing activity that suitable for all age. It is one of the best way to explore and enjoy the charming part of Melaka and also away from vehicle's noise. There are many access to the river walk and you can explore many unique bridges, wall art, caf\u00e9, traditional houses",

          "We stayed in a hotel along the river so this was our main route to getting anywhere. The river smells may not be the most pleasant but it didn't spoil our experience. Plenty of little cafes and bars with al fresco seating so you can sit and wave to the passengers on the river",
          "A lovely relaxing area to have a slow walk or cycle with your partner/friends. While the water itself does not look perfectly clean, the environment is still nice enough to enjoy on a cooling afternoon.",
          "Much work has gone into making the river walk clean and attractive. River still pongs. So far we've walked from the Jonker precinct up to the Shore - both sides, day and night. A great collection of bridges to walk under, over or around. We've seen that the walk goes much",
          "We didn't walk the whole way along the river as we had our 2.5year old in tow, but the short distance we did was fantastic. Very cool graffiti and paintings on the buildings. Best to go early or just before sun down as it's very hot during the day. Very worth the walk. Just be",
          "The road is narrow but there are not a lot of tourist walking around. There are some nice coffee shop along the river and I feel sorry that I do not have much time to sit down and drink a cap of coffee.",
          "Beautifully restored and newly built walkways and cafe/venues along the Towns River. Always well kept and clean.. the area is transformed at night into a lively open arena for eateries and bars. With River cruises meandering by.. its both tranquil and lively.. a strange mix that",
          "Deserve to be World Heritage Central!!! Lose from the noisy city to Melaca. Best place to relax, take time to walk along the riverside and take the photos of old city.",
          "We had a nice stroll along the river, enjoying the view that has been improved & upgraded. It was better to it in the morning, rather than in the afternoon. We did it again in the evening & it was nicer. A must do if you are in Melaka for the 1st time.",
          "I spent 2 hours walking on both sides of the river. It is best to take this walk late in the afternoon or early in the morning. From 11 am the heat will be draining on your energy. The old momrail structure can be seen all the way around. Near the Swiss Hotel we can see an old",
          "Lots of shops and historical places around the river. Check out the spot where the prince saw the mousedeer and named this place Meleka. Water is quite dirty though and silt deposits have made the river not suitable for large boats that it used to served hundreds of years ago.",
          "I wouldn't miss the cruise for the world. But it should be done in the evening to marvel at the lights and the sound. The cafes at the bays are well lit and alive. Taking the cruise gives one a wondrous feeling that is difficult to explain.",
          "We had an hour to kill after our Baba Nyonya set lunch and wanted to walk off a few of the calories consumed, so we opted to climb down to the footpath running alongside the Melaka River and follow the route of the boat trip we'd taken a few hours earlier. Walking gave us the",
          "This boardwalk could be so great if the water didn't wreak of sewerage and have tons of trash and floating dead fish in it.",
          "Nice old buildings along the river. Restaurants, cafes and some shops. We stayed at the Majestic and just walked East from the sea on the south side which has the best views but will walk both directions next time.",
          "At all times of day it's a nice walk but I would recommend going in the early evening so as to observe the changing shades from the setting sun. It's cooler and relatively quiet despite the occasional passing river tour. At night there are colourful lights that run all along the",
          "This place has definitely cleaned up a lot since a few years ago. There is a decent walkway next to the river where you will find some cafes, hotels and plenty of murals. Some modern, some depicting the history of this city. A very pleasant walk that anyone can do. Just remember",

          "A morning or evening walk is a delightful thing to do here. A walk at night is also pleasant, if not romantic, along the stretch near the city centre. The walk is well-kept; kudos to the local government. Keep it up!",

          "This is my favorite activity when I was in Melaka.....a walk in the morning and in the afternoon...after my melaka river crusie I walked for just about 30 minutes from Melaka river cruise station to my guesthouse...... Maybe an added architectural element in the riverside will",
          "The walk is a easy to navigate, purpose-built causeway along and over the river. It has been attractively executed, with interesting murals and plants. There are also places to eat, drink and watch the world go by.",
          "Nice place to take pictures and the river do stink a lil but not all the time when I visited. During the night, the view is nicer.",
          "Quiet evening weak, around 6pm to 730pm would be nice, as shops still open to see and Sun would be cooler then the afternoon walks.",
          "From the centre of Melaka, by the side of the Hard Rock restaurant, you can walk along the river side and enjoy the various buildings along its bank. A pleasant walk",
          "you can hop onto the rivere cruise or walk along several kilometres along this river with sweeping views, beautiful river breeze and many sites to see.",
          "It was lovely to walk by the river almost everyday. Cooler air and clean and safe place to walk with kids.",
          "You can walk upriver by the water even for 6 kilometres so don't let the abandonded buildings at the beginning in Chinatown discourage you. The water doesn't smell that bad so some of the small rowhouses operate as B&B and when advancing by the curwy river you will see high end",
          "If you have spare bucks, can try the River Cruise at night. It's quite beautiful especially with those graffiti on the side walls of the buildings. Quite relaxing.",
          "It was an impromptu visit when we got time to spare. At weekend Malacca is super crowded. I find the river walk as a free-hussle spot, I'm glad that i walk far enough to get the quite spot.",
          "The walk alongside the Malacca River was actually not a very nice experience. I just couldn't stand the very bad smell from the river, the hot and warm weather with no wind blowing.",
          "Kudos to the Malacca Govt for doing this re development. Brings a lot of tourism activity. Pleasant to walk here when its not hot and humid. Recommend it for late evening/ night walks",
          "my suggestion is to do this at night coz it's more comfortable and the view is nicer at night with all those lights surrounding",
          "Talking a walk by the river, better on Jonker street side, is really relaxing and appealing. The river bank is almost empty with very few people except for some tourist enjoying a drink by the river. Some of the buildings carry some nice street art murals as well as some cafe's",
          "Yes, you can take a boat trip but why? You would miss so much, the colourful plants, the painted buildings, the views of the city at each twist and turn. At night, the riverside and bridges light up in a kaleidoscope of colour.",
          "Walking along the river in Melaka is definitely one of my favourite pastimes. The Melaka Government had done a great job by beautifying the river and building good pavement along the river. It is a nice experience to walk around the river in the evening or early morning when the",
          "Rivers often attract crowds, but here we had the riverside to ourselves. Lined with traditional houses on one side and a variety of landscaping projects on the other, one could stroll for some distance. In the evening, coloured lighting makes a very appealing scene.",
          "Experinece yourself by walking along river walk. Very budget hotel along, you can see locals culture and arts from the murals painted on the building. Don't miss pirate park to get on pirate ship. You also can enjoy river cruise and have your picture taken as a souvenir. Its",
          "The boat ride gives you a quick tour along the river. I suggest you take two rides, one at day time and the other at night. You will see different views of its charm. After the boat ride, take a stroll along the river bank to enjoy the breeze, discover the thrills and scenery",
          "We didn't take a boat ride up the river but strolled along it never the less. Colourful cafes, bars, and art shops tucked into every nook and cranny. Delightful and easy to walk.",
          "The Melaka River meanders through the town before it discharges its water into the sea. The river is clean and the old kampungs have been demolished. Now hotels and shopping malls run parallel to the river. It is exhilarating to walk along the river side in the morning or the",
          "take a walk along the river ( better at the afternoon ) , many things to see , old building , cafe , and also trash and the worst is some part of the river smells bad (sewer smell)",
          "we have a walk at here, its si bad that we can see a lot of rubbish along our walk. its really need a maintenance",
          "This area has been so overhauled that it feels exactly like walking round a theme park rather than a real town. No sense of history here. River is quite smelly too. Nice enough for 20 mins at night I guess but that's about it.",
          "Loved walking down the lanes next to the river. There are quirky shops, homes, restaurants, interesting buildings that you get to see. Some sections have some fascinating street art.",
          "Loved walking along the riverwalk...passing by quaint cafes, seeing the murals up close, but occasionally we would get a whiff of sewage...not nice. I think this has the potential to be a truly wonderful part of town.",

          "Nice walking path but for the the adults only, not recommended for kids as the walkway is really close to the riverbank. Good effort for making it alive with those motels,eating spots and murals.",
          "Unfortunately there is not enough businesses to turn their riverwalk to an exciting location. That makes this path to be a sheer walking path under the sun. The water is not particular clean. However, taking a river boat ride could be a nice outing by night a great way to escape",
          "This is one of the activities that kills two birds with one stone. It is a nice walk along the riverside and see the historic part of city from a different perspective as well to get some exercise. The river is clean and the paths on both sides are well maintained. The view at",

          "Nice view, nice scene, nice roadside food, only if the whether is right. Of course it is not going to be nice for rainy days but even if sunny, sometimes it can be very hot that you will just want to run away. The river ride is recommended.",

          "The river walk is beautifully kept with gardens and pot palnts all the way along. Many opt for the river boat cruise but I walked all the way through to the bus station hub. Easy walking for those with prams as well. My favourite part of this quaint city.",
          "The shops open in the afternoon and you can enjoy beer next to the river after walking around the town.",

          "We arrived very early morning day. Just after sunrise. Wrong time. The view was great. Melaka river was very clean, made me want to jump into the river. There are many historical sites around the riverside. I suggest you to try the ice cream stall near on the riverside.",
          "Great outdoor activity. You can jog, walk or both here as it offers unique views of different sides of Malacca, a-la Venice canals.. A night walk would offer better views, really peaceful.",

          "This pathway would be a memorable ones if you choose to walk in the late evening as the weather would not be hot. A lot of choices of delicacies that can be enjoyed while walking. My favorite is potato spring style fried and coconut water.",
          "Interesting to see all the different establishment along the river and it's a good way to avoid the excitement of traffic roulette on the main roads but a general lack of maintenance has led to some of the wooden sections being somewhat less secure than was probably intended.",
          "Really interesting but frustrating because you have to keep leaving the river and going back up to the road",
          "I love this Riverwalk because there are many wall art along this walk. The road is clean, not so crowded, and the view is pretty cool. You can see the Malacca River Boat too from here.",
          "Good to take a walk or a jog or a run during the mornings and evenings. The State Government has put in lots of money to beautify the river and its surrounding streching a few kilometers long. You may want to enjoy a boat ride, too.",

          "There was actually nothing much other than walking along a small and not so clean river. It was actually like walking at the back lane of buildings and in the afternoon, it could get very warm. The smell of the river was a bit overpowering. After taking some photos, we just",

        "wiki": "Sentosa Island, known mononymously as Sentosa, is an island located off the southern coast of Singapore's main island. The island is separated from the main island of Singapore by a channel of water, the Keppel Harbour, and is adjacent to Pulau Brani, a smaller island wedged between Sentosa and the main island.\nFormerly used as a British military base and then a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, the island was renamed Sentosa and was planned to be a popular tourist destination. It is now home to a popular resort that receives more than twenty million visitors per year. Attractions include a 2 km (1.2 mi) long sheltered beach, Madame Tussauds Singapore, Kidzania, an extensive Cable Car network, Fort Siloso, two golf courses, 14 hotels and the Resorts World Sentosa, which features the Universal Studios Singapore theme park and one of Singapore's two casinos, the other being Marina Bay Sands.\nSentosa is also widely known as being the location of the 2018 North Korea\u2013United States Singapore Summit, where North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump met at the Capella Hotel located on the island. This was the first-ever meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the United States.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Sentosa translates as \"peace and tranquility\" in Malay, which was in turn derived from the Sanskrit term Santosha, meaning \"contentment, satisfaction\". Sentosa was formerly known as Pulau Blakang Mati\nwhich in Malay means the \"Island of Death Behind\".The name Blakang Mati is old; an island was identified as Blacan Mati in Manuel Godinho de Er\u00e9dia's 1604 map of Singapore. Other early references to the island of Blakang Mati include Burne Beard Island in Wilde's 1780 MS map, Pulau Niry, Nirifa from 1690 to 1700, and the nineteenth century reference as Pulau Panjang (J.H. Moor). However, early maps did not separate Blakang Mati from the adjacent island of Pulau Brani, so it is uncertain to which island the seventeenth century place names referred.\nThe island has changed name several times. Up to 1830, it was called Pulau Panjang (\"long island\"). In an 1828 sketch of Singapore Island, the island is referred to as Po. Panjang. According to Bennett (1834), the name Blakang Mati was only given to the hill on the island by the Malay villagers on the island. The Malay name for this island is literally translated as \"dead back\" or \"behind the dead\"; blakang means \"at the back\" or \"behind\" or \"after\"; mati means \"dead\". It is also called the \"dead island\" or the \"island of the dead\" or perhaps \"island of after death\".\nDifferent versions of how the island came to acquire such an unpropitious name abound:\n\nOne account attributed the ominous name to murder and piracy in the island's past.\nA second claimed that the island is the material paradise for the spirits of warriors said to have been buried at Pulau Brani.\nA third account claims that an outbreak of disease on the island in the late 1840s almost wiped out the original Bugis settlers on the island. Dr Robert Little, a British coroner investigating the deaths, stumbled upon what was called Blakang Mati Fever, purportedly a type of fever caused by miasmastic fumes arising from decaying leaves and swampy water on the island. This led to a controversy in medical circles at that time as to the causes of this disease.  The disease was later recognised in 1898 as malaria spread by the Anopheles mosquito. The government's malaria research station was originally located here.\nA fourth interpretation is that \"dead back island\" was so-called because of the lack of fertile soil on the hills. However, since the island creates an area of dead water behind it with no wind (hence \"still behind\" - still or stopped being an alternative translation of mati) it may be as simple as this \u2014 less romantic perhaps, but believable from a nautical viewpoint.\nIn 1827, Captain Edward Lake of the Bengal Engineer Group in his report on public works and fortifications had proposed an alternative name for Blakang Mati as the \"Island of St George\". However, the island was seen as too unhealthy for habitation and his proposed name was never realised.\n\nIn a 1972 contest organised by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board, the island was renamed Sentosa, a Malay word meaning \"peace and tranquility\", from Sanskrit, Santosha.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early period ===\nPulau Blakang Mati was once home to the native Malays who were relocated to the mainland, together with the Pulau Brani villagers, due to urban redevelopment in the late 1970s. In the nineteenth century, the island was considered important because it protected the passage into Keppel Harbour. Plans to fortify the island as part of the defence plan for Singapore were drawn up as early as 1827, but few fortifications actually materialised until the 1880s, when the rapid growth of the harbour led to concern over the protection of coal stocks against enemy attack. The four forts built on the island were Fort Siloso, Fort Serapong, Fort Connaught and the Mount Imbiah Battery.The western end of Pulau Belakang Mati, the place where Fort Siloso is now, used to be called sarang rimau (the tiger's den). Selusuh is a kind of herb used as a remedy in childbirth, but there is no explanation of how the fort came to be so called, the orang laut of Kampong Kopit only knowing the place by the name of sarang rimau. By the 1930s, the island was heavily fortified and a crucial component of Fortress Singapore, and the base of the Royal Artillery.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nDuring the Second World War, the island was a British military fortress. The British set up large-calibre gun fortifications at various points along the island that were aligned  to the south, facing the sea in expectation of a seaward Japanese assault. The myth that the guns were incapable of pointing north developed after the War but this was wrong, they could swivel to point north but they were only equipped with armour-piercing shells for ships which made the shells ineffective against land based forces. The Japanese invaded and captured Singapore from the north, after having done the same to Malaya (now known as West or Peninsular Malaysia).\nFollowing the surrender of the Allied Forces on 15 February 1942, Fort Siloso became a prisoner of war camp, housing Australian and British prisoners of the Japanese. During the Japanese Occupation, under the Sook Ching Operation, Chinese men who were suspected, often arbitrarily, of being involved in anti-Japanese activities were brutally killed. 300 bodies, riddled with bullet wounds, washed up on the beach of Pulau Belakang Mati, and were buried by the British prisoners.\n\n\n=== 1945\u201372 ===\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender in 1945 and the return of Singapore to British rule, the island became the base of the locally enlisted First Singapore Regiment of the Royal Artillery (1st SRRA) in 1947. Other locally enlisted men from Singapore were sent to the island for basic military training before being sent to other units of the British Army in Singapore. Ten years later, the 1st SRRA was disbanded and its guns dismantled. The coast artillery was replaced with Gurkha infantry units, first the 2/7th Duke of Edinburgh's own Gurkha Rifles and later the 2/10th Princess Mary's own Gurkha Rifles. Fort Siloso and Mount Imbiah became a religious retreat and a Protestant church house respectively. Fort Connaught was left in ruins. Fort Serapong became a secure communications and listening station.\nIn the early 1960s, during the Indonesian Confrontation, the 2/10th occupied the island. Even though Indonesia was in close proximity there were few amateurish attempts of direct action by the Indonesians against Singapore, . The Gurkha battalion rotated on a six monthly basis to Borneo where most military action during Confrontation took place. A significant parade took place on the island during Confrontation to announce the award of the Victoria Cross to Rambahadur Limbu for an action in Borneo.  With the end of the Confrontation in 1966 and the withdrawal of the Gurkha battalion from the island, the British handed over Sentosa to the Singapore Armed Forces of the newly independent Government of Singapore in 1967. In 1967, Pulau Blakang Mati became the base for the Singapore Naval Volunteer Force, which relocated there from its old base at Telok Ayer Basin. The School of Maritime Training was also set up there, as was the first Naval Medical Centre. It became part of the Republic of Singapore Navy. Also in 1967, Pulau Blakang Mati became the military base for the School Of Field Engineers, which relocated there from Pasir Leba Camp. The Field Engineer School trained the 1st Batch of Combat Engineer Commanders who in turn trained the 1st batch of Full Time National Servicemen who were enlisted in 1968. The 1st operational Combat Engineer Battalion was also raised here. The Engineer Headquarters (EHQ) was established here 1970 before moving to Gillman Camp in 1971.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nIn the late 1960s, the government began to set out proposals for developing the island, and a contest to find a new name for the island was held in November 1969. The island was renamed \"Sentosa\" in September 1970, which means peace and tranquility in Malay (from Sanskrit, Santosha), from a suggestion by the public. In March 1971, the government announced plans to develop the island into a holiday resort for local visitors and tourists, and a S$124-million plan for developing Sentosa was unveiled in March 1972.The Sentosa Development Corporation was formed and incorporated on 1 September 1972 to oversee the development of the island. Since then, some S$420 million of private capital and another S$500 million of government funds have been invested to develop the island.In 1974 the Singapore Cable Car system was built, linking Sentosa to Mount Faber. Finally, in 1975, the Republic of Singapore Navy had moved out from the Sentosa to Pulau Brani Island. A series of attractions were subsequently opened for visitors including Fort Siloso, Surrender Chamber wax museum, Musical Fountain, and the Underwater World. The causeway bridge was opened in 1992 connecting Sentosa to the mainland.The Sentosa Monorail system was opened in 1982 to transport visitors across seven stations located around the western side of the island.\n\n\n=== 1989 ===\nThe former political prisoner and Nobel prize nominee Chia Thye Poh spent three-and-a-half years in internal exile on Sentosa after he was freed from 23 years in jail in 1989.\n\n\n=== 2005 ===\nOn 16 March 2005, the monorail service was discontinued to make way for the new Sentosa Express, which commenced operations on 15 January 2007. An environmental assessment conducted by the government of Singapore concluded that the construction of an integrated resort on Sentosa would result in a high likelihood of high scale biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, soil erosion and climate change, as well as several other destructive ecological impacts. Therefore, over two hundred trees and plants from the area that was to be cleared for the construction of the resorts were replanted elsewhere on the island to minimize negative environmental impact.In 2009, construction of a new foot bridge began. The S$70 million Sentosa Boardwalk includes themed gardens, shops and eateries. There are covered walkways and travellators along the boardwalk for rainy days. The Boardwalk, officially opened by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on 29 January 2011, provides visitors with an alternative mode of travel to reach the island. Sentosa Boardwalk, designed by Aedas, was named Best Leisure Architecture in Asia Pacific and 5* Best Leisure Architecture in Singapore, at this year's Asia Pacific Property Awards.\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nThe island hosted the 2018 North Korea\u2013United States summit between the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea on 12 June 2018, at the Capella Hotel. Sentosa island was gazetted as a 'special event area' by the Singapore Government and the Capella Hotel was chosen as the venue by the White House, a week prior to the summit.In his 2018 autobiography, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong revealed that, when the tourism sector was suffering, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew made an attempt to allow a nudist resort to be built on Sentosa in order to attract tourists, but the motion was ultimately vetoed.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe island has an area of close to 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi). It lies just half a kilometre (a quarter of a mile) away from the southern coast of the main island of Singapore. It is Singapore's fourth-largest island (excluding the main island). 70% of the island was covered by secondary rainforest, the habitat of monitor lizards, monkeys, peacocks, parrots as well as other native fauna and flora, also, when the construction of Resorts World Sentosa commenced; environmental impact was kept at a minimum when over two hundred trees in the designated area were replanted elsewhere on the island.\nFurther development has significantly impacted the biodiversity of the island, resulting in the loss of much of the native fauna and flora. The island also has a 3.2 km (2.0 mi) stretch of white sand beach, which has impacted the reef. Significantly large portions of land are currently being added to Sentosa due to land reclamation.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nSentosa can be reached from the Singapore mainland via a short causeway or Cable Car, which originates from Mount Faber and passes through HarbourFront en route to its final destination at Imbiah Lookout. In 2015, Sentosa opened an intra-island Cable Car to facilitate travelling within the island. Dubbed the sky network, the Cable Car has 3 stations, in Siloso, Imbiah and near the now-closed Merlion, and is not linked to the original Cable Car.\nPublic bus services are available to connect Sentosa Island to the mainland. Tong Tar Transport service RWS8 operates between VivoCity/ HarbourFront station to Resorts World Sentosa. SMRT Express Bus Services 188R and 963R operates between Choa Chu Kang and Woodlands respectively Resorts World Sentosa on weekends and public holidays. On 30 June 2017, SBS Transit Bus Service 123 was extended to enhance connectivity to Resorts World Sentosa, Merlion Tower (now closed) and Beach Station Bus Terminal.\nThe island is also accessible by the Sentosa Express monorail, which replaced the old Sentosa Monorail that operated from 1982 to 2005. The Sentosa Express has three stations on Sentosa and one on mainland Singapore. The northern terminus of the line, which opened on 15 January 2007, is located at the VivoCity shopping mall on the mainland and the southernmost terminus, Beach Station, is located on Sentosa Island. In Vivocity, the mainland MRT is in turn served by the HarbourFront of the North East Line and the Circle Line.\nWithin Sentosa there are three bus services, identified as Bus A ,Bus B and Bus C.Bus C Duplicates Bus A's service entierley but operating\nSince 1998, passenger cars have been allowed to enter the island.\nVisitors can also access the island via the Sentosa Boardwalk which is parallel to the causeway (which opened on 29 January 2011). The first two days of its opening were marked with free entry into Sentosa for visitors who walk, and subsequently a SGD 1 admission fee into Sentosa is charged. From 7 June 2014 to 4 January 2015, walk-in entry into Sentosa via the Sentosa Boardwalk is free on weekends and public holidays. Walk-in has been free of charge since the end of SG50 celebrations. The Sentosa Boardwalk hosts frequent bazaars on weekends.\nSentosa Beach Tram is a tram which serves Palawan Beach, Siloso Beach and Tanjong Beach, using four vehicles including 2 Volvo B12BLEAs, in which second carriage is an open top and another one with green and blue liveries. The Volvo B12BLEAs were manufactured by ComfortDelGro Engineering bodywork. The connection is at Beach Station.\nAn Autonomous Bus Trial was also conducted in mid 2019 to end 2019.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\n\n==== Operating attractions ====\nSentosa offers a variety of attractions, museums and other facilities. These include Universal Studios and Madame Tussauds chain of attractions, as well as a Marine Life Park, which consists of a water park and an aquarium. Most of the attractions on Sentosa are located in either Resorts World Sentosa, Imbiah Lookout, or the Sentosa Beachfront.\n\nThe Royal Albatross is a unique 47m class A luxury Tall Ship (pirate ship) that is berthed behind the SEA Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa. The ship has 4 masts, 22 sails and is the largest charter yacht in Singapore, with a capacity of 149 passengers. It is owned and operated by Tall Ship Adventures Pte Ltd and can be chartered by the hour or day for private and corporate events. The company also sell tickets for short cruises via their website.

          "i paid RM15 to get into this museum, but i felt like i could learn more about Cheng Ho in my Chinese history lesson than this place. There were lots of exhibits, but they didn't come in a coherent theme. This museum is about Cheng Ho, but there were also other items that were",
          "This museum showcases the exploits of the Chinese naval expeditions in 1400-1500 and the importance of Melaka as a port in the strait. After watching a short movie in the theatre we were left to wander through the museum to see the artifacts. Lots of reading required from the",
          "A lot of information and displays in this museum, but the air conditioners need to be turned on to provide ventilation to the visitors. 1. This is a ticket-entry museum. Locals and international visitors are charged differently. Locals need to show the IC to get the RM5/entry",
          "Was at the museum today. Tucked at the edge of Jonker street, entrance painted red, can\u2019t miss it. A treasure filled with artifacts and models of the travels of Zheng He or Cheng Ho a moslem Chinese who led the Chinese navy more massive than any European expedition at that time.",
          "Lots of artefacts and visual board for your to read to learn in this 3 storey building. We only we up to the first floor. No guided tour available. Still lots to see if you are a history bug.",
          "This museum is informative and puts into perspective the seven voyages of Admiral Cheng Ho of the Ming Dynasty. The tour starts with a film chronologizing his voyages, You are then left to explore the two floors filled with antiques, porcelain pots, artifacts, documents, maps",
          "Cheng Ho was a chinese Ming Dynasty admiral who visited Melaka while en route to the Western Ocean from 1405-1433. The museum showcases many evidence of cultural exchange between the local ethnic and the Chinese, among others, treasure ships, tea houses and other navigation",
          "Wow - how informative and eye opening as to how the Chinese were far more advanced than anyone else in terms of colonialist expansion. Traveling with a fleet of tens of thousands of people required significant logistical planning - food alone (growing vegetables/fruits on board",
          "I think the museum seems to be due for a re-work. It is informative. It will also be more helpful if the walking flow can be better to narrate the historical events better. My kids did enjoy the museum in general.",

          "Entrance fees were RM10 for each adult. It was interesting although the video was in Mandarin, with no English subtitles. All exhibits, fortunately, had English placards/explanations. We learnt a lot about the history of Admiral Cheng Ho. It was really interesting.",

          "Frankly I didn't expect much after I paid RM 10 to go in. It was worth every cent of it after going through the exhibits and recorded video. It pays to understand Mandarin as the English translation is just a summary, not a complete text translation. Just cannot imagine an",

          "No concrete proof that Cheng Ho himself ever landed in Melaka. This museum is not authentic at all. Give it a miss. Save your money.",
          "Some excellent exhibits and the background (Chinese emperors etc) was very useful. English labels leave a lot to be desired. This should shake European visitors' faith in what school history lessons taught them about 1492.",

          "The museum is dedicated to Cheng Ho a chinese explorer and contains items related to the chinese culture and the chinese sea expeditions. The museum is located near the famous Jonker street and is definitely worth a visit if your interested in history. The items on display range",
          "We visited the Cheng Ho Cultural Museum on a day trip from Kuala Lumpur and unfortunately we could only spend an hour there, we could have easily extended the visit to two or three hours. There is much to see and read. The museum is located in a two story shop house, one street",
          "The small and insignificant facade certainly belies the wonderful artifacts and history inside the museum. Little is known about the treasure ships of Admiral Cheng Ho since all records of the trips were destroyed by the succeeding emperor in China. You will certainly come to",
          "What an extremely informative history of someone who must be the world's greatest explorer. A brilliantly laid out and informative history of Cheng Ho with easy to read notices, good exhibits, showing how he explored the world and influenced Asia. One of the best museums I",
          "This is a great little museum. For some reason, Cheng Ho has been left out of the history books in the USA. He was quite the explorer. Loved the fact he wasn't a conqueror, rather a trader. Melaka is a great city to visit to see what happens when cultures collide....This",
          "You start off with a video clip to explain the life of cheng ho and what he did and explored. This gave you a bit of historical background. After which you are on your own to explore the 2 storeys of monuments inside this museum. A lot to see but will be better if they can have",
          "Nice place to spend and hour or so, maybe good if it is raining. There are models of National dress and a cutaway house of typical Malay that was interesting. The upper floor had a collection of old money used in the area. Some hands on things for the kids.",
          "A museum packed with exhibits and information on history, culture, etc. There is a large variety of subjects and themes, including quite amazing models of ships and re-constructions of voyage scenes and landscapes. The broad collection has many artefacts and you could spend much",
          "An interesting place to wander around and learn more about Admiral Zheng He (Chang Ho) and his trips. There are lots of other exhibits relating to those years too. We have been to see the huge boatyard in Nanjing, China where the fleet was built. The replica junk that we saw and",
          "Situated behind right behind Stadthuys, unfortunately it was close on a Friday. Really looking forward to visiting Cheng Ho museum. There is a parking in the area, entrance near the foothill, do look for it. Will definitely go again.",
          "Went for a school trip and we had a guide bring us through the entire museum which was perfect since there were too many of us students to read any signboards. She explained everything with great amount of detail and even showed us a bit of a documentary about the great Cheng",
          "Several years ago I read the book by Gavin Menzies, 1421: The Year China Discovered the World (2002). I was fascinated, and only I was sorry to read as academic critics had radically criticized the book's leading idea. In essence - the critics observe - there is overwhelming",
          "There is so much info and stuff in here, you could spend a whole day looking around (I almost did). From history of Cheng Ho and the Great Fleet to other interesting exhibits about the general history of the other close asian nations. I can actually not rate this museum high",
          "This museum is built on Admiral Cheng Ho's Guan Chang (loosely translated to warehouse). The museum houses the relics excavated from the site itself and provides a comprehensive documentation of Cheng Ho's 7 sea voyages. The displays offer insights to how Melaka and the rest of",

          "I went into the museum with my sister and cousin (our ages range from 19 - 23). There weren't enough of us to form a tour group as it was the day after a busy long weekend in Malaysia however my sister asked the lady there to perhaps share a few words with us about the museum",
          "If you wish to know the history of Admiral Cheng Ho this is the place to visit. Even though you have to pay a minimal fee, it is worth it. There will be a guide to bring you around and astound you with the rich history. They have loads of antiques in there, a small theatre for",
          "I didn't even know this man existed. Now I do, thanks to the museum and I know about all the Chinese maritime exploits of the 15th century and perhaps before. Happy I went there. Don't forget to watch the introductory video. He also had a big role in the growth of Melaka and",
          "Good place to learn about Cheng Ho and how he came to Melaka, place is air conditioned, and located at Jonker street, therefore very accessible to public",
          "It's a nice and very informative museum. You can learn a lot of facts about Cheng Ho and the history of Melaka. If you are spending more than a day in Melaka, I would suggest you give it a try.",
          "Very informative to learn about the amazing travels of admiral Zheng He's expeditions in early 1400's. It dwarfs Columbus expeditions later in the century. The museum could be in better upkeep and air-conned. Don't miss the short video near the entrance (this room has air-con).",
          "There were a lot of exhibits and I learnt some facts of Cheng Ho that i didn't know about and the place is very nice.",

This is a private museum which has a very good collection of artefacts of that era including many Ming Dynasty porcelain artworks. Part of its building is modelled on\u912d\u548c ship and has multiple decks. An adult",
          "I was really surprised that this museum was so empty when we visited there. The whole time we were there, it was just the three of us. There is so much to see and just fascinating to learn about Cheng Ho, an admiral and explorer in the Ming Dynasty. He had done so much in",
          "This place was very near to our guesthouse and after having breakfast we headed out to check this museum....please do not forget to eat and go as its huge and grand and takes up lot of time and energy but its totally worth it.after taking the entry ticket we were let in to this",
          "This is the largest Cheng Ho Museum in the world. It contains the full history of Adm Cheng Ho - his life, voyages, accomplishments, relations with China, how he managed his fleet of 208 vessels and 28,700 staff and soldiers. If you can spend at least 4 hours there, that is",
          "Good museum and very interesting, with lots to look at and see, it takes quite a while to get around the place but well worth a visit",
          "You will find the place much bigger than it appears to be. The narrow shop front is 'disguising'! We spent hours appreciating the large collections of artefacts, reading information and seeing a documentary film on the premises. The lady guide Shirley was wonderful! Not only has",
          "It is always awe-inspiring to visualize through artifacts how people lived, in this case, 600+ years ago. Initially, I thought there was too much detail but then my wonder grew. Regardless of whether his ships were quite that long (it is debated), they were huge and I didn't",
          "I did not go to the actual museum but there is a cafe behind it. For a small donation of around 5-10 MYR you can get the owner to give you a brief history of Cheng Ho. He also allows you access to the rooftop, which is at the 4 floor. From this point, you are above the old city",
          "If you are a history buff, then this will be the place for you! Unfortunately there's no English guided tour but there's descriptions at the side of artifacts . They have quite a large collection of artifacts stored in the old houses. A good opportunity to look at the",
          "It's great to visit this museum, quite informative and attractive. They also provide you with a video clip to understand the History about admiral Cheng Ho better. But nothing much to see, good information though.",
          "The guide attempted to make things interesting, but i was left wondering at the end whether i could have used the 1 hour time spent at the museum more wisely. The museum basically explains the story of Cheng Ho, a famous eunuch from the Ming dynasty, and his life story. The",
          "I visited this museum with my family on 23 Dec 2015. This is arguably one of the most bizarre but fascinating museums I've ever visited! After we had paid the admission fee, we were ushered by a staff into a small room and shown a Chinese documentary on the achievements of",

          "A good and informative place to visit for more history about Laksamana Cheng Ho. Good place for kids for better understanding of history. Value for money",
          "We stumbled upon this museum quite by chance and found it to be fascinating. It is crammed with historical fact, tremendous replicas, interesting stories, great models all displayed in a non-pretentious way. My wife and I wandered through room after room and left feeling that",
          "I never need knew Admiral came with 240 vessels and 28000 soldiers. The guide (also give commentaries even when there is only two of us. ) has good knowledge of history and speaks both Mandarin and English. Now I know why nyonya are such great cooks.",
          "My husband paid and walked through the museum. He said some information was very informative, specially the 3 wells digger by Cheng Ho.",
          "Our in-house guide Mr.Jimmy was wonderful with kids. We had a great time listening to him! Keep up the great work.",
          "Very detailed about Admiral Cheng Ho's life. Learnt many historical facts not found in books. Would be great if the video had English subtitles.",
          "A great place for knowledge and to learn about the sea voyages of the Chinese in the early 14th century. An entrance fee is required and it is worth it. The museum is well planned and laid out with a detailed history of the sea farers and the trading industry between China and",
          "This is a museum dedicated to Admiral Cheng Ho of the Ming Dynasty and his voyages from 1405 to 1433. The museum sits on the site of a warehouse built by Cheng Ho 600 years ago. The displays puts into perspective his voyages with Chinese history. A drum and bell tower flanks the",
          "Quite a large museum with some great exhibits - large displays of the chinese fleet and their impact on asian countries when they travelled. Cheng Ho (Zheng He) was a muslim and influenced the countries he visited",
          "Not knowing very much about Chinese history or the influence in Melaka, this was museum was a interesting historical insight. Spent about an hour inside and enjoyed reading about the culture.",
          "The narrative tour was an eye opener for me. Having heard of Admiral Zheng He, but I did not know of the history and the role he played in opening up China to the rest of the world through his magnificent fleet. Amazing!",
          "nothing much to see. Enjoyed the other food and curio shops along the same street better. Good just to pop by for a quick look. Don't expect too much.",
          "The family history of Cheng Ho in Yunnan was particularly interesting. He was a Muslim whose family was defending the remnants of the Yuan dynasty before being captured by Chu De (Emperor Yongle). The 7 trips made using Melaka as a base reached Africa and the Middle East. He",
          "A huge museum with alot of artifacts and each comes with a brief explanation. For those history fans, it is definitely a go. I would have spent more than 2 hours if not for my baby girl crying for fresh air.",
          "Vert decorative. Lots of mythical figures, animals, birds and flowers. A feast for the eyes! Be aware to dress appropriately respecting temple etiquette.",
          "This is about a world known Chinese traveler Zheng he. Its quite big, and has displayed many interesting stuffs. No guided tour. Make sure to watch video about Zheng He in the museum first. Otherwise u cannot enjoy it well. Personally I felt bored after an hour",
          "Glad I went. Had to take my shoes off. I found the history interesting. I don't remember what it cost. I found the way they built buildings also interesting. With the air vents.",
          "In a small city of MANY museums - this one definitely stood out for us as the most interesting. The subject - Cheng Ho - is very interesting and the museum does a great job of re-telling the history of this great explorer. Don't miss the cinema-presentation at the start of",
          "I have read about Admiral Ho and was hoping for something more than this. The museum does have some interesting facts and models but overall it was a disappointment. The history if this Chinese admiral is so rich.",
          "Good to learn about this great Ming dynasty explorer who made a stop in Malacca. I am a bit skeptical about the authenticity of some of the Ming porcelain and pottery inside. I do not see armed guards. These are worth many many millions if real.",
          "While we didn't actually go up to the museum (which I'm sure is nice), we did visit the nyonya teahouse downstairs (using the teahouse entrance). Entering the teahouse is free of charge, and the teahouse itself is a spectacular visit as it is located in the courtyard. The auntie",
          "Well presented Museum with historical details of Cheng Ho which you may not know. Details & facts appear to be authentic with excellent artifacts displayed.",
          "Do pay for the guided ear piece as they are very clear and concised. Place is air conditioned and comfortable.Rich in history of the portugese and malacca.History buff will definately love this place",
          "Good place to learn about historical place. But it is opened at a few hours only. Also must walk a little up to the hill. Get your feet healty.",
          "Certainly worth the 10RM. A short informative video on the astounding Admiral's Armada at the start. The tour was rushed, and the guide was indifferent. The displays are a bit of a mishmash, overall a worthwhile stop. I was absolutely the only person in the place.",
          "An interesting museum if you wanna know more about the legendary Cheng Ho. There are some interesting artifacts for you to learn about his voyage. During my visit there was a guide who gave us a tour and there was even a play. A great place to be.",

          "Enlightening for the whole family, it's like visiting my old history text books and even my secondary school daughter is able to relate to the items on display. Although we went on a Saturday, it was quite empty, we have the whole museum to our family of 5 until almost the end",
          "The role of Malacca in the amazing voyages of Cheng Ho is well presented in this what seems small but is quite large private museum. The recovered briken ming pottery shards and completed pottery is incredible. The guided tour was well paced and the guide was able to answrr all",
          "I had not heard of this incredible Chinese explorer who made seven long sea journeys with a huge armada and a fleet of 28,000! His ship was five times larger than Columbus' Santa Maria. Melaka was a key port and Cheng Ho Museum dedicates itself to his memory and his history.",
          "Well, that's if you believe the featured author of 1421 (Gavin Menzies - who has his own room in this museum); China was the first country to control the world seas, started the renaissance (by influencing DaVinci and others), and perhaps even went to the US. While some of",
          "This where I enjoyed I really like it. It telling me how Chinese arrived before to Malacca and their business aiming in olden days. Dislike - no proper guide signage near road side.",
          "The video give a good introduction to the life of Cheng Ho and his seven voyages. It gives good insight into the origin of the Baba and Nyonya. The artifacts are well maintained especially the porcelain items",
          "We were pleasantly surprised that Cheng Ho Cultural Museum housed many interesting artifacts and historical items, together with very informative description including the video show at the beginning of the tour. We were equally surprised by the number of Ming Porcelain albeit",
          "You will gain valuable insights of the history of Melaka and its relation with China during ancient times dating back to centuries ago. The video show is quite impressive as it gives a brief summary of Admiral Cheng Ho exploits on its various journeys throughout Asia. One",
          "This little museum was a highlight of my Melaka trip. I've studied Zheng He's voyages before and seen exhibits about his life in other places such as Macau. I'm an admirer or what he did. Was surprised to find so many pieces of top-notch Ming porcelain. It may be one of the",
          "Visitors who are not so familiar with Cheng Ho will find this visit an eye-opening experience. It provides a clear description of Cheng Ho's contribution to SE Asia and China's trading and exploration achievements then. At least an hour should be set aside for this museum visit.",
          "Rather disorganized . On entry,it was unclear as to where one should purchase entrance tickets. I mistook it for a souvenir sales counter. The information in affiliation to the display was a \" copy and paste\" experience. The exhibits were unimaginative and obviously uncared for.",
          "We were taken here by a Malaysian friend and discovered this amazing period of Chinese history, when Admiral Cheng Ho set out from China on a series of voyages that took him around South East Asia and as far as Africa. He was head of a fleet, the size of which was not seen again",
          "This museum is one of the biggest w.r.t. illustrating Cheng Ho's 7 voyages to the South and S.W. Asia. Cheng came as an ambassador of Peace for the Ming Dynasty. I love to see the route maps, the diorama of ships (28+), the functional make up of the ships that enabled the long",
          "The museum was hidden away in a street just before Jonker street. When I first entered, the place seemed run down. However, we were led to a little video room to watch a 10 min video of history of Cheng Ho. Very detailed. The guide brought us round the museum and slowly unfolded",
          "I can only assume that previous commentators were disappointed if the museum was being renovated. We visited today, it was fully functional, did not smell of paint and we really enjoyed it. The video was interesting and we had never heard of Cheng Ho so it was completely new to",
          "I was so disappointed and let down by the Museum. There was no point visiting this place, very poorly maintained.Visit somewhere else more interesting in Malacca!",
          "The museum is very interesting and has many stories and historical records of Cheng Ho and his legendary maritime exploits around the world. It is definitely a good museum for the open-minded. They also sell some books dedicated to Cheng Ho and Chinese seafaring and maritime in",
          "We enjoyed the 5mins video presentation in English and Chinese. Very informative and educational. Exhibits are rather limited but worth the trip to know more about history.",
          "This place is not worth anybody's time or money to visit! We paid RM10 per person to enter this museum for a guided tour but we ended guiding ourselves all the way by following the painted footprints on the floor. The museum is currently undergoing renovation and it reeks of",
          "The entry fee covers a 10 minute video and a 30 minute guided tour through an historic house that is actually part of the impressive history of Chinese Muslim eunuch admiral Cheng He (AKA Zheng Ho AKA Sam Poh). It is well paced and informative.",

          "The Cheng Ho museum feels a little dated, even for a museum (!) and feels like it needs some money invested in it. It has an abundance of history to be told but has many other museums to compete with in the same area. The tour guide who took us round and spoke English was",

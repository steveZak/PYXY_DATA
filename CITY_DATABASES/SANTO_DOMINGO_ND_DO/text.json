        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports. Aeropuerto Internacional La Isabela a newly constructed airport located in the northern section of the city, within kilometres of the city center. It serves mostly domestic and charter flights. The major international airport that serves the city is Santo Domingo Las Americas, which serves North, Central and South America and also Europe.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Santo Domingo is located on the Ozama River. Its location at the center of the Caribbean is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\nThe port's renovation is part of a major redevelopment project, aimed at integrating the port area and the Zona Colonial and foster a cruise, yacht, and high-end tourism destination. Supported by legislation approved in 2005, the project, developed by the Sans Souci Group, also includes the development of a new sports marina and a 122-acre (0.49 km2) mixed-leisure real estate development adjacent to the port.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\nSanto Domingo is the terminus for four of the five national highways. The city is connected to the southwest of the country by the national highway DR-2 (Avenida George Washington and Autopista 30 de Mayo), and with the cities of the country's northwest by DR-1 (Expreso Kennedy, Corredor Duarte), which serves as a direct link to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

          "We were here on a very clear day and if you climb the tower you can get a good view of the bay and of the city. One can see that this was a good place to defend the city. The fort is a clean area but be careful walking around as you can easily stumble and get hurt....rocks and",
          "An okay option to spend an hour. Guides offer English language tours, but it is possible to see the sights without a tour guide. Admission is two dollars, guides cost more.",

          "Fort Ozama cuts an impressive silhouette along the cliff-side edge of the Colonial Zone. The outside is far more impressive than anything inside the structure. It's still worth a climb up to the top of the tower where you get some great views of the city - the colonial part at",

          "the price is perfect, the tour is not bad, the stairs are not that difficult, but the views, the pictures you can make and the entire scenery is worthy. They could exploit more the history (1940s) behind the building usage.",
          "Being here for me was really exiting after playing Assassins Creed Black Flag, you can walk into all the different areas of the fortress and see the city and river from the top. I think they should do a museum in the interior or some kind of exposition because it is completely",
          "This truly feels like a castle from old Europe with ramparts and fortifications. You can see the prison cells and access multiple buildings. Worth the small entrance fee.",
          "This was a cool place to visit. There is nothing much to see in the fort other than go to the top. It cost $70 RD per person. You can get a tour guide but I didn't get one because I had a guide book. If you get a guide, you should determine a price beforehand.",
          "It was the first military fort in america, you need to pay a little amount for entrance, but you can see it from outside and take a good pictures , its part of colonial zone tour.",

          "I cannot share the nice ratings. I visited a lot of fortresses, the last ones where in Cuba. This fortress is nothing. There is not anything to see besides empty buildings, old stones and some cannons, which arent in very impressive. Thats all. Its a waste of time and money. The",

          "The Fort is important historically but there is little signage and the site isn't particularly well cared for.",
          "This is a cool fort with great view points. The story about the structure of the fort is interesting (ask about the moat). There is a statue where the sword was stolen (only here would someone steal the sword). But the location makes for some great photos.",
          "We went there. We had to pay an entrance fee which was already used by another visitor. I guess that the staff guys at the entrance is looking for used ticket in the garbage so he can sell them again without notice of the government. The place don't worth the visit. It's dirty,",
          "It is second oldest military compaund in the new world, it is rebuild from ruins according to the Spanish maps of the time. very nice grass area around it. It has a very nice view of he Ozama River. Not much to enter, just 2 dollars entrance.",
          "This is the oldest military plaza in the Americas. Some of it has been very well maintained but I would have liked a small museum onsite to tell me more about what has happened there.",
          "Cost is $2 USD or 70 pesos per person. You can hire a guide to give you a tour but we just used the one page brochure that was free and gave ourselves a guided tour. We spent 20-30 minutes strolling around and climbing the tower to enjoy the views. I honestly thought the ruins",
          "It's nothing majestic or fantastic, but it is a very important piece of history within Santo Domingo. It doesn't even cost $2 to enter so it's cheap. You could pay a couple of extra dollars for a tour, which I would recommend. If you bring your kids, be very careful because",
          "At only a $2 entrance fee, it was well worth it. The fort is small and bare, but the top tower gives some great views and we enjoyed walking through it.",
          "This does not take much time, but it is the first fort in the new world. It was, however, never used for defense. The construction is awesome to see, considering when it was built & it was fun to just stand in the midst of antiquity",

It has one municipal district (distrito municipal), San Luis.\n\n\n== History ==\nSanto Domingo Este was created as a separate municipality in 2001 by Law 163-01, which split the Santo Domingo province from the Distrito Nacional.Santo Domingo Este is across the Ozama River which divides the east and west sections of metropolitan Santo Domingo. This eastern side is more residential and less commercially developed, but it too has experienced growth, though at a slower pace than Santo Domingo itself, with new malls and department stores.\n\n\n== Sectors ==\nWhen the city was created, these sectors were also divided:\n\n\n== History ==\nPlans for local government separate from the National District were first floated in the 1970s. Congress considered a bill in 1984 that would have created the province of Santo Domingo Oriental, which was rejected on grounds that the creation of a new province would be unconstitutional.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSanto Domingo Este has a variety of shopping centers, some of them among the largest in the country, such as Mega Centro and Coral Mall. There are also commercial districts in the Venezuela Avenue and St. Vincent de Paul areas, which feature active nightlife and restaurants.\nThe municipality also includes the Villa Panamericana, a housing complex built for the athletes of the 2003 Pan American Games.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSanto Domingo Este has three duty-free zones. Hainamosa is home to 11 businesses and 3,000 employees; San Isidro houses 26 businesses and 7,470 employees; and Los Mina has just one business and 6,000 employees. The New Isabela Industrial Park is also located in the municipality.\nCompanies with a presence in the area include Barcel\u00f3, Manufacturera Sociedad Industrial, L\u00e1cteos Dominicanos, Parmalat, Telever, Codetel, Tricom, as well as construction, energy, and agricultural businesses. One of the main activities in Santo Domingo Este is the sale of agricultural products, such as rice, beans, pigeon peas and meat.\n\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\nFaro a Col\u00f3n\nParque Mirador Este\nAcuario\nLos Tres Ojos\nHip\u00f3dromo V Centenario\nAgua Splash\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We passed by this huge building. Our tour bus stop at the front for us to see the enormity and size of this building. We did not go inside so I cant give a review of what's inside. The Pope mobile is outside of the building and donated by Pope John Paul. Would recommend to",
          "We didn't expect to visit here today so it may give us more interesting! This architecture is gigantic and beautiful. Each room is decorated with historical subjects each country donated, and of course there is Columbus's cremation. The guide in the building explained that they",
          "When there, you can see how crazy big this concrete cross-shaped structure really is. It serves as a mausoleum for Christopher Columbus' remains (allegedly) and as museum for exhibitions from all over the world. We wanted to visit it also during the night, as we saw pictures",
          "The Columbus lighthouse does not look like a traditional lighthouse. It is though a very impressive and imposing structure. We did not go in but walked around and looked at it on the outside, as well as peeked in to see where the remains of Christopher Columbus (at least",
          "I saw some poor reviews here, but I disagree. The modest entry fee was worth it just to see where (some) of Columbus\u2019 remains are interned, I found the experience extraordinary. The side exhibits from each country comprising the Americas were also interesting.",
          "Came here with few of my class mate back in 2005 and came back in October 2018.. such a great place and bring so much memories",
          "It's worth a stop to see for yourself I didn't go in (there was a charge) but you can walk around it for free.",
          "Where are the remains of Columbus - Spain or Santo Domingo? The answer, of course, is both places. Our guide told us people feared the remains would end up in enemy hands so the bones were interred in Spain and in the New World. It is said Columbus wished to be buried in the",
          "The monument is huge but it looks like the big multi-apartments building. The only thing that adds some magic is that it projects a light cross into the sky every year.",
          "We passed by this monument its a huge structure absolutely not a lighthouse. Its a monument dedicated to Christopher Columbus. Various countries donated gifts to display in the monument.",
          "They recently refurbished and cleaned this national monument. Faro Colon or Columbus Lighthouse is a must do on your bucket list.",
          "Eastern European communist brutalism, a great wedge shaped block of concrete. I don't care if it is bisected along its length and across, it looks awful. Supposedly it contains Columbus' remains which are also claimed by Seville in Spain. Unfortunately the architect was",
          "It is an ugly house but the museum has lot of history and interesting details. Christopher Columbus is resting here after removal from Catedral. Near are \"Tres Ojos\" and \"Aquaria\".",
          "This is a lighthouse of different kind since it does not look like a lighthouse at all. It looks more like grey concrete bunker or military base. Still worth a visit to the museum and Columbus mausoleum, but I wish its design were more beautiful. Check it out at night when all",
          "We walked here to see it from the outside. Impressive building. Nice to see. But would only stay max 30 minutes.",
          "I wouldn\u2019t make a special trip here especially if you are short in time. However, if you are going out to the caves then you drive right by so worth a 30 minute to 1 hour stop. It\u2019s 100 pesos for foreigners. When I went there was no power so may be worthwhile calling in advance",
          "It was a huge concrete slab. From an aerial view, one can see it's a cross--from the road you would see what would be the arms of the cross. I joked with my guide if there was a shipping mall inside. To my surprise, he said, \"That would be a huge improvement.\" There is no",
          "Everyone says its an ugly building and its is. The Dominicans might not be proud of it but it is very poorly managed. It is simply ugly and dirty around.",
          "You either like it or you don't. I didn't. Not sure why this amount of money was spent on a mausoleum for Christopher Columbus.",
          "The building has many rooms each room donated by a country. If you have seen everything in the old town, go out there but is not a must.",
          "This is an impressive momentum which I've always wanted to visit since reading about Columbus in detail at university. However the ground surrounding the site is in a poor state. Only three flags out of over 30 flag pole and feature a flag and all the street lighting around it",
          "Loved the history and architecture of the building. The most interesting of places I have visiting in the Dominican Republi.",
          "We were on a day tour of Santo Domingo and the Columbus Lighthouse was one of the stops. We did not pay the extra two dollars to go inside. We walked around outside. Saw the Pope Mobile parked outside, the vehicle the Pope rode in when he visited. Since the lighthouse sits up",
          "We stopped here as part of a day tour. We were completely surprised by what all was inside! Beside the remains of Columbus, there are small exhibits from countries all over the world. We we're escorted through the lighthouse by an English speaking guide. He gave the",
          "We enjoyed a brief guided tour in English of this interesting museum with collections from around the world. Plus Columbus' grave and ashes are here. Worth the trip.",
          "Did not tour the inside but the outside was clean but run down. Not a lot of history or information was made available to us by our guide. Good location to see the lower Santo Domingo.",
          "In 1992 we celebrate 500 hundred years of the Americas. Different Countries celebrate that moment with activities and construction of Monuments to celebrate that moment. Puerto Rico built \"La Plaza del Quinto Centenario in Old San Juan\". But in that moment, when I was a young",
          "This is a very odd building, isolated in some beautiful parkland but looking like a soviet apartment block. It claims to have the bones of Columbus, but this is much disputed. The artefacts sent from the various countries of Latin America are interesting but ironic in the",
          "very large park area. not that much to see. and not that safe to walk around. best to see by taxi. but at the same time magnificant",
          "We docked for an overnight stay in Santo Domingo during a Holiday cruise. Located on the southern coast of the country, the city is full of culture and unfortunately, poverty, thanks to the decline in the production of sugar, one of the country's main exports. We were warned",
          "I found this place fascinating. It\u2019s not a traditional lighthouse so it\u2019s rather misleading. I think I wrote another review for it under its local title of Faro O Colon. We visited it in a taxi from the 3 Eyes National Park as it\u2019s only about a 15 minute drive from there. It is",
          "Spent about 1-2hrs walking around here looking at the exhibits but really the soviet style architecture is the most interesting part! the size/scale of the building is unbelievable. The best exhibit is the anchor of the santa maria, but its sort of hidden - its at the back of",
          "Seen from far away this massive construction is another example of a white elephant. Build expressly to impress locals and foreigners (and it does) would be fantastic if maintained properly, but unfortunately it is not. The park surrounding it is also very big and holds amongst",
          "A lighthouse with no lights for its customers. How ironic! I went early to avoid the crowds and I saw the exhibits, in the dark. Plus, with security following me the whole way plus 3 of them waiting for me to get a taxi afterwards, not worth the hassle, unless you like being",
          "Was there 20 years ago when it was in its heyday... It used to light the sky with a cross, but now all that is left of it is a couple neat things inside. The place appears abandoned and that no money is put into it. It has to be rescued like the Colonial Zone is being rescued.",
          "This was a short stop on our guided tour from the cruise ship. It is huge. After explaining the site, a few people walked the distance and up the stairs for a closer look but found rooms locked that contained artifacts. It is in the style of an Aztec pyramid plus has a light on",
          "Would certainly visit this - Has a lot of history about of Chritopher Columbus founded Santo Domingo",
          "This was a massive structure on top of the hill but it was untidy and although it was to commemorate five years since columbus arrived it could have been done simpler and be more impressive. Worth a visit however.",
          "It's a huge building which contains different countries historical objects and documents... but the most interesting fact is that here Colon's remains are kept. Reccomendable.",
          "Unfortunately this site is in an incredible state of disrepair. The steps leading up to the lighthouse are broken and crumbling, many of the 70s style electronic displays are no longer functioning. The displays are small, outdated, and the building itself has poor lighting.",
          "This is a single place with all the representation of every country around the world with specimens and artifacts indicative of the rich history of each country.",
          "Upon arriving , i immediately began taking pictures, took some family photos and of course a selfie . It would have been nice if we could have seen the inside . :)",
          "...but yes, of course one has to see it when in Santo Domingo. A pity I couldn't see it lit up. This happens apparently only on the 31st of dec. every year.",
          "Would've been great to see the inside of this magnificent landmark. It was not part of our excursion. The remains of Columbus, Bart that is, are in there.",
          "At the Columbus Light House the exhibits and historical values were pretty awesome and worth seeing. They say that Christopher Columbus is laid to rest here. The museum is definitely worth the visit, as the only real problem was very few of the lights were on, very little air",
          "On our tour to Santo Domingo, we made a stop at this place. You can tell this building used to be beautiful, but is in very bad shape due to no upkeep. It used to have a lighthouse, but it is no longer working. The building needs some very serious maintenance. The inside",
          "It is a nice building with history written in the walls on the side. You can look at it from your car.",
          "The Columbus Lighthouse is well seen from Zona Colonial or Malecon (Montesinos beach). The area where it is (East Santo Domingo) doesnt look very safe, so consider visiting by walking from the center. Interesting for architecture lovers, I would say.",
          "A must see in Santo Domingo. The monument is unique and massive. We were only able to see the outside of the monument. It is claimed that Christopher Columbus' remains are inside.",
          "They have a representation of each country in America, and all Columbus expedition to America. The ashes of Columbus is in this Lighthouse.",
          "We were not super impressed with our visit to the Columbus Lighthouse, as we only got to see the outside of it. The structure of the building is not very pleasing to the eye, in my opinion. Maybe it is more interesting if you're able to go inside.",
          "Every country has artifacts here and it was a great time for me to see this wonderful attraction. They also have replica of Golden Gate Bridge nearby.",
          "We went as part of a tour and only had time to walk around the outside so were a little disappointed not to be able to go into the building (cost US$3). From the outside it is pretty impressive and the views of Santo Domingo are clear from that height. The pope-mobile was",
          "The monument is quite imposing on the outside. Did not have the time to go inside. The surrounding was unkempt and had an appearance of being neglected.",
          "Stopped here for a short photo opp as part of a tour of the town or otherwise would probably not have seen it. It's hard to describe it as it has so many characteristics. First, it is BIG. As in Aztec ruins big. It is massive and has, from the side some of the look of something",
          "Pulled over in our coach tour for photo opportunity. Not enough time to get close but doubt you would gain any more that a drive by. No idea what, if anything is inside.",
          "It is such a huge monument and it really highlights the importance of Columbus in this area. Until you walk up to the monument, you can't appreciate it's grandeur",
          "Built for the 5th Centennial anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Ameriaca's, this site is an historical landmark/lighthouse built in his honor (It's disputed whether or not his remains lay to rest here or at the Basillica in Seville, Spain). Nice stop on the way in/out of",
          "Its half an hour visit on the way to Santo Domingo, Columbus is not buried in it but would have loved too",
          "Unless you're a die hard Columbus fan this place didn't really impress me. It was well taken care of but nothing exciting in my opinion.",
          "This is a massive structure. The remains of Cristobal Colon are said to be here. It's amazing architecture and has contributions from many countries in its museum. We were able to go in on the day we went, other reviews say it was closed when they went so I would double check",
          "The history of the lighthouse was interesting. We didn't get to go inside, our tour guide only let us go to the stairs to take pictures so I am not even sure why it is on the tour!",
          "Recently viewed a documentary about this and it was worth going to view the Columbus Lighthouse in person and have a photo of the tomb that housed the remains of Columbus.",
          "If you are going to Tres Ojas then this might be worth a stop. I would not make a special trip to see this. There is sort of a museum to see, but it is boring. As many places in Santo Domingo- it is not very well taken care of.",
          "If you just want to pop in to see the building and Columbus' tomb it's okay. However there are free guided tours which I highly recommend. We had a fantastic guide who took us into the rooms with the exhibits and explained everything in detail. The lights are off because the",
          "Few of the must see places. very informative and good display of different countries history and rituals wrt LA.",
          "This is without a doubt a great monument!! the drawback is that is not in the \"city center\", is \"little out\" of the way...you need a car to get there, but you if have a car or hire a taxi, it's worth it the visit. Columbus remains are buried there (No in Seville, as the Spanish",
          "From the outside it does quite depressing. Ugly concrete block on the hill. Before the building stands Mobile Papa Saint John Paul II. In the middle of a very nice supposed tomb of Christopher Columbus. Next, there are rooms for all countries of the Americas and a room dedicated",
          "I went to visit this museum before and went back to take my 10 years old son. I love all the history behind and the architecture is amazing.",
          "Amazing experience of this light house....What an architecture... First ever light house i have seen which is cross shaped made up of reinforced concrete.",
          "Lots of exhibits from variety of countries that contributed funds to the building. Would be more interested to learn about Columbus and Dominican Republic than other countries though.",
          "This is a must see for visitors to Santo Domingo. Lots of priceless historical artifacts from several countries and of course the burial place for Columbus.",
          "We went to see this monument simply because it is a must to see, could not miss it! Although it is disputed by two countries (Seville Spain and S.Domingo Dominican Rep), which of them actually have Columbus remains, it is worth to be there anyway. Structure is gigantic! We have",
          "The monument inside has the grave of C. Columbus and pavilions of many countries around the world. The entrance is 50 RD$ that is around $1. There is not much around that area",
          "This is one of the must sees if you go there because this is where Columbus is buried and it a tribute to all the islands in the America's. I found it to be very interesting and the views of the city is amazing. You can see it from other parts of the city",
          "Interesting visit through the history of many countries around the world, I'm not sure what relevance to DR, with photos and artifacts. I did find many of the American artifacts to be representational, though not sure they were authentic. A huge structure, and I would argue its",
          "its educational and is an impresive struture and its a museum a little boring for kids and the tme in ther less than and hour",
          "This is a memorial to Christopher Columbus. At night lights are projected from the top in the form of a cross. The chapel may have the bones of Columbus but other places have similar claims.",
          "Impressive architectural building where Cristobal Colon rests in peace. A local tribute to the conquer of America including an inside museum with cultures of many countries. A must see place. Highly recommended.",
          "There's nothing there you not allowed to go inside just take a picture out side that's all so just don't waste your time...",
          "After visiting 3 eyes cenote, we stopped here. We were curious. Columbus s tomb? Who would have known. From the outside, the building is rather unflattering to itself. The interior is simply amazing. GOOD for An Afternoon venture when combined with Ole 3 eyes",
          "This structure, while worth a brief stop, perhaps, is nothing on which you'll want to invest a great deal of time. I was not able to enter the structure, and frankly, the exterior isn't much to look at. It isn't a functional lighthouse. If you want Columbus-related history,",
          "The Columbus lighthouse is beautiful and doesn't seem that big at the front but when you go around you notice how long it is and of course the Pope's car he let in the 90's years. We didn't go inside, but the view was amazing.",
          "Christopher Columbus could be buried here, and if he is, and you are in Santo Domingo, you should stop to pay your respects. This is a really fantastic structure, especially for the area, and I didn't even go inside - I felt privileged just to walk up the front steps.",
          "There's nothing there\ud83d\ude44 just the monument/light house that hasn't been on for years. If you choose you can go during the day for some nice pictures but me personally will probably keep on going to Tres Ojos Which has a much better view.",
          "What a boring place and waste of time. Not allowed inside. Not much to look at outside. Just standing outside in the heat looking at this huge building called the light house. Because it has lights on the top. No one is even sure if it is Christopher Columbus's remains",
          "From what we saw, we were really looking forward to visiting here but if you go on the Thomas Cook Santo Domingo city tour you will only see this from the road side, awful tour, do not do it.",
          "This is not a must see, but it is worth a stop if you are spending time in the capital. The \"light house\" name is misleading. This is a unique [strange] bit of immense architecture not far from the zona colonial. The museum itself is not especially well done, but this is the",
          "Like the other reviews state... this is hardly worth making a day trip. We spent less than 20 mins there. Take some fotos, decide if 100 pesos is ok to pay entry and thats it. Must have been a sight to see when they actually took car of it. Kinda like a rundown pyramid now",
          "We had a tour stop here mostly for photo-ops, but based on the description not sure I would take the time to go in and spend time there",
          "I recommend paying for the private tour, you get much more out of the visit than going at it alone....",
          "This is our first stop on the group tour. On the sides of the buildings are names of countries in continent order. Towards the right side of the building stands some old structure that played a role in history including the nation\u2019s flag and it overlooks the city. This is a huge",
          "Beautiful structure. We didn't go inside, but the view from afar was amazing. The history behind it, makes it intriguing.",
          "Our tour spent a little time describing the Columbus Lighthouse which is far too big to visit during a tour that had to include many stops. The guide described what is in it---including Columbus remains---and was not sure why it is called a Lighthouse (it is not even remotely",
          "This was one of the best attractions when completed many years ago. However, it is mostly neglected with grounds with overgrown grass and dilapidated. We arrived within 15 minutes of closing and were charged full price.",
          "We make an stop here on our way going to the beach and was fantastic, this Faro is big and very big! not many people go there and you will find it, has a lot of history too and ist a memorial monument.",
          "This is more of an Observatory place than anything else, you have a fairly good view of the surroundings of Santo Domingo. Other than that nothing else worth while. Nearby is Parque del Este with great Tennis Courts and other sports. Great for walks or jogging and safe.",
          "This building/monument stands out because of how boring and unrelated it looks to the rest of the Zona Colonial architecture which is all close by. It does not sit on the water and appears to be an apartment building from a distance rather than a lighthouse. Really? Who",
          "Airy and enjoyable tour with a very friendly, accommodating guide. Saw some original pieces from Columbus' travels including a ship anchor, and learned a lot of history! Centrally located in Santo Domingo with plenty of free parking. Small fee to enter.",
          "Unfortunately abandoned, there are many other places in Santo Domingo to visit that you better skip the Columbus Lighthouse",
          "Columbus is here in his coffin. The building is massive and a great stop on the way to the colonial zone. We had a stroll around and learned the history, purpose and lighthouse features of the building. Amazing piece of new architecture.",
          "It was amazing to be able to visit Colubus Lighthouse in Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic,,,just to think that my ancestrors became from Columbus that was something..",
          "You get to see the coffin that Christopher Columbus is layed to rest in. The museum is very humble. The resting place of Columbus is a sight to see. Tour takes about 30min.",
          "I bet Christopher Columbus would be proud of this impressive monument in his honor. Columbus' remains are also located here which is pretty awesome.",
          "We only had time for a walk around and some photos here but it is a stunning monument to the discoverer of the new world Cristopher Columbus. Thoughts about him or what he did otherwise aside this is a stunning piece of architecture.",
          "This is a large attraction but with nothing to see. You can take some pictures of the tomb through the gates but that's it. It's a huge complex and grounds yet you cannot go inside. I heard they only open it once a year on the anniversary. If anything, walking up to the top,",
          "This is a really odd structure that looks like a mixture of a grain warehouse and a military bunker. Up close, you can see that it has large indications of the countries that donated to the construction of this memorial. It hardly looks like a lighthouse and I am not even sure",
          "Not a lighthouse like you would think. It supposedly houses the remains of Christopher Columbus. Would love to have spent more time here.",
          "The building was built over two different periods by two different architects and yet it is perfect. A lot of walking but you can have a guide for free ( a tip is nice ). I would tell you more but it would ruin it. $8 cab from the cathedral.!",
          "Seriously, avoid this monstrosity like the plague. The nearby Tres Ojos is well worth a visit, but not the Columbus Lighthouse. It doesn't know whether it is an experiment in Soviet-style architecture, a monument, a museum, or a crypt. We paid the museum entry fee and were",
          "This was a fascinating monument dedicated to the 500th year celebration of Columbus' discovery of the Americas. Many countries contributed to the building of this monument and the pope visited at the time of its dedication. There are historical artifacts displayed from the",
          "100 pesos each to get in. Interesting view of the building inside. Shaped like a cross. Lots of displays from various countries as their contribution to the 500 year anniversary of Christopher Columbus discovering the Americas in 1492. Very few people visiting and only a",
          "When we went to Santo Domingo, I was unaware of the history od Christopher Columbus here. It was very interesting. They said his remains are located here. The building that houses them is not open to the public often so the tour walks around outside. The building is shaped",
          "Some call it a monstrousity, others a monument. Whichever, the Christopher Columbus Lighthouse, (Faro a Col\u00f3n) is the world's largest Christian cross -- and lighthouse -- and represents the Christianization of the Americas. Construction began in 1986 and it was completed in time",
          "The building is very big, but it seems they have not enough staff to put inside... no-one cares about the park outside.",
          "It is a giant waste of space and even its super odd and quirky aztec/soviet style architecture can't make this place worth your time. I think the dying dogs under the pope mobile out front had the right idea, it is pure misery.",
          "100 pesos (about 2$) with guided tour pretty much is already very convincing but I insist in that trip if that was not enough appeal for you. It's not only a museum, its a sanctuary of the remains of Cristovan Columbus and they have some really interesting replicas and originals",
          "I have been trying to go into the light house since I was a small child but would always arrive and it would be closed. On this last trip I google mapped it and learned the hours and was able to go in. A great place to visit if you love learning about history. Very informative",
          "It's a nice \"museum\", however, the surroundings are HORRIBLE! The streets are full of holes. We accidentally fell into one of them and guess what? we ended up with a flat tire... in fact, the tire exploded. We were stranded for 2 hours there until someone could help us. I hate",
          "A must see place in Santo Domingo. That place is great. A lot of history in that place and the people who work there are a big help and can explain everything for the lighthouse. There are artifacts from all over the world over there, Japan, Spain, USA, Canada, Ecuador, you",
          "Unfortunately our tour guide didn't value this place very much so we were only passing by shortly and stopped with the bus so we could take some pictures. From pictures and information I've I would have loved to see this spectacular place and building even if its of modern",
          "Yes, we were expecting to see what is normally referred to as a lighthouse, but this couldn't be further from one. It is called a 'lighthouse' because of all the light in and from it. It was built to remember Christopher Columbus, one of the first to visit the island, and is a",
          "Columbus Lighthouse is a must if you are visiting Santo Domingo. This is a monument built in memory of Christopher Columbus, explorer who discovered the \u201cNew World\u201d in 1492. The museum\u2019s infrastructure dates back to 1931 but it was finished in 1992, having the peculiarity to be",
          "This building is quite an oddity at first sight- I honestly first thought it was a jail when I saw it. It's a large concrete structure with no buildings... Where I come from, that's typically a jail! Not this one... this is a commemorative lighthouse and museum dedicated to the",
          "The Columbus Lighthouse is a cross-shaped monument made of reinforced concrete. We only got the chance to view the outside (with a sneak peak inside). It is quite an imposing monument but seems to lack a real purpose and needs a bit of tender loving care. Would have liked to",
          "Interesting to learn about and not alot to see although they have made a good job of the shrine. Its not a lighthouse as we understand it for the warning of ships which is why i have said this is a shrine to Christopher Columbus,s corpse. Be aware there is alot of steps to climb",
          "We went as a part of a Santo Domingo tour. There's a lot of histor here and we were told some of Chrisopher Columbus's remains were stored here. However, we weren't allowed in so we didn't know exactly what the building is for. Nicely constructed overlooking the city but we were",
          "We were very excited to visit this monument, but as soon as we got there we were pretty dissapointed. Apart from the military personnel working to \"protect\" the site, the structure is abbandoned. First of all, there is not much information about the site. We got there as soon",
          "Only saw this attraction from the street. Tour guide gave us lots of historical facts about the burial site and the lantern... I wish we would have had the opportunity to actually tour and see this landmark up close.",
          "Very interesting place but has been abandoned by authorities and has become a hangout for thieves and drugaddicts",
          "The shear beauty of this lighthouse is amazing. We did not have a guide but my BF was very knowledgable since this is in his backyard. I would recommend seeing",

          "The importance of Columbus to the Dominican people is a true treat. We pay our discovery to him but the history of his life in the Dominican is amazing, to walk through his home and see the statues was well worth the time. Take the trip to Santa Domingo its worth the wait.",
          "This design had a great look to it but the inside seems to have no thought into it when built and then someone said \"hey let's get some stuff from the other countries around us that have nothing to do with Columbus!\" The grounds have WAY to much land that is not taken care of",
          "Such a monumental place, with some of the Columbus's remains! Nicely organized exhibition of countries along the Marco Polo's routes. It's a pity this huge building is almost empty - they could have organized other exhibitions or events there. Anyway, a must!!!",

        "wiki": "The Museo de las Casas Reales (English: Museum of the Royal Houses) is one of the important cultural monuments built during the colonial era in Hispaniola, now the Dominican Republic. It is located in the Colonial district of Santo Domingo.\nIt was the Palace of the Viceroy of Santo Domingo and it is the first (oldest) headquarters of Spanish power in the New World.The building dates back to the sixteenth century, and was built to house the administrative offices of the Spanish colonies in the Americas, at the time any trespassers would be sentenced to death.  \nIt is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Colonial City of Santo Domingo.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe palace was built by orders of the Spanish Crown, represented by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, on October 5 of 1511 to house the main government offices of the colony in two interconnected buildings (hence the plural Casas Reales). In the first (South) section was the Royal Audiencia, the first court of the New World, as well as the office of the Comptroller General. The second (North) section was used by the successive Viceroys, Governors and Captains-General.\nThe original architectural structure has undergone a number of changes through the country's history. In 1807, during the period of French sovereignty over the Eastern part of Hispaniola, French general Louis Ferrand gave the facade a classical architectural style. During the last year of government of President Carlos Felipe Morales, some changes were made to use the building as the Governmental Palace. The Presidency later moved to a mansion on the site of today's Palacio Nacional. During the government of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo other modifications were made in order to house government offices.  Trujillo's office, and an extensive collection of arms and armor that he purchased, remain on display.\nThe building was later restored to its original 16th-century appearance and was established on October 18, 1973, during the administration of President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, as a museum to highlight the history, life and customs of the inhabitants of the Spanish colony. However, it was not officially opened until May 31, 1976. Attending the opening ceremony was King Juan Carlos I of Spain. A self-guided tour giving a sequential history of the island includes a portable audio speaker that is available in various languages.  It is currently one of the most visited sites in Santo Domingo.\n\n\n== Museum Rooms ==\nComptroller-General\nLegislation\nSecretaries of the Audiencia\nOffice of the Chief Judge\nWaiting Hall\nChamber of the Chief Judge\nVestibule of the Captain\nOffice of the Captain General\nFamily Life\nHistorical Ceramics\nMilitary I\nMilitary II\nGreat Hall of the Governors\n\n\n== See also ==\nCiudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)\nCaptaincy General of Santo Domingo\nRoyal Audiencia of Santo Domingo\nHistory of the Dominican Republic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMinisterio De Educaci\u00f3n\nViajar\nSanto Domingo\nHistoria Dominicana",

          "Located almost next door to the more popular Alcazar de Colen, this museum showed some of the first few hundred years of the history of the Dominican Republic - under the Spanish rule. Entry fee was just RD$100, which included a reasonably informative audio guide. The museum",

          "Took a quick tour of this house, I would advise anyone reading this review to do the same.. its a great place that has some great history locked within its walls, it even boasts one of the first Pharmacies.. that alone was spectacular to see.. well worth the tour.",
          "this was one of the best museums that explains history of a country. Be sure to get audio guide, you have to ask for it. It is included in price of museum. Part of second floor lights were out, you need to ask to have them turned on.",

          "I really enjoyed this museum. The building by itself is impressive, and it has a variety of displays and artifacts. It also had a couple different courtyards to roam around, as well as two resident peacocks. Leave yourself over an hour to completely explore and you will leave",
          "You kind have to be a history buff to enjoy the place. The museum of weapons (purchased by the dictator Trujillo at a Peace Conference) was really cool. I mean they have a sword-gun! We walked through it kinda fast. I wish I could have walked through a little slower. Unless",
          "Not sure if this is usually a free museum but it was open till very late at night on a Saturday night in December and was free when we went in! It shows all the furniture and the tools like weapons and armors used at the colonial times. They also display all the slavery of the",
          "This museum has a little bit of everything. Old and modern art representing both trained and naive artists. Some prehistory as well as history since the arrival of Europeans and the written word are represented as well. It is small enough to be covered in 1 long visit",
          "Another example of the perfection of the audio guide system the Dominicans have perfected. You can literally make your own tour of this spectacular museum. You may want to do 2 visits as there is so much to see. I loved it.",

          "Tours are self guided audio. The English was good and a lot of interesting information is provided. The numbers on the tour don't always flow sequentially and no good signs pointing you to the next location. But, it didn't matter, we ended up seeing is all. The court yards",
          "This place is beautiful. Very Louis the 16th esque. But I came to see Trujillo's office and it was not there. :-(. Still enjoyed touring the museum. Also, I read somewhere that it cost 50 pesos to get it in\u2026 WRONG. It costs 100 pesos per person.",

          "Out of the many attractions of historical significance in the \"Zona Colonial\" of Santo Domingo, this should be among the top five places to visit if you are a history enthusiast. Here you will find many places and artifacts that illustrate the very first European drives to",
          "It only costs around $2 to get in, which includes an audio, so I think it's worth a visit. There is a fairly good variety of exhibits. I particularly enjoyed the sections about the Taino people in pre-columbian times and the section about slavery. It's not a huge museum, so",
          "Now this location is pretty big so if you cant stand walking for a while this probably isn't your location. Yet, it is worth going to because it does have very unique artifacts and history. remember this is the first court house and royal audience established in the Americas. So",
          "This was the first center of government of all of the Americas, and all traffic from the new world to the old one and vice versa, had to stop here for some 25 years. Well preserved, today a museum, houses some interesting exhibits worth a 1 hr. stop.",

          "This is a well done museum about the early settlement and discovery of Hispaniola. There are models of many of the ships used in that era. There are original papers in Columbus's writing. The audio guide is well done and fast enough moving that kept even my husband a reluctant"

        "wiki": "The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, or Columbus Alcazar, located in Santo Domingo's Ciudad Colonial, Dominican Republic, and forms part of the Ciudad Colonial UNESCO's World Heritage Site.\nIt is the only known residence of a member of the Christopher Columbus's family, his first-born son Diego Columbus.\nIt was built on a plot close to the rock islet that look towards the Ozama River, granted to Diego Columbus, firstborn son of the discoverer of the Americas, Christopher Columbus, by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, to build a dwelling for him and his descendants on the island Hispaniola, to which he arrived in 1509 as governor. The building houses the Museo Alc\u00e1zar de Diego Col\u00f3n, whose collection exhibits the Caribbean's most important ensemble of European late medieval and Renaissance works of art, which were acquired in the 1950s.\nThe Tapestry collection (spanning from the 15th to 17th centuries) is particularly important and unique in the Caribbean, and includes pieces produced by the Flemish Van Den Hecke family from cartouches created by Charles Le Brun. The Alc\u00e1zar is the most visited museum in Santo Domingo.The palace is an impressive construction of coralline blocks that once housed some fifty rooms and a number of gardens and courtyards, although what remains today is about half the size it once was. It was built under Diego Col\u00f3n, the son of Christopher Columbus; when he became the 4th Governor of the Indies in 1509, he ordered the construction of a family home and governor\u2019s mansion between 1510 and 1512. The architectural style is gothic mudejar typical of the early 16th century.\nDuring the early Spanish colonial period, the mansion occupied a very important place in history. It was from here that many expeditions of conquest and exploration were planned. In 1586, the palace was sacked by Sir Francis Drake and his forces.\nAs the influence of Santo Domingo waned, the house fell into ruins, and by the mid-18th century was abandoned and in danger of rotting away. It was rescued and restored between 1955 and 1957, being transformed into a 22 rooms museum filled with period furniture, artwork, and other accessories.  A self-guided tour using a portable audio speaker that discusses each room's function is available in various languages.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCiudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n museum website",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Cathedral of Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo is dedicated to St. Mary of the Incarnation. It is the oldest cathedral in the Americas, begun in 1514 and completed in 1541. It is the Cathedral of the Archbishop of Santo Domingo who has the honorary title of Primate of the Indies because this cathedral was the first Catholic diocese and the oldest cathedral established in the New World.The Cathedral is fronted with a golden-tinted coral limestone fa\u00e7ade. The building is mainly Gothic, one of the scarce examples of real Gothic architecture outside Europe. There is also a treasury which has an excellent art collection of ancient woodcarvings, furnishings, funerary monuments, silver, and jewelry.\nIt is located between Calle Arzobispo Merino and Isabel la Cat\u00f3lica, next to Columbus Park in the city of Santo Domingo de Guzman.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cathedral was commissioned by Pope Julius II in 1504 and its construction began in 1512 under the leadership of Bishop Fray Garc\u00eda Padilla. The arrival of Bishop Alexander Geraldini in 1519 motivated the construction of a temple of greater solemnity, so it was decided to build the current church, whose foundation stone was laid in 1521. The construction was carried out by Luis Moya, according to plans designed by Alonso Rodriguez, of Seville, Spain. By 1523, the construction achieved continuous progress until its consecration in 1541. On February 12, 1546, at the request of Emperor Charles V, Pope Paul III granted the status of Metropolitan Cathedral and Primate of the Americas. Francis Drake when he captured the city in 1586, used the cathedral as his headquarters and saved it from destruction. It was also the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, which bore the aforementioned title of Primate. In 1920, Pope Benedict XV designated the Cathedral a Minor Basilica in his Inter Americae.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe first noticeable feature of the structure are the solid limestone walls and three doors, two of which are gothic and the third main door which is plateresque. There are twelve side chapels, three aisles and a nave. The roof of the nave is pitched, while the aisles have cross vaulted ceilings. The length of the basilica is 54 metres (177 ft), the width of each of the three aisles is 23 metres (75 ft), the height to the vaulted ceilings is 16 metres (52 ft) and the total area is 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft). All of the side chapels were not included in the original footprint of the building, rather they were appended with time.\nThe cathedral has a treasury containing retablos, paintings, old woodwork, furniture, sculptures and tombstones. There are pieces that were involved with the funeral proceedings of several colonial archbishops. There is a tombstone of Simon Bolivar, one of the ancestors of the Liberator Simon Bolivar. Of note, the remains of Christopher Columbus were once housed at the cathedral, before their final resting place in the Faro a Colon.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColonial City of Santo Domingo\nList of oldest buildings in the Americas\nGothic architecture#Gothic in the Colonial Americas\nHistory of the Dominican Republic\nList of basilicas in North and Central America and the Caribbean\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlores Sasso, Virginia de los \u00c1ngeles (2012), Doctoral Thesis about the construction of Santo Domingo's Cathedral (in Spanish).",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse.

          "The 3 Eyes National Park is a really nice spot to calm down a bit and enjoy the view of cristal clear water holes. Alltogether it is a pretty small park, therefor entry prices with 200 DRP are ok. The park is situated between two very busy streets, but there is almost no noise",
          "Cool place, especially if you managed to come here before or after all package tourists. Last (4th) lake is must visit. It is ,uch bigger than all the others. Also remember, that you can walk outside of caves. Doing so you can see 4th lake from the ground. Pay attention that air",
          "We arrived and were met by a guide who wanted 20 dollars to give us a tour. Reluctantly we agreed and went on a tour which turned out to be well worth the money. This is a must see. It is 3 pools that are submerged in a cave area. You can. Stick your feet in but no swimming is",

          "3 Eyes Park is a very interesting natural feature in the heart of Santo Domingo. I consider it a must see. The underground cave has stairs to take you to each lake, so it is very safe if you are careful. Our Guide was very friendly and informative. Be sure to tip your guide",

          "Give yourself the chance to get to know this place. This is a 1-2 hr hike in Santo Domingo you could easily fit into your schedule going to or coming back from the resorts in La Romana or Punta Cana. You don\u2019t need to be particularly fit and the place is fairly accessible, but",

          "The Leumi-3 Eyes Garden. A place created by an earthquake. Small lakes of different colors were created. The first - blue. The other is black (probably because of the lack of lighting, the sun's rays do not penetrate there). Third - the lake of women who used to bathe",
          "Our guide mentioned that parts of Jurassic Park were filmed here. Tranquil spot. We took a guide who filled in info as very little actual information on the place. Recommend paying the $.50 per person and taking the mini boat over one of the underground lakes to the other side.",
          "This is an amazing place. There are lots of stairs, and it's very humid, so be prepared. But what a spectacular place for a very short drive from Santo Domingo and very accessible. We walked it ourselves without a guide. Make sure to take the cave boat trip to the other side!",

          "You can go by yourself but you will not know what you are looking at. You need to hire one of the guides so that you get an explanation of how they were formed and why they are so interesting. Guides are not expensive especially if you go with your family. Uber from the JW",

          "Below the surface of Santo Domingo is another world waiting to explore. A cave system that connects three eyes, or lakes, is easily managed with stairs and hand rails. At one point the path ends and workers haul you across on a raft. Beautiful and engaging. And of course the",

          "I think Tres Ojos is like stepping down into Jurassic Park or Tarzan! You drive in off of a busy highway and climb down steps into a whole different world of beauty. There are amazing trees and vines and pools of turquoise blue water. It is so worth the 2 hours you will spend",
          "It one of the things that you can do differently in the city of Santo Domingo. It average maintained and honestly, not that special to look at or be really impressed about. It\u2019s a good thing to do if you have like one hour to kill and can\u2019t think of anything else to do.",

          "Los tres Ojos National Park is well worth the visit Take a taxi and have them wait for you and arrange a tour. 3 lakes. You actually get to cross one of them on a hand pulled ferry. There were lots of school children on the Friday we were there. We had fun trying to talk to",
          "You don't need to pay for tour. It is okay to walk the area by yourself. If you want to know more about the park a guided tour may work for you.",
          "Three Eyes is a cool park to explore the caves and cenotes that are in Santo Domingo. Getting there from the city was about 30-40 minutes from Piantini with traffic and all. It was something that's cool to check out and it doesn't take up a lot of time. If you have mobility",
          "I traveled into Santo Domingo with a group of high school students, and one of our stops was Los Tres Ojos. It was advertised as a cave exploration 'on the way back to our hotel'. I was surprised when we pulled off of a busy road into a parking lot that was still well within the",

          "When you get to Tres Ojos you won't believe what awaits below ground. It cost us 100 pesos to enter. Beautiful caves filled with the bluest waters. There is a short boat ride (pulled across by 2 men by ropes) to bring you to the final cave, take the boat over at 25 pesos",
          "Went there for about an hour in the afternoon - but could've easily spent another 2 hours. The natural formations are of incredible colors and shapes, especially the second one, which you cross aboard a little raft, manually operated by locals. If you have issues with stairs or",

          "Entrance fee is 250 pesos per person and riding a little boat which takes you to 4th lake is 25 pesos per person. When you get there local guides will follow and buy you. Don't take the deal. You can just walk and follow signs by yourself. Thankfully we didn't have a guide. It",
          "Good stop on route to Santa Domingo. Not rec. for someone who has trouble with steps (up and down). I opted to look down at the sites rather than to walk down all the steps to only have to walk back up. There were older people who just sat and waited for the tour group to",
          "This was an amazing site that goes deep down in the earth but is not at all claustrophobic-inducing. It is very open and the pools are beautiful, clear blue/green Caribbean colours. They have tried to preserve/restore some of the hieroglyphs and there are railings everywhere",
          "Well worth it and beautiful ! Just didn\u2019t like being approached more than once and being asked would we like a tour guide. We answered no , but continued to follow us and didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer. We did not use a tour guide.",
          "Beautiful under ground park (limited surface park) very much worth the short ride from colonial town. Taking the underground float was part of the experience. Downside. Police told me it was unsafe to walk anywhere outside the park grounds.",
          "The 3 Eyes NP is something that I can recommend to visit when in Santo Domingo. Special part of the experience is to take somekind of wooden pontoon boat which will take you on the other side of the lake where you can see another lake and some native carvings. Very good",
          "We ventured out on Friday with the tour guide for the colonial town however, we made him take us to the caves even though he was pressing us about time and I am glad we did because it was an amazing place. Make sure you wear sneakers. Sandals may not protect your feet because of",
          "These beautiful natural pools surrounded by stalactites, nature and in the heart of the city is worth every peso to visit.",
          "I would not have believed such a beautiful place could exist in a metropolitan area. The scenery of these three underground lakes will blow your mind. Well worth the $4 entrance fee and $.50 ferry fee to cross one of the underground lakes. Note, not suitable for people who",
          "No, you have not died and gone to Heaven. You are standing in the middle of a big Caribbean city and major tourist destination and all of it is for real. The landscapers have superbly set out a series of interconnecting stairways and paths to lead you from one vista to another.",
          "We took an Uber to visit the park and it was only one of a few attractions we were able to see in Santo Domingo due to our schedule. While at the park, we hired a guide, Esteban, for $20US for the two of us after initially decided not to. I am glad I changed my mind to get a",
          "Don\u2019t wear too many layers of clothing and wear comfortable shoes. Our guide Nicholas was very knowledgeable and patient, told us a lot of history about the four lakes and was our very own photographer. It\u2019s something to experience here in Santo Domingo",
          "Like others reviewers I skipped getting a guide - just be sure to keep 25 pesos per person for the short boat ride, it\u2019s worth it. The caves are magnificent and the entire area is very peaceful. It is easy to get to via Uber (15 minutes from the city center) and the modest",
          "One of Santo Domingo\u2019s famous destinations is the Cave of the Three Eyes (Los Tres Ojos), a limestone cave with three lakes (fresh water lagoons). To reach the lakes, you have to walk down a somewhat long, precarious stairs cut in the side of the cave. It is not for those who",
          "Only 15 minutes away from colonial zone via Uber. Entry costs 200 pesos ($4USD) at the door, and 25 pesos (50 cents USD) for the cave boat ride. Skip the \"tour guide\" offers, which were anywhere between 500-1,000 pesos per person. The sights were breathtaking, and you can see",
          "Tranquility in the midst of a bustling city, very beautiful subterranean ponds with crystal clear water, I recommend visiting this national park!",
          "the park is a bit far from old town and the price of $4 is a bit expensive. the scenary is pretty good but not outstanding. Extra money to be paid in order to visit the 4th lake",
          "This was our fav park. Its Its beautifully maintained. We had an awesome guide. They close around 4:30 pm. There are alot of stairs so be ready to climb. There are actually 4 lagoons so make sure you get to see all of them. There are two views to see them from top and also at",
          "Great place to visit on a sunny day and take a guided tour to hear the stories behind these three lakes underground. Must cross the river to see the most deep one. Need to take a small boat. Enjoy it",
          "We had a great time here, we were able to see the honey and the bee hives here as well. The water was so cold I couldn't believe it. Make sure you bring your walking shoes, alot of stairs to climb",
          "It\u2019s hard to believe this place is in the middle of such a busy city. Once you go down the stairs you\u2019re transported to a tranquil underground world. It was really beautiful. Be prepared to go up and down stairs and to sweat a lot. Even though they\u2019re caves it was quite humid",
          "Found this wonder by accident while serving in the US Army during Operation Power Pack which was a joint operation of South American and Central Americans to quell an attempted revolution in the Dominican Republic.. When I was there we had free run of this beautiful sink hole.",

          "Near Columbus Lighthouse (Faro a Col\u00f3n). It is said that three hours is minimum here. You can do it in one hour or less if you refuse the local guides attacking near the entry and refuse the boat trip (30 min). You can have this adventure by yourself. Prepare to have good boots",
          "If you have the chance to go, do it. It's somewhat otherworldly. Very soothing. Very close to the colonial zone. A 300 peso taxi ride, but you can also go there with public transportation.",
          "We were advised by a local to visit Tres Ojos National Park and we\u2019re not disappointed. If you love nature, then this should be on your list of sites to visit. The last lagoon is simply breathtaking.After a short boat ride on what the guide described as the Dominican Titantic,",
          "Nice experience. I definitely reccomend it if you're visiting santo. Very cheap 4 USD. There is a guy claiming he's a tour guida that doesn't collect salary. Dont fall for it. He is just trying to make an extra buck.",
          "A must see!!!! Words cannot do this park justice. Go in the morning time if you can because that is when the sunlight comes into the caves the most. When the sun hits the lakes, they look like they are glowing!",
          "There is some beautiful scenery especially when you get on the boat that takes you a.l private spot. Short tour so if you\u2019re looking to really explore or go hiking this is not the spot. If you want to take some great photos and videos that would be during the boat ride part.",
          "This place is great to visit if you have 2 hours free, it\u2019s cheap $ 4 USD per person if you aren\u2019t dominican, parking is available at no extra cost ( even though people might come up to you and ask for a donation for watching over your car) you can either go in and explore on",

          "It was an easy drive from the hotel we stayed at ,the Sheraton, with only a 20 minute drive. Free parking and plenty of parking spots. A little hard to find and in the middle of a city neighborhood. After you enter through the main gate, just take steps down to this natural",
          "This park is very close to the Colonial Zone where we stayed. It's right in the middle of everything so it seems impossible that this lovely gem could be hidden where it is. The third pool of Tres Ojos closes about an hour before the park closes, so make sure to get there",
          "It was amazing what we could see with our eyes that day, something fantastic, we were speechless!! The 3 Eyes National Park is the best! you can't not go there....",
          "It's 200 peso each to enter. We got a tour guide for 1000 peso between two people. He was very nice and took lots of photos but really he isn't needed. Don't attempt to walk home or the cestur will follow you as they think you're crazy for even attempting this.",
          "It is a beautiful place to visit. The staff was a little pushy about tips, though. Overall, I was glad I got to see it.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit to Three Eyes National Park. There are a lot of vendors/taxi drivers waiting outside the entrance, and a number of guides that will try to push their services on you. Say no to all of that and go explore the park for yourself. If you take the time to",
          "It is a perfect place to be relaxed. Nice enviroment and good to stay with the family. We enyojed our visit.",
          "Very nice park in Santo Domingo. I would never have realized it existed until I entered the gates. Clean, Professionally run park with underground lakes, caves and beautiful walking trail. Food is available.",
          "My dad and brother were visiting and, unfortunately, it was raining for an entire day of their trip. It can be difficult to find places to go or things to do in the DR when it's raining, but this is a good outdoor activity even when water is falling from the sky. Most of it is",
          "Beautiful place to visit if you love nature and caves. Bring some bred to feed fish, turtles and ducks.",

          "When I saw this on Trip Advisor I knew it had to be on my Santo Domingo Bucket List. I was not disappointed at all. Our guide was fantastico and very informative. He also gave us the choice of Spanish or English. It\u2019s not handicapped friendly, but if you\u2019re ok with staying up",
          "I loved going to Tres Ojos, it was beautiful to see the caves and it was not crowded at all, maybe because it was Sunday. I really recommend this activity!",
          "Nice water, feels very fresh and beautiful colors It's nice to visit, takes about 1h to see all. Almost in the middle of the city",
          "I made that reference when we crossed one of the pools. No one got it. My young guide (luxury--I was the only one who signed up for the tour) did. He was very bright, well educated, and mature for a 20 year old. The site was part of a city tour, and by the time we arrived I",
          "Highly recommended to visit this attraction. It is very interesting to see 3 lakes inside the cave. You would want a guide to explain to you the origin of the lakes.",
          "It was a great change of ambiance for people that already live in the city, alot of walking, it looks amazing, You have to pay Extra to see the best view",
          "If you visit DR, Los Tres Ojos is a must! It looks so out of place finding this Natural Wonder within Santo Domingo city limits...but it looked good. Just beware about vendors and \"tour guides\", way overpriced. Still cool place to visit...enjoy!",
          "Great geological formations and wildlife. Be prepared for some stairs and skip the tourist trap vendors on the way out!",
          "I was amazed by this place and I decided to have my wedding photos taKen there. The entrance is 100 pesos, so it's kind of cheap. And you feel you're in a fairy place.",

          "Whilst you won\u2019t spend lots of time there - roughly an hour - it\u2019s worth a look and definitely pay the 25DOP to take the boat across to the other lake - it\u2019s the most spectacular. We took an Uber - 140 on the way there and 210 on the way back due to traffic from the colonial",
          "Los 3 Ojos (the 3 eyes) are 3 open air underground caves with lakes. It's open to the public from 9 to 5. It's an interesting adventure and you can take great pictures in there. By the way, there are many stairs and it's not accessible for people on wheelchair and not",
          "The site is another must see during your visit to Santo Domingo. Just seeing the beauty of these under ground caves and lakes were breathtaking. I enjoyed every minute of this tour. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and it was interested to get to know more about these",
          "We popped in to visit this place on our way to Boca Chica. It\u2019s well worth a visit the caves are very impressive and there is lots of security so you will feel safe parking.",
          "it has very nice small lakes. Very small territory, no guide needed (and still nothing spacial to tell about). I think the best I have seen in SD. Be carefful in the local cafeteria, the worker gives wrong change and the prices 4 times higher than in supermarket, so better to",
          "very nice, can get some beautiful photos here. lots of stairs!!!!!!! you should wear sneakers to do this.",
          "Seriously, I have seen a lot of caves around the world, but this place is gorgeous and mysterious and so worth it - and so close to the center of Santo Domingo! Try to get there early on the weekend, to have the place to yourself, and don't forget to walk around the park area",
          "It is a real miracle how the nature created this. Four hidden underground lakes with unique subculture. Must visit this place",
          "I went with my parents for a day out. We really enjoyed it. The best thing about it for me, it took me totally by surprise. I drove past this place so many times, but never cared to check it out. Really good experience, I definitely recommend it!",
          "Really worth a visit! You don't need a guide. But take the small boat to the last lake. It's amazing!",
          "Don't miss this marvel of nature in the city. The first three caves were wonderful but the fourth was the best for me! Take the short boat ride to see it. At 25 cents, it's a bargain and you will not be disappointed!",
          "Tres Ojos is just 10 minutes by taxi from the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo. Uber would have been cheaper, but we took a taxi from the Colonial Zone and had the driver wait for us while we toured the caves - $25 for taxi ride. It was 200 pesos per person for admission. It",
          "This was breathtakingly beautiful and our guide was funny and knowledgeable!! You can take a boat ride across the water for an extra cost. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and clothing, it can be quite humid inside the cave.",
          "The park is known as Tres Ojos (Spanish for 3 eyes). It is a beautiful place to visit and a little boat/ cart takes you from the one eye to the other. I personally don't think it is necessary to use the tour operators available there because they just talk non-stop and you",
          "Definitely worth to see. Especially if you love beautiful nature spots. Hidden underground oasis in the middle of a big city, with lakes, caves and some flora surrounding the last lake. For me it was the nicest place I have visited in Santo Domingo. Some practical information:",
          "If your looking for something to do while in the city, you have to visit this park. The caves and under ground lakes show you how amazing nature is. Didn't require a tourist guide since I had a local friend. But a tour guide is recommended if your not from the country.",
          "I've been to many caves in the US, but these are still worth seeing. The caves themselves are not unique, but the deep blue water and tropical landscape make them very different. The short boat trip across the lake is worth the minimal time and cost - don't let your tour",
          "Looking down from the top it is hard to see why the big deal but go down there when the sun is out and it is stunning as the sun lights up the pools. You need to be reasonably nimble as you are going up and down unpaved paths all the time.Best bit? The raft!",
          "This is a nice place to visit. The guides are knowledgeable and tell the whole story as to how this cave was discovered.",
          "A jewel of nature in the city! Really beautiful place with grottos and lagoons. Lots of stairs that can be slippery when it's raining. Beautiful scenery. Enjoyable for nature lovers.",
          "Nice little day out with something different to do The caves were lovely and great for Pictures - however they really do haggle you for more money for tours etc when you can really walk it all yourself Can get quite exhausting walking around in the heat so grab some water!",
          "Very beautiful nice caves. It worth going. Just be aware when you leave the place. The venders can be very pushy. The get mad if you don\u2019t buy anything. They even calculate the prices for you in US dollars and euros. And the will push you to buy stuff and take you to a atm",
          "I have been to many caves in many places but the 3 Eyes is especially noteworthy. It is a very peaceful place with knowledgeable guides (we had Domingo). The integration of the walkways and steps using the indigenous materials was done very well and makes the experience",
          "We visited in July 2017 and stopped here on our way up to our vacation rental in Saman\u00e1 province on the opposite (North) side of the country. It was probably my fourth time visiting this place, but it opened up a lot (due to earthquakes) from when I went as a child, so things",
          "This park is beautiful. We spent a couple hours there. We didn\u2019t get a tour, but I don\u2019t regret just exploring on our own and doing our own research.",
          "Breathtaking caves. The short \"boat\" trip inside one of the caves and the scenery after that are a must. Foreign tourist pay double price and this is not stated on the cash desk. However, you receive a bracelet stating that you are a foreigner and the price (200 pesos).",
          "They have guided tours very affordable , they know their history for the caverns. Water is so clear . A must see place in santo domingo. Family friendly and a nice place to relax and enjoy nature.",
          "3 Eyes National Park was truly amazing! Well worth it to stop by and see! If you want a tour, guides are available. We did not use one and still found the experience truly special. We paid for the raft boat, which was well worth it!",
          "what a place, go there early in the morning, it is cooler, and there are less visitors. It is a lot of walking around, bring your tennis shoes.",
          "Wonderful tour! There is a snack bar and restrooms at the beginning of the tour. There is a large parking lot. To get down into the cave there are several steep stairs. Comfy shoes are a must! The guide explains many interesting facts about the cave, including that it was",
          "Very worth the stop and price of admission! Also clean and well kept, a nice contrast to the surrounding area. Follow others advice and skip the tour guide.",
          "It will take a couple of hours but walking in the caves was suggestive, the water is crystal clear and blue and you can watch it for hours. If you take bread with you you can feed the fish in the last lake!!!",
          "Great stop on the way to Santa Domingo. We taxied from Punta Cana. Caves are very cool. Avoid the guides you don't need them. They wanted $30US to walk with you through the park. Wear good walking shoes as it's a hike around the park and down the numerous stairs into the caves.",
          "We really enjoyed Domingo, our tour guide and seeing \"Tarzan\" the cliff climber and diver. Not sure I enjoyed getting bombarded by salesmen at the end in the gift shop.",
          "Skip the guide, enjoy the natural beauty. You can get here with Uber and pay the RD$200 entrance fee. The boat ride once you are in the park is only RD$25",
          "We visited Los Tres Ojos as part of an organized city tour. It was well worth the stop! We changed our plans to take the city tour in the morning rather than the afternoon. We we're glad we did as it was already a bit muggy. Keep in mind that there are a large number of",
          "It's the best in Santo Domingo. 3 beautiful in cave lakes. A bit of hard walk, stairs, but once on each site, you forget all the trouble to reach them. Very, very beautiful. As usual, they are going to offer you a tour guide at the entrance for 1,000.00 pesos (20.00 bucks). Not",
          "A nice place to visit! Have been here several times and it never gets old how awed I am with this piece of heaven,",
          "This a place to go when you want to wander around the city, but you want to do it in the most relaxing way. Beautiful caves with secret lakes, this is an amazing display of beauty from nature in the city.",
          "I really liked this park, although it is not a place to swim, water and caves are fantastically relaxing to spend a couple of hours. You're gonna love it!",
          "We like it nice cave. Don\u2019t think twice get a guide there is a fee but it will be fun. And they will tell you every thing you want to know regarding the cave. Don\u2019t remeber the name of our tour guide but he was awesome. He is on the picture.",
          "We took an Uber out here at about 9am. We were glad we went early as we had the place to ourselves until just before we left. Entry is 200 pesos, you definitely don\u2019t need a guide. The steps down are easy to navigate and the sink holes are beautiful, the light just shining",
          "If looking for something to do in the city, this place is highly recommended. A series of caves and groundwater. Nice escape to feel the Nature being in the city.",
          "We went to the 3 Eyes National Park and were surprised to see so few tourists there. The caves are beautiful and the entrance is reasonable (200 pesos/person). You can take a little pull-boat across to another cave for a small fee. Highly recommend!",
          "Beautiful location. Must see for your trip to Santo Domingo. Once you pay there will be local guides that will charge about $20 USD for a tour of the park. Good to do if you are interested in the history. Must take the mini boat for the 4th \"eye\". It is a beautiful location",

          "This was a great stop on our day trip from Punta Cana. Our tour did Not have it on the agenda, but I asked for it and we did it after seeing the city. Cost is $5 or 200 pesos (which is less than $5 if you have pesos). The stairs are a bit steep, but there is a railing so anyone",
          "We enjoyed our experience exploring the underground caves & lakes. Lots of steps to get there and back up but it was worth it!",
          "The weather is great in Jan. This is a must see place if you are in Santo Domingo. We took Uber Fri colonial area to 3 eyes for 200 pesos. I particularly liked the first lake. The combination of trees, water colour and rock formation is picture perfect. The cafe is very basic.",
          "A great place to visit in the city. Not to be missed if visiting Santo Domingo. The restaurant could have been more updated as the things sold was very limited.",

          "This is not for small children or the elderly. Lots of stairs to get down there, but once you do it's like nothing you have ever saw. Take the raft ride through the cave to the last hidden pool. Tip the gentleman for crackers to feed the fish. Souvenirs outside are beautiful but",
          "awesome underground lakes and caves. make sure to take the underground boat trip to the 4th lake. most beautiful place in the world.",
          "This is a set of 4 small natural water holes with the most clean/clear water. Entrance fee is only 100 pesos each, and there is a snack bar and restrooms at the top. You then descend down some stairs to underground caverns which are actually open to the sky. The pools are of",
          "Great, unexpected trip to 3 Eyes, thanks to Greyline Tours. Thanks to our Tour Guide and Driver for a fun trip!",
          "First, I don't even like caves. It was a very nice place to visit. The day we were there they were getting ready to film a documentary. Watching them get a canoe down to the lake was worth the trip.",
          "Beautiful attraction just outside the city. We spent 2-3 hours walking around looks at all the pool and it was really quiet, so we saw quite a few birds and small animals running around. We didn't get a tour guide and it was no issue - used uber to get there and found a taxi",
          "We went to the park without tour guide. The ticket are cheap. They eyes water are astonishing and marvelous. They are a jewelry in the city of Santo Domingo. You have to take the boat ride, is cheap too and you can take the most beautiful pictures. Be prepare to walk and use a",
          "A hidden treasure not far from the city centre! An escape from the heat and I think used in Jurassic park films, a smashing little place of stalactites and stalagmites that look beautiful! Taking thousands of years to form contemplating the formation is mind boggling! Well",
          "Visited this park back in 10/17. The weather that day was in the mid 80's and very humid. Decided to go because the pictures we saw online were beautiful. We ubered to the park from our hotel and it was pretty cheap. Around $4 US. There were multiple people in thr front selling",
          "This is a great half-day trip from Santo Domingo. Our Uber driver had a very hard time finding it but we got there eventually and it was lovely. Be prepared to go up and down many staircases to see the gorgeous colors of the 4 pools. You can also take a short boat ride, it's fun",
          "This is a beautiful park with incredible grounds and sparkling clear blue natural waters. The caves are fantastic, the water tranquil, and the trees strong and lush. This is a must place to visit!",
          "Hidden in the city and worth the trip. We spent ~ 2 hours exploring with our kids ranging from teens to 6 years old. The pictures are fantastic but you must experience this to truly appreciate. The cost is incredibly cheap. We went without a guide and enjoyed but can see the",

          "Driving in Santo Domingo is a nightmare, but this is a short Uber ride across the river. It's a pretty basic park at first look, but then you go down a spiral staircase and get a WOW factor. We only spent about an 45-60 minutes there, so it's not a big deal to make a whole day",
          "Beautiful place. There is four lakes but we only got to see 3. We were able to take a guided tour in about 1 hour. Only complaint is that the bathrooms were dirty and the people trying to sell you crafts on the way out that get pretty annoying. They had nice stuff but just",
          "It only took us 1 hour to see almost everything and have tons of photography of the caves and lakes. So, tourists can squeeze it right in the middle of their daily plans. It is indeed beautiful tho.",

          "Los tres ojos is the perfect place to fill one's lungs with fresh air while exploring Santo Domingo. If you're tired of walking around the zona colonial or the city in general, grab a taxi and spend half a day there. My favorite lagoon is the one that can only be accessed by",
          "It was really nice place, beautiful park all around but inside the cave it was out of this world. it felt funny at first going down inside not knowing what you were going to see. For anyone who like nature at its best well worth it.",

          "Really cool caves, amazing water and limestone. So cheap! 200pesos for 2 of us. That's like 2 dollars each. We were there for around an hour and took the little boat (floating platform pulled along by a rope)to the 4th lagoon- without doubt the best cave. Only 25 pesos extra",
          "This is a nice park to visit with family or on a date. Please beware that the stairs leading down to the cave are a bit dangerous so make sure you were the appropriate attire for this park. Great experience",
          "This place is amazing for the family. It is an unforgettable sight of different underground lakes. This place is well known to the local tourist and there are many local arts and craft to purchase on the way out. The price is not bad at all.",

          "This was an interest series of four caves and pools that are worth a visit. The place is reasonably well developed although the steps down are not that good but OK..",
          "The caves are nice to visit - though the humidity is oppressive. The steps leading to the caves and their lakes are slippery when wet. With the humidity they may always be wet. If you are careful, it is worth the trip down.",
          "The park is amazing! Exuberant nature, wonderful blue pools of water, a cave and a trail to walk around and contemplate this marvel. The visit won't take too long but it is totally worth it. It is located in the capital, it has good access and the entrance fee is not high.",
          "The entrance fee is incredibly cheap and you can spend an hour here no problem. There's no need to get a guide, unless you want one, as there is no way that you could get lost.",
          "Definitely a must see if you are new to Santo Domingo. The environment is breath taking and lakes are amazing.",
          "We did not expect such a place to exist so close to Santo Domingo. It is very well preserved/taken care of. There are 4 \"ojos\" (lagoons)- the third and biggest one allows you to cross to the other side where the outdoor lagoon is for a 25 peso fee per person (worth it). What",
          "It's a fantastic place for taking photos beside water. Sun rays make water shine with a very nice turquoise color. It's a nice trip with kids, that includes a little \"sailing\" in a raft :)",
          "A natural beauty spot of Santo Domingo. It was 100 pesos to get in. It was 25 pesos to take the ferry through one cave to the fourth cenote. Definitely worth it. It's humid so be prepared to sweat.",
          "If you visit the city of Santo Domingo and love nature, a place that can\u2019t miss in your itinerary is the Three Eyes National Park, a cave with three lakes of fresh and crystalline water, and a fourth lake that is outdoors and can be seen from a viewpoint . It has a mysterious",

          "In my opinion, this is a must visit location. It is a well maintained and incredibly beautiful natural cave with lakes. The paths are well groomed and fairly easy to negotiate. Note that this is not handicap friendly. There are many stairs and pathways. In one location there is",

          "You would of thought that it would be cool in the cave but it was HOT and HUMID! A beautiful experience nonetheless. Would have loved to cross the water with the boat but it wasn't part of our excursion.",
          "We visited the morning we were scheduled to leave the D.R. We stayed two hours and was able to see all of it except the subterranean boat ride. The walkways have railings and steps making it moderately easy to to climb in and out of the caverns. It was incredibly hot and",

          "It seems, name \"3 eyes\" derived from 3 underground pools. One should visit in day time. This place is within city limits and can be reached by local taxi or Uber. Time to spend there is 2-3 hrs maximum. This is entry fee of around 100 to 200 Dominican Pesos",
          "I visit this place with my daughters and we were astonished. It was terribly hot and the humidity was almost unbearable, but it was worth it. To go down there is a staircase with many steps. It is not necessary to pay for a guide.",

          "We visited here with our 3 kids (ages 14, 16, and 20) and they all enjoyed the visit. We didn't use a tour, simply drove in from our hotel in Punta Cana and paid at the ticket area. We took the small boat over to the other area (literally a 2 minute ride!) and paid a minimal",
          "The tour isn't very long but Tres Ojos is worth a visit. The lakes and caves were beautiful. Entry is 100 pesos but beware of the tour guides. I was approached by one guide who said the fee is $35 for a guided tour with explanation and the boat to go across to one of the lakes.",
          "I can strongly recommend this park! It's perfect either for adults or for children! It's practically very near to city center (Uber costs 140 RDS). Worth to see!",

          "I would say this is a can't miss spot in Santo Domingo, a hidden gem right on the outskirts of the city. Beautiful lagoons inside of caves! There's a 100 peso entrance fee and a 20 or 25 peso boat ride (do the boat ride, it's worth it). A lot of people will try to sell you on",
          "Located just outside Santo Domingo, this small natural park has an open cave with 3 small but beautiful lakes, it takes 30 min to explore, nice rock formations and the lakes have unusual colors",

          "I went to the National park with couple of fellow hostel dwellers and it was worth it. The enterance is around 100DOP (2\u20ac). The area is pretty small, that makes it wonderful place to go and have an easy 1,5h trip. Caves were cool, quite big with super clear water. I'd",

          "This outing is very near Santo Domingo, 30 minutes taxi drive. In an hour you could see the whole area. Worthwhile to go. There is one of the caves that you cross with a boat pulled by ropes, at the other end you can enjoy a fabulous cenote. Beautiful place to visit!!",

          "It was not what I expected. The lakes in the caves are beautiful. When we went there was hardly anyone else here and it was so peaceful I could stay there all day. There are a lot of stairs, so be careful. There is also a small raft ride (25 Dominican Pesos) to another lake",
          "If you are in Santo Domingo this park is a MUST SEE! Well worth your time and the 100 pesos per person. There is a boat on one of the underground lakes that will take you to a beautiful cave on side of the main lagoon for 50 pesos more.",
          "The caves and water are beautiful! This is a once in a lifetime experience. The guides are also very knowledgeable, too. The only downside is after the tour there are local vendors who very aggressively try to sell you things. The experience is totally worth it, though!",

          "interesting place, close to the city. Apart from having to walk stairs, very accesible. The water is amazing, it is kept very clean and not expensive. Do not miss the last \"eye\" you have to take a small boat to get there.",
          "The park seems small from the trails up top - all of which are also gorgeous and allow you to sit and look out over the sunken lakes - but once you descend the stairs into the caverns below, you realize how massive and how breathtaking this place is. My friend and I scampered up",
          "high recommended. really wonderful place and we had a very nice time. have a look also to the 4th eye :)",

          "We only had about an hour and was unsure about visiting here but we are so glad that we did! It was beautiful and we could have stayed loads longer. It's worth going on the little boat to the last lake. I wasn't quite sure what to expect beforehand but I wasn't disappointed and",
          "This park is fascinating. It is literally a hole carved out in the ground with four beautiful lakes and a series of caves. I found the tour guide to be quite accomodating and informative. The reception area appears a bit lax. Too many people milling about.",

          "Surrounded by a beautiful park these lakes are belong ground in semi open caves, a good number of steps but worth the trip down to see the rock worn away by the ocean. Worth spending a little bit more to go on the raft to see the final lake. Make sure you barter!",
          "Surrounded by a great park, Los Tres Ojos was quite the sight. A lot of stairs but worth the walk down to see the lakes created by the ocean washing away rock and forming these picturesque sights! Very low cost to look and to receive a guide. It was worth the extra bit of money",
          "So picture going down many steps into a cave, but the top of the cave caved in many years ago, so instead of a murky dark cave, you walk into a beautiful tropical stone garden. As you explore the cave you discover thee eyes of water (lakes), crystal clear turquoise water with",

          "We enjoyed visiting this park on our tour of Santo Domingo. It was beautiful and unique. I recommend using one of the local guides to give you a tour of this park",
          "The waters of the three pools have a beautiful color to them. The cave formations are interesting as well. It was very busy the day we went and we visited very quickly as part of an one day Santo Domingo tour. Would have been interesting to ride the boat.",
          "We were a group of six, two of which had poor mobility. We were in no rush and the guide allowed us to go as slow as we needed to accommodate mobility issues. It is a long way down to see the fourth lake, which is spectacular. It is also a very long way back up so plan",
          "Well worth the descent and even more aruoius ascent of the cave pools. Guides were knowledgable and good english. Convenient refreshment bar and toilets on exit.",
          "Go early to avoid crowds and lines at the \"boat\". The fourth lake (via the boat) is the most spectacular. If it's not crowded you will be in and out in about 40 minutes. When you come back out of the ground, you can follow a trail to see the 4th lake from above.",
          "Me and my boyfriend went to Los tres ojos on a monday morning, I recommend going early in the day, we had the hole place almost for ourselves! Its REALLY beautiful, and its best going on a sunny day (I guess the water is most blue then) the water is SO cristal clear and blue! It",
          "We had an awesome time in the park. We just paid 2$ and 25 cents for the \"boat\" to get to the other side. Even the bus ride from Santo Domingo was so much fun! I mean you have to wait till the bus is full and you never know where the bus is going to stop and how long it takes",

          "As above an interesting tourist trap, you can only walk by the cenotes, no swimming. Tons of people around trying to make money, e.g. A guide offering his guiding for 25 min visit and charging 30$. Not worth paying that. Taxi drivers are offering a tour from the colonial zone -",

          "This was undoubtedly the most surprising part of our day-long tour to Santo Domingo. When our bus pulled off the highway and circled through a tired, rough looking neighbourhood into a tiny parking lot, I wondered where the heck we were stopping. Even when you get off the bus",
          "I am glad that we saw this but it wasn't a must-see for our family. It may have just been that we were tired when we went.",

          "This is a national park with 3 caves and a lagoon. It costs $100rd to get in, but I heard that next month it'll be something like $200rd for locals and $300rd for tourists. Many years ago (70s I think) it was just a swimming hole, but the gov took it and stopped people from",
          "This was an amazing trip, short and very close to the city, is very convenient, Don't walk here as I heard that neighborhood around it is not friendly!",
          "This place is worth checking out, especially since it is so cheap. You can take an Uber there from zona colonial (about 10 minutes). There were no crowds when we were there. The little boat/ferry ride inside the cave is fun. it was rainy when we were there, but still nice.",

          "We had a guided tour to Santo Domingo and this small, but interesting national park was our first stop. And it was definitely worth visiting! There are there of these eyes or caves accessible by foot, and the fourth one by a small boat. We didn't do the fourth one, but saw the",

          "This is a beautiful place to visit. There are steep stairs down descending into the cenote. You walk up and down paths to view the bottom. There are railings to help.The trees and plants growing inside are really cool. It is a short distance from the colonial zone. It might be",

          "Very interesting to see even if on your own. We took a tour guide with us from the Zona Colonial and he explained in detail the history of the area and what makes it special. You can cross through the water on a small transport raft to another more isolated lake for 50 pesos.",
          "Must see while in Santo Domingo, the tour guide was fun and professional, told us interesting facts about the cave",
          "This is a must see. Number one tip: skip the \"tour guide\" and go it alone. Bring water and be prepared to sweat down in the cave. Don't forget to walk top side as well. Beautiful.",
          "If you are in SD you must go! So close and only takes about 1-2 hours in total. Use a guild. so much more useful.",
          "Popped here for a short trip whilst on cruse. I wish I had gone earlier and made the most of this place. Watch out for guides who jump on you after entrance they will charge and you only need them if you want a fact tour. An odd place for this to be so best get a taxi and",
          "Right in the city, without having to travel far just 15 to 20 minutes there exists this much beauty, three natural pools in cave like environment that will definitely make an impression. Santo Domingo has so much to offer In tourists attractions.",

          "Is not far away from the city you can stop by on your way to the city or when going back to airport!! Is really cheap to entry... You go all the way under the ground, a lot humidity but what your eye will see is Worth it!!! 3 Crystal Waters eye holes amaizing!! Dont forget to",

          "A surprising and beautiful places that includes a \"cenote\" with 3 small lakes with wonderful coloured waters and a fourth nearby. The visit should be done in the morning when the light of the sun reach the bottom of the big hole.",
          "This is a breathtaking natural wonder! These caves are something else! I really really loved this awesome park!!!",
          "This is an REALLY Beautiful Natural Park. The drawback is that \"out\" of the city, and in order to go there you need to go by car, but if you have the opportunity to visit, you will not regret it. Stoning !! There is an entrance fee per person. Make sure you bring Local",
          "So for about 30$ you get a guided tour and its worth it. The views are amazing and the rivers are beautiful. Our tour guide Victor was amazing and funny! You are not allowed to get in the water but you can touch it. There is a little boat that takes you from the third lake to",

          "Great place to visit. The pools are amazing (if only you could swim in them!). He greenery is amazing. Just a good beautiful thing to check out. Only word of warning is about taxis: taxis are very cheap as long as you agree in advance on the price. We thought we had, but when",
          "There are three lakes at this park. Although the park is not big but to access to the lake you will need to climb up and down many steep narrow stairs. This area swimming is not allowed. The underground water is so... clear and the rock formation is amazing. All lakes are at",
          "After reading the reviews we decided to visit. We opted for a guide, which included the fare for the boat ride to the lake.. well worth the visit and the guided tour.. an unassuming park, but delightful to visit.",
          "How can it be so humid in a cool cave so far underground? The first cave had a turtle swimming in it. The best cave was the one you had to get the raft to (25 pesos return). Great geology - limestone, stalagmites, stalactites with bats and then the most awesome vista as you",
          "A must visit when in Dominican Republic. Stunning views of caves , a hidden gem in the city of Santo Domingo. Easy to get around and inexpensive!",
          "When the tourist guide told us he is going to take us to 3 eye national park the first thing came to my mind was another park with trees and grass and some historic moment to it. But when we entered the park and we were told to step down and explore the place for our self and",
          "Worth the trip; wasn't really sure what to expect. Don't need a lot of time, but plan 30 to 45 minutes. Humid and lots of stairs if physical limitations. May feel a bit claustrophobic at times - easy to avoid",
          "We went on our own and didn't have a tour guide but really didn't need one. The walk was good exercise but make sure you wear shoes with non slip soles as the steps are very slippery in places. It cost us 100.00 DR pesos (less than $2.00) to go in.",
          "Definitely worth the short drive from the city to see. There are 4 bodies of water, although one is quite small. We took the little boat ride to the 4th, and it was the most beautiful in my opinion. We had lucky timing and pretty much at the place to ourselves which made the",
          "This is a lovely park with some nice paths for walking. Getting to the cenotes means a lot of steps up and down, many of which are quite steep, so I didn't attempt them. You can view the cenotes from above. There are somewhat primitive washrooms and a cantina on site as well as",
          "A pretty cheap activity that last about a hour or so. There are about 60 steep steps leading Down into the cave system. Which is the only access so if you have mobility issues I would advise against visiting. Once you've completed the steps down and peer around it's like your",
          "Nice, easy walk. Biggest cenotes I've seen. You can get down to the water pretty easily. Went with a tour group. Recommended. However, the merchants in the \"exiting area\" were tough to get through.",
          "Very special and beautiful place. Cheap entrance fee but don't take the guided tour that is offered to you when entering the park. It's a total rip off! 30 dollars for no valuable information what so ever. Better and more fun to look around on your own",
          "Small admission charge allows you to see one of natures most beautiful and interesting underwater cave system. Multiple scenes from Jurrasic Park were reportedly shot here.",
          "Its amazing to see what the earth can create. I heard of this place since I was little and visited when I was little but i didn't remember it. When i went now i saw how amazing it is. The rocks, water, how its formed. Its just beautiful.",
          "The park, which is very convenient on a trip to the Faro de Colon, is composed of four small lakes within a series of caves. The trip from the center city is about half an hour, but can be combine with the trip to El Faro and the colonial zone. It is \"nice\", but not worth a",
          "We went here just to checkout if it's interesting and it turned out to be much better than we expected! Beautiful underground lakes and we even met two turtles there. Pure water and nice place for some relax.",

          "We arrived a few minutes after it opened which gave us good light and colours. I was amazed that it was in the middle of the city, and was still very nice. Didn't take very long to see it and we were hot by the end.",
          "As a student of geology and scuba diver of blue holes, was fascinated to explore this uplifted ancient reef. It is 230-some steps down and then a return back up, but at 75 years old, the trek was not an issue for me.",
          "We got an amazing TAXI driver (use What's App in DR to connect with locals 849-220-5673) who took us around town and also to see these amazing cave lakes. Pay the $20 USD for the local tour guide who brings the place alive with their stories. This is great for your travelers",
          "My husband, niece and I visited this attraction as part of a day trip tour from Punta Canta to Santo Domingo. The guide took us to the tres ojos but we did not see the entire park. Had this been an unlimited time tour on our own, we would have seen as much as possible. I love",
          "WE get there with not too much expectation but it is a really mind blowing place in Santo Domingo. If you like nature this is a must to do. Reminde that you will walk trough caves and humidity is quiete high. It is a experience you have to have in Santo Domingo.",
          "The place is basically three blue lagoons inside a cavern, where to get there you have go down using a huge rock stair. Once you get down, be prepare to be amaze by this beautiful and well kept spot. You can not swim there, it's against the law, but you will see water a blue",

          "We liked this cave and it's crystal clear water. The steps are not really that difficult as you have few floors. You can take a boat trip down there if you have enough time. Please note that it's not allowed to swim over there.",
          "Nature is our best provider of beauty. This is a very different Pucture because we don't see it often. Three small lakes, called Eyes, with deep turquoise water due to minerals. Exhuberant folliage and way down many steps. One of the eyes is under rocks and stalactites. I",
          "This was an extraordinary adventure, the only bad observation that i can write is when you finish the trip, you cross like a store and the people is very annoying there but it was an excellent place!!!",
          "It was great. No need for tour guide just explore by yourselves. Really cheap, close to the city adventure. Really underrated not many people not even locals (as i used to be one of them) know about this paradise 5 mins away from the city",
          "This was our Most favorite part and location of the entire vacation. It is absolute splendor in photos, but once you see it in real life, you will never forget how enchanted you felt. The beautiful stone and forestry really takes you to a different time period. It feels like a",
          "Very pleasant experience. Cheap entry prices, and great photo ops. Takes about 15 minutes to walk through and see all 4 lakes. Pay the 25 pesos per person to take the boat to the 4th eye. Comes to less than a dollar and it is the prettiest of the 4 lakes",
          "How fascinating to have caves in the city!! There is a fee to entrace, but its worth it! There are actually 4 cave, the 4th one is actually the biggest one and most beautiful. Under the cave, it is very humid. So do bring some water.",
          "Must see attraction! These caves were amazing to see especially in the heart of Santo Domingo. Must be fit for those stairs.",
          "It is no longer possible to swim in the caves.but the visit is quite nice the worst part without a doubt is hyper souvenir vendors the visit is worte because the beuaty of the cave",
          "The 3 Eyes national park is really a site to see. It's interesting to think about how people lived in the past and where they gathered for shelter. This park is quite pretty and breathtaking. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes and bring your water with you. I suggest going on",

          "I fell in LOVE with this place. I truly enjoyed every second I spend in the caves. It is absolutely beautiful and for me, It is a must do in Santo Domingo. There are A LOT of stairs, so be prepared to climb them, but it is totally worth it. The most beautiful lake is only",

          "Los Tres Ojos National Park is a small park amongst the suburbs of Santo Domingo. Despite the nearby sounds of traffic, it's easy to focus on the nature as it is simply gorgeous. There are four lakes/sink holes to visit, all with crystal clear waters amongst jungle like",

          "Went as part of a tour from Punta Cana. It was my favorite part of the tour. Loved the 4th lake the best. The 3 eyes are beautiful, worth seeing!",
          "This is one of the most beautiful places of the Dominican Republic. The place is well maintained and clean. The entrance fee is $100 pesos and there is a lot of humidity, making you sweat a lot. Since there are a lot of stairs to go down, then up, you have to take your time in",
          "Interesting park, only 100 peso entry there are guides, but we did not get one. My 9 year old liked it to. Good for photography.",
          "Tres Ojos is basically a beautiful cave with underground lakes, and a secluded other lake which you can reach through the cave, it's magical! Don't book any tours, if you want it can be very cheap to go there! Take the OMSA bus on the big road near Palace Nacional, (near Zona",
          "Inexpensive and beautifully maintained grounds and caves. This was a great place to visit, and allowed us to escape the incredibly difficult noise and traffic of Santo Domingo. Parking was free, easily accessed, and supervised by park guards. Avoid the handicraft pavilion",
          "This place is so cool! If you are in Santo Domingo and enjoy the outdoors at all check it out. It is only 100 pesos per person to get in, but bring an extra 25 per person for a little cave boat ride. Lots of stairs but the cavern and the pools are breathtaking.",
          "the caves the colos of the water cause by sulfer are very impresive and i think is one of the preeties places i ever seen of natue",
          "These underground limestone caves are an amazing place, with four crystal clear lakes called \"ojos\". A must do when you visit Santo Domingo.",
          "This is a must see if you're in the area. It was absolutely beautiful. There are a lot of stairs to go up and down but it was totally worth it.",
          "It's really nice to appreciated the different color can take the water according its environment. You can find 4 lakes, each of one have their own charm. I like a lot the Azufre and las Damas or Women... The walk is pretty short although you have to walk through many stairs",
          "One of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. DO NOT waste money on paying for a tour guide... Do it on your own....they will bully you into paying $40",
          "You will not want to miss out on this tour if you don't plan on taking other cave tours while in the DR. The underground pools are fantasy-like. Don't pass up the little boat ride to the Hidden Lake.",
          "This was an amazing experience. They say the waters are curative and give you youth. If so the case, when I went back to work people told me I had a great glow and looked younger :) Its hummed but does wonders to your skin. So make sure u take ice water! If you buy things make",
          "It's a very beautiful place to visit. The employees were the worst. As we payed the entrance fee we were automatically introduced to a spokesperson who gave us great insight on all of the \u201ceyes\u201d. To watch the whole park, you need to pay an extra fee of 25 \u201cPesos\u201d ($1.00 = 45.00",
          "Tricky to get here because of the highway system in the country, but I was blown away with the beauty of this place. Even in 2016 and in the middle of the city, it looks like untouched earth. AMAZING!",
          "This place was cool. The waters were beautiful and the local guide at the large lake was informative and personable. If you're into jurassic park at all, you'll love it as they filmed part of the first movie at the big lake. Wear sneakers or sport sandals if you can. There",
          "This sit has a numerous stairs, little ones will be super tired on the first site to go down. Bottled water suggested, b/c there werent locals selling any. I took myself like an 1 to do the whole site and felt short. Health condition is a plus, to have a nice exercise outting.",
          "The three eyes is a place where you find natural beauty. Stalactites, stalagmites, waters eyes into beautiful caves. The eyes are beautiful. It worths the visit. It's a different place to visit in DR. You can't find this beauty everywhere. When you go, wear fresh clothes",
          "Arriving at the site I didn't have very high expectations but once I started to descend into the \"pit\" area, wow was I surprised! Amazing clear blue pools (3....obviously), interesting rocks/stalactites/stalagmites. In one pool you can take short floating pontoon across it to",
          "We went during a week day. No one was there. We only spent about an hour. There are 4 lakes. 3 inside caves and another that is mostly outside a cave. Lake 4. Pretty cool to see. Don't drive a long way just for this but certainly if you're in santo Domingo...go.",
          "Small place with small lakes and one big lake with beautiful trees surrounding it. Unfortunately, there was power cut where the lights did not work in one of the lake when we went. They should have a back up generator. Right next to the road , so we could use public transport",
          "Until now, this park is only cool area for me! Inside of the cave so good as the name of here. There are three eyes like a tiny lake!!! Do come!",
          "I have visited Los Tres Ojos three times and still am not tired of it. Most recently I took my two daughters. We stayed in the Zona Colonial of Santo Domingo and took a taxi here and back for $1,200 pesos, which was about $26 American dollars. This is not a bad rate considering",
          "Truly a must visit. If only we were allowed to swim. The place is beautiful. The \"boat\" ride to the other pool added to the experience. That pool was worth it!!!!",
          "This place is awesome. The caves are amazing, the natural formations and the most amazing thing is just right 15 minutes away from the city center. You will definitely want to bring your camera and maybe some sport shoes. The entrance is really cheap and you may or may not hire",
          "Went here after Santo Dominigo tour, was quite interesting, such a shame you cant go for a dip, but the Cenote in Mexico were much better and in the sheer heat a dip in the cold water is what is needed, not here though.",
          "Is nice to be among the nature, see the caves and the species that live in the natural lakes. Was nice",
          "This is a beautiful park that is practically untouched. We had a great time. Don't miss the small boat ride to the 4th lagoon. The 4th lagoon is actually the nicest and it is the opening scene of the Jurassic Park movies. Buy your ticket there not ahead. There are really cheap",
          "Absolutely breathtaking. The water is gorgeous, the raft over to lake 4 was so fun, and we enjoyed getting to see a true piece of Dominican History. We had an amazing tour guide who was kind enough to allow us to take as many pictures as we wanted-and we wanted to take as many",
          "I highly highly recommend this nature site. The caves are amazing, there's a lot of exercise required, up and down stairs, is extremely humid inside, but it is all worth it.",
          "I was able to visit that natural beauty name 3 eyes. A wonderful water cave. Like the guide said that was the place they gilm jurassic park... Well i like it and they give you all explanation regarding the story of that cave.",
          "We enjoyed the view and the guide was very funny! We did have to walk up and down many stairs so wear comfortable shoes.",
          "Lots of stairs. I don't recommend this for anyone not steady on their feet. While I enjoyed the site it was very hard navigating the many steps.",
          "I love going off the beaten path. On our vacation we found this spot on yelp and it was absolutely stunning.",
          "it is a really nice place to visit, it is located in Santo domingo close to downtown, is a natural cave with blue water, perfect for taking pictures, the only bad thing is the people outside selling handcraft stuffs that get really annoying, besides that , it is a really nice",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I love to explore these national treasures wherever we go. I am so glad we did not miss our opportunity to see these caves/caverns. Do not skip this if you are visiting Santo Domingo for any reason!",
          "We were pleasantly surprised to find such a neat experience right in the middle of Santo Domingo. There are guides there waiting, but we didn't feel like we missed out by not hiring one. Really beautiful caves and lagoons. Plan for about an hour to complete.",
          "We came from Punta Cana in our rental car and wish we had realized that the park was on our way to the hotel we could have easily stopped on our way into or out of the city. Instead we used a taxi from our hotel to get there. When we arrived we realized that we could have",
          "Los Tres Ojos is definitely worth visiting if you're in Santo Domingo. The caves are unique and it's nice to see natural beauty within the busy city. The entrance is 100 pesos and the boat ride in the cave is 25 pesos. There are guides available, but they over charge and it's",
          "I really enjoyed the visit to the park. I would recommend to pay for the private tour, as you get much more out of your visit than just going at it alone. An adventure for all ages, as long as you are not afraid of the natural steps to go up and down the route and the humidity.",
          "Did some exploring on a business trip and ended up at the Three Eyes. This place is beautiful and majestic. Spectacular piece of history.",
          "If you combine The 3 Eyes National Park with Faro a Colon or with Cuevas de las Maravillas it\u00b4s going to be a great, balance and worthy experience.",
          "We were surprised at how close this was within Santo Domingo. It is a beautiful place to visit. Our guide spoke English and Spanish. Lots of stairs to climb, but nothing strenuous.",
          "I've never seen anything like this park. Breathtakingly blue water, deep caves, and hidden jungles. I would make sure to pay the extra fee to go across the large lake.",
          "A name that translates to three lakes park, they are referring to bodies of water inside the limestone caves, three different sites; Lago de Azufree, La Nevera and Las Damas located in the Mirador del Este park. I learned that at one time, these waters were swimmable but some",
          "This was a random stop we made on our way out of Santo Domingo and it was definitely worth it. The water was super beautiful and the caves were fascinating. It is worth it to pay the dollar to take the ride across the water. Interesting little point in the city.",
          "We stopped here on our way to the colonial zone. It was amazing! Definitely get a guide, they point out all the cool fossils and explain the history. Don't miss the final boat ride!",
          "We stopped here on a tour and were glad we did. But we are Seniors, and I have an unsteady gait. However, my brother is well-coordinated-----so, he can easily help when I need him. Thanks to his occasional help. we had a great time. Without his help, it would have been very",
          "Inexpensive place for a family of 4. 100 pesos each to get in. Spent about an hour walking around and it was great. Very clean and nice walking paths. Lots of stairs. Reminds us of cenotes in Mexico. We took others advice and did not get a guide, and we did not need one either.",
          "Cave with sweet water, stalagmites and vats. 500 years ago was used for Indians. Natural, arqueologic and beautiful place.",
          "This partially open cave is a beautiful natural phenomenon which is well worth visiting. The floor and walls of the cave are carpeted with lush tropical plants, and the aqua lakes are stunning. An interesting low-tech boat carries you through a dark cave-tunnel to a fourth lake,",
          "I came to this place one of the days I had off from my mission trip . I thought it was beautiful . Crystalline and breathtaking waters . If you have some time off try to stop by",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit (I think, because from the performance of the guide I could not tell or understand anything). I know that it's a place where the local Taino used to live but I could not see/hear anything besides the local guide struggling to explain",
          "It is a beautiful Natural monument, the guides here are very very nice, and very cheap. Is an easy attraction to get to.",
          "So worth to visit this 100% nature place right in the center of the busy capital. Although they call it 3 eyes for 3 lakes they have inside the cave, actually there is the 4th lake and it's so wonderful and the way to it so interesting.Highly recommend if you are a nature lover.",
          "This was one of the places that we visited, It was a place to spend a little time and a nice place to see. If you have bad knees this is not the place for you there are a lot of stairs to climb.",
          "Well inside this nice place, you will find beautifull blue water coming from inside the earth I think that ist one of the most interesting places if you go with friends or with family, be sure to take a boat and go around and make nice photos.",
          "We visited Tres Ojos with our mission team on the way to the airport. We had a little extra time so this was perfect. The park is not very big so it doesn't take much time to get around it. There are some beautiful sights and the price was moderate.",
          "This was my favorite thing to see in Santo Domingo! Be ready for a workout- there are a lot of stairs. Once down inside you can see crystal clear blue water in the pools. I would recommend taking the boat (for a small fee) across to see the final pool Stunning views. This",
          "It was ok, and part of a tour package for us. It was not worth the time, not much to see and I would have rather spent more time touring the Zona Colonial for the amount of time we had in Santo Domingo. The tour takes less than an hour but you really only see the area around",
          "This was a pretty cool place to check out, especially if you don't have much else to do. It doesn't take a really long time to see all of it and it isn't really big. It didn't exactly knock my socks off with excitement and wonder but it was decent...like the title says. You",
          "Nice place to spend 1h, take some pics and see how it used to be before the asphalt jungle took over the land. If it was possible to take a swim, it would be great!",

I would highly recommend going early to avoid the hottest hours of the day as there isn't much of a breeze down by the pools and the air is stuffy.

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

        "wiki": "Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries of the Americas and elsewhere which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas on October 12, 1492 (Julian Calendar; it would have been October 21, 1492 on the Gregorian Proleptic Calendar, which extends the Gregorian Calendar to dates prior to its adoption in 1582). Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer and colonizer on behalf of Spain, who set sail across the Atlantic Ocean in search of a faster route to the Far East only to land at the New World. His first voyage to the New World on the Spanish ships Santa Mar\u00eda, Ni\u00f1a, and La Pinta took approximately three months. Columbus and his crew's arrival to the New World initiated the Columbian Exchange which introduced the transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, and technology (but also invasive species, including communicable diseases) between the New World and the Old World.\nThe landing is celebrated as Columbus Day in the United States but the name varies on the international spectrum. In some Latin American countries, October 12 is known as D\u00eda de la Raza or (Day of the Race). This is the case for Mexico, which inspired Jose Vasconcelos's book celebrating the Day of the Iberoamerican Race. Some countries such as Spain refer the holiday as D\u00eda de la Hispanidad and Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a where it is also the religious festivity of la Virgen del Pilar. Since 2009, Peru has celebrated D\u00eda de los pueblos originarios y el di\u00e1logo intercultural (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day). Belize and Uruguay celebrate it as D\u00eda de las Am\u00e9ricas (Day of the Americas). Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo or Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo is the formal name of Italy's celebration as well as in Little Italys around the world.\n\n\n== United States observance ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nCelebration of Christopher Columbus' voyage in the early United States is recorded from as early as 1792. In that year, the Tammany Society in New York City (for whom it became an annual tradition) and the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landing in the New World.For the 400th anniversary in 1892, following a lynching in New Orleans where a mob had murdered 11 Italian immigrants, President Benjamin Harrison declared Columbus Day as a one-time national celebration. The proclamation was part of a wider effort after the lynching incident to placate Italian Americans and ease diplomatic tensions with Italy. During the anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These rituals took themes such as citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and the celebration of social progress, included among them was the Pledge of Allegiance by Francis Bellamy.Many Italian-Americans observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, and the first such celebration had already been held in New York City on October 12, 1866. The day was first enshrined as a legal holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first statewide holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905, and it was made a statutory holiday in 1907.In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus and New York City Italian leader Generoso Pope, Congress passed a statute stating: \"The President is requested to issue each year a proclamation (1) designating October 12 as Columbus Day; (2) calling on United States Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Columbus Day; and (3) inviting the people of the United States to observe Columbus Day, in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies that express the public sentiment befitting the anniversary of the discovery of America.\" President Franklin Delano Roosevelt responded by making such a proclamation. This proclamation did not lead to the modern federal holiday. It was similar to language regarding Thomas Jefferson's Birthday and Gold Star Mothers Day.\nIn 1966, Mariano A. Lucca, from Buffalo, NY, founded the National Columbus Day Committee, which lobbied to make Columbus Day a federal holiday. These efforts were successful and Columbus Day became a federal holiday in 1968.Since 1971 (Oct. 11), the holiday has been attributed to the second Monday in October, coincidentally exactly the same day as Thanksgiving in neighboring Canada since 1957. It is generally observed nowadays by banks, the bond market, the U.S. Postal Service, other federal agencies, most state government offices, many businesses, and most school districts. Some businesses and some stock exchanges remain open, and some states and municipalities abstain from observing the holiday. The traditional date of the holiday also adjoins the anniversary of the United States Navy (founded October 13, 1775), and thus both occasions are customarily observed by the Navy and the Marine Corps with either a 72- or 96-hour liberty period.\n\n\n=== Local observance of Columbus Day ===\n\nActual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete non-observance. Most states do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday.  Some mark it as a \"Day of Observance\" or \"Recognition.\u201d Most states that celebrate Columbus Day will close state services, while others operate as normal.San Francisco claims the nation's oldest continuously existing celebration with the Italian-American community's annual Columbus Day Parade, which was established by Nicola Larco in 1868, while New York City boasts the largest, with over 35,000 marchers and one million viewers around 2010.As in the mainland United States, Columbus Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, the day is celebrated as both Columbus Day and \"Puerto Rico Friendship Day.\"Virginia also celebrates two legal holidays on the day, Columbus Day and Yorktown Victory Day, which honors the final victory at the Siege of Yorktown in the Revolutionary War.\n\n\n=== Non-observance ===\nThe celebration of Columbus Day in the United States began to decline at the end of the 20th century, although many Italian-Americans and others continue to champion it. The states of Florida, Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, South Dakota, New Mexico, Maine, Wisconsin, and parts of California including, for example, Los Angeles County do not recognize it and have each replaced it with celebrations of Indigenous People's Day (in Hawaii, \"Discoverers' Day\", in South Dakota, \"Native American Day\").  A lack of recognition or a reduced level of observance for Columbus Day is not always due to concerns about honoring Native Americans. For example, a community of predominantly Scandinavian descent may observe Leif Erikson Day instead. In the states of Oregon and Washington, Columbus Day is not an official holiday.Iowa and Nevada do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official holiday, but the states' respective governors are \"authorized and requested\" by statute to proclaim the day each year. Several states have removed the day as a paid holiday for state government workers, while maintaining it either as a day of recognition, or as a legal holiday for other purposes, including California and Texas.The practice of U.S. cities eschewing Columbus Day to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day began in 1992 with Berkeley, California. The list of cities which have followed suit as of 2018 includes Austin, Boise, Cincinnati, Denver, Los Angeles, Mankato, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Seattle, St. Paul, Minnesota, Phoenix, Tacoma, and \"dozens of others.\" Columbus, Ohio has chosen to honor veterans instead of Christopher Columbus, and removed Columbus Day as a city holiday. Various tribal governments in Oklahoma designate the day as Native American Day, or name it after their own tribe.\n\n\n== Latin American observance ==\n\n\n=== D\u00eda de la Raza ===\n\nThe date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in some countries of Latin America. The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including some Latin American communities in the United States) is the D\u00eda de la Raza (\"day of the race\" or the \"day of the [Hispanic] people\"), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and the Native Americans. The day was first celebrated in Argentina in 1917, in Venezuela and Colombia in 1921, in Chile in 1922 and in Mexico it was first celebrated in 1928. The day was also celebrated under this title in Spain until 1957, when it was changed to the D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (\"Hispanicity Day\"), and in Venezuela it was celebrated under this title until 2002, when it was changed to the D\u00eda de la Resistencia Ind\u00edgena (Day of Indigenous Resistance). Originally conceived of as a celebration of Hispanic influence in the Americas, as evidenced by the complementary celebrations in Spain and Latin America, D\u00eda de la Raza has come to be seen by nationalist activists throughout Latin America as a counter to Columbus Day; a celebration of the native races and cultures and their resistance to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.In the United States, D\u00eda de la Raza has served as a time of mobilization for pan-ethnic Latino activists, particularly since the 1960s. Since then, La Raza has served as a periodic rallying cry for Hispanic activists. The first Hispanic March on Washington occurred on Columbus Day in 1996. The name is used by the largest Hispanic social justice organization in the nation, the National Council of La Raza.\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\nThe Day of the Race was established in Argentina in 1916 by a decree of President Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen. The name was changed to \"Day of Respect of Cultural Diversity\" by a presidential decree in 2010 issued by President Cristina Kirchner. The statue of Columbus was removed from its original position near the Casa Rosada and replaced by one of Juana Azurduy, a patriot and leader in the struggle for independence who had indigenous ancestors.\n\n\n=== Colombia ===\nColombia, whose name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates El d\u00eda de la Raza y de la Hispanidad (meaning \"Day of the Race and Hispanicity\") and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of \"the two worlds\" and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture.\n\n\n=== Peru ===\nIn Peru, it was known as D\u00eda del descubrimiento de Am\u00e9rica (\"Day of the discovery of America\"). Since 2009, it has been celebrated as D\u00eda de los pueblos originarios y el di\u00e1logo intercultural (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day).\n\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nBetween 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated D\u00eda de la Raza along with many other Latin American nations. The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez. In 2002, under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the holiday was changed to D\u00eda de la Resistencia Ind\u00edgena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples' resistance to European settlement.On October 12, 2004, a crowd of pro-government activists toppled a statue of Christopher Columbus by Rafael de la Cova in Caracas. The activists also sprayed allusive graffiti over its pedestal. The Walk where the statue had stood was renamed in 2008 \"Indigenous Resistance Walk\". Later a statue of an indigenous leader, Guaicaipuro, was erected on the plinth.\n\n\n=== Costa Rica ===\nOn September 21, 1994, Costa Rica changed the official holiday from D\u00eda de la Raza to D\u00eda del Encuentro de las Culturas (Day of the Encounter of Cultures) to recognize the mix of European, Native American (autochthonous populations), African and Asian cultures that constitute modern Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture and ethnicity. In accordance to the Costa Rican labor law, the holiday is observed on October 12. However, should this date coincide with a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, the employer shall agree that said holiday be postponed to the following Monday.\n\n\n== Caribbean observance ==\nOnly a handful of Caribbean countries observe holidays related to Columbus Day. In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan American Day. In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced by National Heroes Day. In 1937, Cuban President Federico Laredo Br\u00fa (1936\u20131940) spoke to the nation and countries of America in Cuba on October 12 commemorating Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World. Federico Laredo Br\u00fa spoke about Columbus' impact on the land and the future of its settlement. He ended his speech with venerating Christopher Columbus' efforts to colonize and establish settlements along the new front and the pride of ones nation. He added \"Por mi raza hablo mi espiritu,\" which translates to \"For my race my spirit called,\" in order to support the political infrastructure at the time.\n\n\n=== Columbus' Legacy in the Caribbean ===\n\nDecember 1937, Cuban president Federico Laredo Br\u00fa and Dominican Republic president Rafael Trujillo ordered a crew of aviators to travel through Latin America collecting funds from large capital cities for a monumental light house in the Dominican Republic. The exploration Escuadrilla Binacional Pro Faro de Col\u00f3n was inspired by Columbus's journey across the North Atlantic Ocean to America. The expedition consisted of three Stinson Reliant SR-9 borrowed from the Cuban Air Force - named Santa Mar\u00eda, Ni\u00f1a and La Pinta after the vessels commanded by Columbus - and a Curtiss Wright CW-19R from the Dominican military aviation named Colon after Columbus. On December 15, after visiting a majority of South America, their flight to the Peruvian capital Lima was hampered by an unexpected sandstorm. Two planes (Colon and La Pinta) were forced to land in Pisco and Ni\u00f1a disappeared in the storm. The Santa Maria was the only plane to reach Lima as planned, landing at Las Palmas on the day of the storm. After extensive searches, Nina radioed their whereabouts after their radio was damaged in the storm. The aircraft restrategized in Las Palmas and on December 29 their expedition took off from El Techo airport in Bogot\u00e1 en route to El Guabito airport in California. Later that day, the crew flew into an unexpected storm over the Valley of Cauca. With minimal visibility and poor navigation, Ni\u00f1a, La Pinta and Santa Maria crashed into high mountains, while Colon, unaware of the other aircraft, flew over the storm and safely made it to Panama City. The plane is preserved today as remembrance of the bravery of the crew and Christopher Columbus's journey.In 1992, in remembrance of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America, the Columbus Lighthouse, in Santo Domingo Este was inaugurated. The monument is both a mausoleum and a museum showcasing objects including a boat from Cuba and Colombian jewelry. Constructed of concrete, the monument is 680 feet (210 m) long. Its architecture is cross-shaped and represents the Christianization of the Americas. According to the Dominican authorities, remains of Christopher Columbus are sheltered at the lighthouse. However, Spanish authorities have proved through DNA tests that the remains in the Cathedral of Seville are the real remains of Columbus. The Dominican authorities haven't allowed the same DNA tests to be done to the remains in the lighthouse, so it is impossible to know if the remains of Columbus are divided or if the remains in the lighthouse belonged to another person.\n\n\n== European observance ==\n\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nSince the 18th century, many Italian communities in the Americas have observed the Discovery of the New World as a celebration of their heritage; Christopher Columbus (whose original, Italian name is \"Cristoforo Colombo\") was an Italian explorer, citizen of the Republic of Genoa.In Italy, Columbus Day has been officially celebrated since 2004. It is officially named Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo.\nThe \"Lega Navale Italiana\" has created a Regata di Colombo as a celebration of the Columbus achievement. Italians have celebrated their \"Cristoforo Colombo\" naming after him many civilian and military ships, like the ocean liner SS Cristoforo Colombo.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\n\nSince 1987, Spain has celebrated the anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas as its Fiesta Nacional or \"National Day\". Previously Spain had celebrated the day as D\u00eda de la Hispanidad, emphasizing Spain's ties with Hispanidad, the international Hispanic community. In 1981 a royal decree established the D\u00eda de la Hispanidad as a national holiday. However, in 1987 the name was changed to Fiesta Nacional, and October 12 became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6. Spain's \"national day\" had moved around several times during the various regime changes of the 20th century; establishing it on the day of the international Columbus celebration was part of a compromise between conservatives, who wanted to emphasize the status of the monarchy and Spain's history, and Republicans, who wanted to commemorate Spain's burgeoning democracy with an official holiday. Since 2000, October 12 has also been Spain's Day of the Armed Forces, celebrated each year with a military parade in Madrid. Other than this, however, the holiday is not widely or enthusiastically celebrated in Spain. There are no large-scale patriotic parades, marches or other events, but shops and businesses are closed as with other bank holidays. The observation is generally overshadowed by the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar (Fiestas del Pilar). This holiday was declared a religious feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730. In recent years, celebration of the holiday has faced some opposition from various organizations.\n\n\n== Opposition to Columbus celebrations ==\n\nOpposition to Columbus Day dates back to at least the 19th century, when anti-immigrant nativists sought to eliminate its celebration because of its association with immigrants from the Catholic countries of Ireland and Italy, and the American Catholic fraternal organization, the Knights of Columbus. Some anti-Catholics, notably including the Ku Klux Klan and the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, opposed celebrations of Columbus or monuments about him because they thought that it increased Catholic influence in the United States, which was largely a Protestant country.By far the more common opposition today, decrying both Columbus' and other Europeans' actions against the indigenous populations of the Americas, did not gain much traction until the latter half of the 20th century. This opposition was initially led by Native Americans and was expanded upon by left-wing political parties. Two surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 by Rasmussen Reports found 26% to 38% of American adults are not in favor of celebrating Columbus Day.There are many interrelated strands of criticism. One refers primarily to the treatment of the indigenous populations during the European colonization of the Americas which followed Columbus's discovery. Some groups, such as the American Indian Movement, have argued that the ongoing actions and injustices against Native Americans are masked by Columbus myths and celebrations. American anthropologist Jack Weatherford says that on Columbus Day, Americans celebrate the greatest waves of genocide of the American Indians known in history.\n\nA second strain of criticism of Columbus Day focuses on the character of Columbus himself. In time for the 2004 observation of the day, the final volume of a compendium of Columbus-era documents was published by the University of California, Los Angeles's Medieval and Renaissance Center. It stated that Columbus, while a brilliant mariner, exploited and enslaved the indigenous population.Spelman College historian Howard Zinn described some of the details of how Columbus personally ordered the enslavement and mutilation of the native Arawak people in a bid to repay his investors.Journalist and media critic Norman Solomon reflects, in Columbus Day: A Clash of Myth and History, that many people choose to hold on to the myths surrounding Columbus. He quotes from the logbook Columbus's initial description of the American Indians: \"They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance.... They would make fine servants.... With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.\" Solomon states that the most important contemporary documentary evidence is the multi-volume History of the Indies by the Catholic priest Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, who observed the region where Columbus was governor. In contrast to \"the myth,\" Solomon quotes Las Casas, who describes Spaniards driven by \"insatiable greed\"\u2014\"killing, terrorizing, afflicting, and torturing the native peoples\" with \"the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty\" and how systematic violence was aimed at preventing \"[American] Indians from daring to think of themselves as human beings.\" The Spaniards \"thought nothing of knifing [American] Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades,\" wrote Las Casas. \"My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write.\"In the summer of 1990, 350 representatives from American Indian groups from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first Intercontinental Gathering of Indigenous People in the Americas, to mobilize against the 500th anniversary (quin-centennial) celebration of Columbus Day planned for 1992. The following summer, in Davis, California, more than a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992 to be \"International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndigenous Peoples' Day\nAge of Discovery\nList of monuments and memorials to Christopher Columbus\nL'Anse aux Meadows\nLeif Erikson Day\nThanksgiving (Canada)\nUN Spanish Language Day\nWorld's Columbian Exposition\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBerkeley's Indigenous Peoples Day \u2013 History of the annual celebration, pow wow and Native American market\nToday in History: October 12 \u2013 An article about Columbus Day at the Library of Congress\nTransform Columbus Day Alliance \u2013 Denver-based organization with background on opposition to Columbus Day",

        "wiki": "The Dominican Republic ( d\u0259-MIN-ik-\u0259n; Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, pronounced [re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0omini\u02c8kana] (listen)) is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with Haiti, making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two sovereign states. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area (after Cuba) at 48,671 square kilometers (18,792 sq mi), and third-largest by population with approximately 10.5 million people (2020 est.), of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. The official language of the country is Spanish.\nThe native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans, dividing it into five chiefdoms. The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years, and lived around the Caribbean islands. The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization. Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island, landing here on his first voyage in 1492. The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Meanwhile, France occupied the western third of Hispaniola, naming their colony Saint-Domingue, which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804. After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821. The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia, but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822. Independence came 22 years later in 1844, after victory in the Dominican War of Independence. Over the next 72 years the Dominican Republic experienced mostly internal conflicts and a brief return to Spanish colonial status before permanently ousting the Spanish during the Dominican War of Restoration of 1863\u20131865. The United States occupied the country between 1916 and 1924; a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio V\u00e1squez followed. From 1930 the dictatorship of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo ruled until 1961. A civil war in 1965, the country's last, was ended by U.S. military occupation and was followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer (1966\u20131978 and 1986\u20131996). Since 1978, the Dominican Republic has moved toward representative democracy. Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic's current president, succeeded Fern\u00e1ndez in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent ex-president Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda.\nThe Dominican Republic has the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region and is the eighth-largest economy in Latin America. Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the Western Hemisphere \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.3% between 1992 and 2018. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, and a high level of remittances.\nThe Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions. A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature of 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity. The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, a World Heritage Site. Music and sport are of great importance in the Dominican culture, with Merengue and Bachata as the national dance and music, and baseball as the most popular sport.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe \"Dominican\" word comes from the Latin Dominicus, meaning Sunday. However, the island has this name by Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n (Saint Dominic), founder of the Order of the Dominicans.The Dominicans established a house of high studies on the island of Santo Domingo that is now known as the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo and dedicated themselves to the protection of the native Ta\u00edno people, who were subjected to slavery, and to the education of the inhabitants of the island.For most of its history, up until independence, the country was known as Santo Domingo \u2013 the name of its present capital and patron saint, Saint Dominic \u2013 and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century.  The residents were called \"Dominicans\" (Dominicanos), the adjectival form of \"Domingo\", and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country \"Dominican Republic\" (Rep\u00fablica Dominicana).\nIn the national anthem of the Dominican Republic (himno nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana), the term \"Dominicans\" does not appear. The author of its lyrics, Emilio Prud'Homme, consistently uses the poetic term \"Quisqueyans\" (Quisqueyanos). The word \"Quisqueya\" derives from a native tongue of the Ta\u00edno Indians and means \"Mother of the lands\" (Madre de las tierras). It is often used in songs as another name for the country. The name of the country is often shortened to \"the D.R.\" (la R.D.)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-European history ===\n\nThe Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno moved into Hispaniola from the north east region of what is now known as South America, displacing earlier inhabitants, c. 650 C.E. They engaged in farming and fishing and hunting and gathering. The fierce Caribs drove the Ta\u00edno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century. The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, and four hundred thousand to two million. Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist. By 1492, the island was divided into five Ta\u00edno chiefdoms. The Ta\u00edno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.The Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Ta\u00ednos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagar\u00edx, Guam\u00e1, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Ta\u00ednos had declined drastically, due to smallpox, measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans, and from other causes discussed below.\nThe first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507. The last record of pure Ta\u00ednos in the country was from 1864. Still, Ta\u00edno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Ta\u00edno women, and some present-day Dominicans have Ta\u00edno ancestry. Remnants of the Ta\u00edno culture include their cave paintings, (including the Pomier Caves) as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Hig\u00fcerito, Moca.\n\n\n=== European colonization ===\n\nChristopher Columbus arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his four voyages to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it La Espa\u00f1ola due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the Spanish landscape. Traveling further east, Columbus came across the Yaque del Norte River in the Cibao region, which he named Rio de Oro after discovering gold deposits nearby. On Columbus's return during his second voyage, he established the settlement of La Isabela in what is now Puerto Plata on Jan. 1494, while he sent Alonso de Ojeda to search for gold in the region.\nIn 1496, Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher's brother, built the city of Santo Domingo, Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the \"New World.\" The colony thus became the springboard for the further Spanish conquest of the Americas and for decades the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere. Soon after, the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the cordillera central region, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus's cousin Giovanni Columbus had also discovered gold near Buenaventura; the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along San Crist\u00f3bal-Buenaventura and another in Cibao within the La Vega-Cotuy-Bonao triangle, while Santiago de los Caballeros, Concepcion, and Bonao became mining towns.  The gold rush of 1500\u20131508 ensued. Ferdinand II of Aragon \"ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown.\" Thus, Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines, though placers were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the \"best Indians\" working his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Crist\u00f3bal mining area supervised by salaried miners.Under Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, \"where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed,\" according to Pons.  By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the encomienda system.  According to Pons, \"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out.\"  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepci\u00f3n, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The repartimiento of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000 of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.  By 1519, according to Pons, \"Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time.\"The southern city of Santo Domingo served as the administrative heart of the expanding Spanish empire. Conquistadors like Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. Sugar cane was introduced to Hispaniola from the Canary Islands, and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola. The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the Real Audiencia from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\nIn the 1560s, English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of Mexico and Peru, while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free people of color, and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding intermixing, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Ta\u00edno, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became one of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\nBy the mid-17th century, the French sent colonists and privateers to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the pirates, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony on the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer economic decline.On April 17, 1655, the English landed on Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to Santo Domingo, the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted lancers, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite defenders of Santo Domingo were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a smallpox epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later, Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards attacked the north and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nThe House of Bourbon replaced the House of Habsburg in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last flotas sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by the emigration of Spaniards from the Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 18th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number, approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) \u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Ta\u00ednos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island. In our veins runs the blood of the heroic conquistadores who won this island of ours with sword and blood.'\n\nWhen the War of Jenkins' Ear between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish privateers, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to troll the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe. As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural hateros (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the French Revolution. French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not in Europe (see War of the Pyrenees). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the Treaty of Basel (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nFrom 1795 to 1822, Santo Domingo (the city) changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained there until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's longtime opponent.In 1801, Toussaint Louverture, who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the Treaty of Basel. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. Charles Leclerc when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, Dessalines, attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General Christophe marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned. In October 1808 the landowner Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and Jamaica. A combined Anglo-Spanish force recaptured the territory in 1809. The Spaniards, upon re-establishing control, not only tried to re-establish slavery in Santo Domingo, but many of them also mounted raiding expeditions into Haiti to capture blacks and enslave them as well.\n\n\n=== Independence from Spain (1821) ===\n\nAfter a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, declared the colony's independence from the Spanish crown as Spanish Haiti, on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.\n\n\n=== Unification of Hispaniola (1822\u201344) ===\n\nThe newly independent republic ended two months later under the Haitian government led by Jean-Pierre Boyer.As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and Joseph Balthazar Inginac's Code Rural. In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\nThe Haitians associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.Haiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the Espa\u00f1a Boba period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Gran Colombia. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the cibao region. After independence, and eventually being under Spanish rule once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from Spain.\n\n\n=== Dominican War of Independence (1844) ===\n\nIn 1838, Juan Pablo Duarte founded a secret society called La Trinitaria, which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention. Also Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez and Ramon Matias Mella, despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence. Duarte, Mella, and S\u00e1nchez are considered the three Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic.The Trinitarios took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian Charles H\u00e9rard who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for H\u00e9rard and now championed Dominican independence. After overthrowing Boyer, H\u00e9rard executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped. After subduing the Dominicans, H\u00e9rard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in Port-au-Prince. Haiti had formed two regiments composed of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo; these were used by H\u00e9rard to suppress the uprising.\n\nOn February 27, 1844, the surviving members of La Trinitaria declared the independence from Haiti. They were backed by Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle rancher from El Seibo, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first Constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the United States Constitution. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and Buenaventura B\u00e1ez held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, \u201cin Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and...the number of wounded was very superior...[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.\u201dThe Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845. The Haitians invaded again in 1849 after France recognized the Dominican Republic as an independent nation. In an overwhelming onslaught, the Haitians seized one frontier town after another. Santana being called upon to assume command of the troops, met the enemy at Ocoa, April 21, 1849, with only 400 men, and succeeded in utterly defeating the Haitian army. In November 1849 B\u00e1ez launched a naval offensive against Haiti to forestall the threat of another invasion. His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. In 1855, Haiti invaded again, but its forces were repulsed at the bloodiest clashes in the history of the Dominican\u2013Haitian wars, the Battle of Santom\u00e9 in December 1855 and the Battle of Sabana Larga in January 1856.\n\n\n=== First Republic ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's first constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.  It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by Pedro Santana on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.Without adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, Manuel Jimenes.\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3 besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.\n\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to colonial status. This action was supported by the cattlemen of the south while the northern elites opposed it. Spanish rule finally came to an end with the War of Restoration in 1865, after four years of conflict between Dominican nationalists and Spanish sympathizers. The war claimed more than 50,000 lives.Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant ordered U.S. Marines to the island for the first time. Pirates operating from Haiti had been raiding U.S. commercial shipping in the Caribbean, and Grant directed the Marines to stop them at their source. Following the virtual takeover of the island, B\u00e1ez offered to sell the country to the United States. Grant desired a naval base at Saman\u00e1 and also a place for resettling newly freed Blacks. The treaty, which included U.S. payment of $1.5 million for Dominican debt repayment, was defeated in the United States Senate in 1870 on a vote of 28\u201328, two-thirds being required.B\u00e1ez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and B\u00e1ez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General Ulises Heureaux.\"Lil\u00eds\", as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, \"a consummate dissembler\", who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular. In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the Dominican economy. The sugar industry was modernized, and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants.\n\n\n=== 20th century (1900\u201330) ===\n\nFrom 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.United States President Theodore Roosevelt sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future Panama Canal, as the canal was already under construction. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.\n\nAfter six years in power, President Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres (who had himself assassinated Heureaux) was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899\u20131902) Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former Secretary of War Desiderio Arias maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.\n\nWilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. U.S. Marines landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Vice Admiral Harry Shepard Knapp, was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces. The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President Warren G. Harding (1921\u201323), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.\n\nThe victor was former president (1902\u201303) Horacio V\u00e1squez, who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924 and the last U.S. forces left in September. In six years, the Marines were involved in at least 467 engagements, with 950 insurgents killed or wounded in action. V\u00e1squez gave the country six years of stable governance, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a relatively peaceful atmosphere.During the government of Horacio V\u00e1squez, Rafael Trujillo held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Pe\u00f1a, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez.\nIn February 1930, when V\u00e1squez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a; in return for letting Ure\u00f1a take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.\nAs per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.\n\n\n=== Trujillo Era (1930\u201361) ===\n\nThere was considerable economic growth during Rafael Trujillo's long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935 and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. Trujillo renamed Santo Domingo to \"Ciudad Trujillo\" (Trujillo City), the nation's \u2013 and the Caribbean's \u2013 highest mountain La Pelona Grande (Spanish for: The Great Bald) to \"Pico Trujillo\" (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak), and many towns and a province. Some other places he renamed after members of his family. By the end of his first term in 1934 he was the country's wealthiest person, and one of the wealthiest in the world by the early 1950s; near the end of his regime his fortune was an estimated $800 million. He used the secret police extensively to eliminate political opposition and to prevent several coup attempts during and after World War II. The secret police allegedly murdered more than 500,000 people during the Trujillo era.\nAlthough one-quarter Haitian, Trujillo promoted propaganda against Haitian people. In 1937, he ordered what became known as the Parsley Massacre or, in the Dominican Republic, as El Corte (The Cutting), directing the army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border. The army killed an estimated 17,000 to 35,000 Haitian men, women, and children over six days, from the night of October 2, 1937, through October 8, 1937. To avoid leaving evidence of the army's involvement, the soldiers used edged weapons rather than guns. The soldiers were said to have interrogated anyone with dark skin, using the shibboleth perejil (parsley) to distinguish Haitians from Afro-Dominicans when necessary; the 'r' of perejil was of difficult pronunciation for Haitians. As a result of the massacre, the Dominican Republic agreed to pay Haiti US$750,000, later reduced to US$525,000. In 1938, reports from the Dominican Republic revealed hundreds more Haitians had been killed and thousands deported.\nOn November 25, 1960, Trujillo killed three of the four Mirabal sisters, nicknamed Las Mariposas (The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia Mar\u00eda Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings, as did their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to Provincia Hermanas Mirabal (Mirabal Sisters Province). The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.\nFor a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, a fierce critic of Trujillo.Trujillo had become expendable. Dissidents inside the Dominican Republic argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo.According to Chester Bowles, the U.S. Undersecretary of State, internal Department of State discussions in 1961 on the topic were vigorous. Richard N. Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, who had direct contacts with the rebel alliance, argued for intervention against Trujillo. Quoting Bowles directly: The next morning I learned that in spite of the clear decision against having the dissident group request our assistance Dick Goodwin following the meeting sent a cable to CIA people in the Dominican Republic without checking with State or CIA; indeed, with the protest of the Department of State. The cable directed the CIA people in the Dominican Republic to get this request at any cost. When Allen Dulles found this out the next morning, he withdrew the order. We later discovered it had already been carried out.\n\n\n=== Post-Trujillo (1962\u20131996) ===\n\nTrujillo was assassinated on May 30, 1961 with weapons supplied by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist Juan Bosch took office but it was overthrown in September. On April 24, 1965, after 19 months of military rule, a pro-Bosch revolt broke out.Days later U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, concerned that Communists might take over the revolt and create a \"second Cuba,\" sent the Marines, followed immediately by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division and other elements of the XVIIIth Airborne Corps, in Operation Powerpack. \"We don't propose to sit here in a rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up any government in the western hemisphere,\" Johnson said. The forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents from the Organization of American States. All these remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer. He had been Trujillo's last puppet-president.\n\nThe Dominican death toll for the entire period of civil war and occupation totaled more than three thousand, many of them black civilians killed when the US-backed military junta engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the northern (also the industrial) part of Santo Domingo.Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included the construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive Columbus Lighthouse, completed in 1992 during a later tenure.\nDuring Balaguer's administration, the Dominican military forced Haitians to cut sugarcane on Dominican sugar plantations (bateyes).In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez, of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under Salvador Jorge Blanco. Under the PRD presidents, the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of relative freedom and basic human rights.\nBalaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, a former mayor of Santo Domingo. The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa.\n\n\n=== 1996\u2013present ===\n\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez achieved the first-ever win for the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD (which he also had founded). Fern\u00e1ndez oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.In 2000, the PRD's Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda won the election. This was a time of economic troubles. Mej\u00eda was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004 by Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the PLD. In 2008, Fern\u00e1ndez was as elected for a third term. Fern\u00e1ndez and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, such as the construction of the Metro Railway (\"El Metro\"). On the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.Danilo Medina of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016. On the other hand, a significant increase in crime, government corruption and a weak justice system threaten to overshadow their administrative period.The Dominican Republic has the ninth-largest economy in Latin America and is the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region. Over the last two decades, the Dominican Republic has had one of the fastest-growing economies in the Americas \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.4% between 1992 and 2014. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, as well as a high level of remittances.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic comprises the eastern five-eighths of Hispaniola, the second-largest island in the Greater Antilles, with the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with Haiti, the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being 376 km (234 mi). To the north and north-west lie The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and to the east, across the Mona Passage, the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The country's area is reported variously as 48,442 km2 (18,704 sq mi) (by the embassy in the United States) and 48,670 km2 (18,792 sq mi), making it the second largest country in the Antilles, after Cuba. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest city Santo Domingo is on the southern coast.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the Cordillera Septentrional (\"Northern Mountain Range\"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of Monte Cristi, near the Haitian border, to the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic \u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies \u2013 is the Cordillera Central (\"Central Mountain Range\"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of Azua, on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: Pico Duarte (3,098 metres or 10,164 feet above sea level), La Pelona (3,094 metres or 10,151 feet), La Rucilla (3,049 metres or 10,003 feet), and Pico Yaque (2,760 metres or 9,055 feet). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the Sierra de Neiba, while in the south the Sierra de Bahoruco is a continuation of the Massif de la Selle in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the Cordillera Oriental (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda, Sierra de Yamas\u00e1, and Sierra de Saman\u00e1.\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile Cibao valley. This major valley is home to the cities of Santiago and La Vega and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the Enriquillo Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the Constanza, Jarabacoa, Villa Altagracia, and Bonao valleys.\nThe Llano Costero del Caribe (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the savannahs that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the Plena de Azua (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in Azua Province. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the Pedernales Peninsula.\n\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The Yaque del Norte is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the Yuna River serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, tributary of the Yaque del Sur, which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The Artibonito is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is Enriquillo, a salt lake at 45 metres (148 ft) below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n or Cabral, with fresh water, and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with brackish water.\nThere are many small offshore islands and cays that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are Saona, in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. Smaller islands include the Cayos Siete Hermanos, Isla Cabra, Cayo Jackson, Cayo Lim\u00f3n, Cayo Levantado, Cayo la Bocaina, Catalanita, Cayo Pisaje and Isla Alto Velo. To the north, at distances of 100\u2013200 kilometres (62\u2013124 mi), are three extensive, largely submerged banks, which geographically are a southeast continuation of the Bahamas: Navidad Bank, Silver Bank, and Mouchoir Bank. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic. Isla Cabritos lies within Lago Enriquillo.\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered a magnitude 8.1 earthquake off the northeast coast, triggering a tsunami that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a tropical rainforest climate in the coastal and lowland areas. Due to its diverse topography, Dominican Republic's climate shows considerable variation over short distances and is the most varied of all the Antilles. The annual average temperature is 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). At higher elevations the temperature averages 18 \u00b0C (64.4 \u00b0F) while near sea level the average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F). Low temperatures of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) are possible in the mountains while high temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are possible in protected valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the year while August is the hottest month. Snowfall can be seen on rare occasions on the summit of Pico Duarte.The wet season along the northern coast lasts from November through January. Elsewhere the wet season stretches from May through November, with May being the wettest month. Average annual rainfall is 1,500 millimetres (59.1 in) countrywide, with individual locations in the Valle de Neiba seeing averages as low as 350 millimetres (13.8 in) while the Cordillera Oriental averages 2,740 millimetres (107.9 in). The driest part of the country lies in the west.Tropical cyclones strike the Dominican Republic every couple of years, with 65% of the impacts along the southern coast. Hurricanes are most likely between June and October. The last major hurricane that struck the country was Hurricane Georges in 1998.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a representative democracy or democratic republic, with three branches of power: executive, legislative, and judicial. The president of the Dominican Republic heads the executive branch and executes laws passed by the congress, appoints the cabinet, and is commander in chief of the armed forces. The president and vice-president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for 4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of a senate, which has 32 members, and the Chamber of Deputies, with 178 members.Judicial authority rests with the Supreme Court of Justice's 16 members. They are appointed by a council composed of the president, the leaders of both houses of Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, and an opposition or non\u2013governing-party member. The court \"alone hears actions against the president, designated members of his Cabinet, and members of Congress when the legislature is in session.\"The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system. Elections are held every two years, alternating between the presidential elections, which are held in years evenly divisible by four, and the congressional and municipal elections, which are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four. \"International observers have found that presidential and congressional elections since 1996 have been generally free and fair.\" The Central Elections Board (JCE) of nine members supervises elections, and its decisions are unappealable. Starting from 2016, elections will be held jointly, after a constitutional reform.\n\n\n=== Political culture ===\nThe three major parties are the conservative Social Christian Reformist Party (Spanish: Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC)), in power 1966\u201378 and 1986\u201396; and the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD)), in power in 1963, 1978\u201386, and 2000\u201304; and the Dominican Liberation Party (Spanish: Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (PLD)), in power 1996\u20132000 and since 2004.\nThe presidential elections of 2008 were held on May 16, 2008, with incumbent Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez winning 53% of the vote. He defeated Miguel Vargas Maldonado, of the PRD, who achieved a 40.48% share of the vote. Amable Aristy, of the PRSC, achieved 4.59% of the vote. Other minority candidates, which included former Attorney General Guillermo Moreno from the Movement for Independence, Unity and Change (Spanish: Movimiento Independencia, Unidad y Cambio (MIUCA)), and PRSC former presidential candidate and defector Eduardo Estrella, obtained less than 1% of the vote.\nIn the 2012 presidential elections, the incumbent president Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez (PLD) declined his aspirations and instead the PLD elected Danilo Medina as its candidate. This time the PRD presented ex-president Hipolito Mejia as its choice. The contest was won by Medina with 51.21% of the vote, against 46.95% in favor of Mejia. Candidate Guillermo Moreno obtained 1.37% of the votes.In 2014, the Modern Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido revolucionario Moderno) was created by a faction of leaders from the PRD and has since become the predominant opposition party, polling in second place for the upcoming May 2016 general elections.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a close relationship with the United States, mostly with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and with the other states of the Inter-American system.\nThe Dominican Republic's relationship with neighbouring Haiti is strained over mass Haitian migration to the Dominican Republic, with citizens of the Dominican Republic blaming the Haitians for increased crime and other social problems. The Dominican Republic is a regular member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.\nThe Dominican Republic has a Free Trade Agreement with the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua via the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement. And an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union and the Caribbean Community via the Caribbean Forum.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nCongress authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. Approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The commander in chief of the military is the president.\nThe army is larger than the other services combined with approximately 56,780 active duty personnel, consisting of six infantry brigades, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. The Dominican Republic has the largest military in the Caribbean region surpassing Cuba.The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The secretary of the armed forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). The armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.In 2018, Dominican Republic signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces. Santo Domingo, the capital, is designated Distrito Nacional (National District). The provinces are divided into municipalities (municipios; singular municipio). They are the second-level political and administrative subdivisions of the country. The president appoints the governors of the 31 provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124 municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo). They are elected at the same time as congressional representatives.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the largest economy (according to the U.S. State Department and the World Bank) in the Caribbean and Central American region. It is an upper middle-income developing country, with a 2015 GDP per capita of US$14,770, in PPP terms. Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the Americas \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.53% between 1992 and 2018. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4%. As of 2015, the average wage in nominal terms is US$392 per month (RD$17,829). The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine.During the last three decades, the Dominican economy, formerly dependent on the export of agricultural commodities (mainly sugar, cocoa and coffee), has transitioned to a diversified mix of services, manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and trade. The service sector accounts for almost 60% of GDP; manufacturing, for 22%; tourism, telecommunications and finance are the main components of the service sector; however, none of them accounts for more than 10% of the whole. The Dominican Republic has a stock market, Bolsa de Valores de la Republica Dominicana (BVRD). and advanced telecommunication system and transportation infrastructure. High unemployment and income inequality are long-term challenges. International migration affects the Dominican Republic greatly, as it receives and sends large flows of migrants. Mass illegal Haitian immigration and the integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues. A large Dominican diaspora exists, mostly in the United States, contributes to development, sending billions of dollars to Dominican families in remittances.Remittances in Dominican Republic increased to US$4571.30 million in 2014 from US$3333 million in 2013 (according to data reported by the Inter-American Development Bank). Economic growth takes place in spite of a chronic energy shortage, which causes frequent blackouts and very high prices. Despite a widening merchandise trade deficit, tourism earnings and remittances have helped build foreign exchange reserves. Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation until 2002, after which the economy entered a recession.This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest commercial bank in the country, Baninter, linked to a major incident of fraud valued at US$3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%. All defendants, including the star of the trial, Ram\u00f3n B\u00e1ez Figueroa (the great-grandson of President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez), were convicted.\nAccording to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked No. 71 in the world for resource availability, No. 79 for human development, and No. 14 in the world for resource mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.\nThe Dominican Republic has a noted problem of child labor in its coffee, rice, sugarcane, and tomato industries. The labor injustices in the sugarcane industry extend to forced labor according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Three large groups own 75% of the land: the State Sugar Council (Consejo Estatal del Az\u00facar, CEA), Grupo Vicini, and Central Romana Corporation.According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 104,800 people are enslaved in the modern day Dominican Republic, or 1.00% of the population. Some slaves in the Dominican Republic are held on sugar plantations, guarded by men on horseback with rifles, and forced to work.\n\n\n=== Currency ===\n\nThe Dominican peso (abbreviated $ or RD$; ISO 4217 code is \"DOP\") is the national currency, with the United States dollar, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc also accepted at most tourist sites. The exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, liberalized by 1985, stood at 2.70 pesos per dollar in August 1986, 14.00 pesos in 1993, and 16.00 pesos in 2000. As of September 2018 the rate was 50.08 pesos per dollar.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions. A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature of 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity. The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, a World Heritage Site.Tourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean. With the construction of projects like Cap Cana, San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, Casa De Campo and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in Punta Cana, the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\nEcotourism has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like Jarabacoa and neighboring Constanza, and locations like the Pico Duarte, Bahia de las Aguilas, and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries are required to get a tourist card, depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10 km from the Haitian border.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are DR-1, DR-2, and DR-3, which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur (DR-5) or alternative routes (DR-4).\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa \u2013 Constanza) and DR-12 (Constanza \u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the Santiago light rail system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a rapid transit system in Santo Domingo, the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular Caribbean and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open as of August 2013, is 27.35 kilometres (16.99 mi). Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a well developed telecommunications infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and landline services. Cable Internet and DSL are available in most parts of the country, and many Internet service providers offer 3G wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes downstream/upstream speed; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend Wi-Fi hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the digital spectrum, via HD Radio and HDTV after officially adopting ATSC as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones).\nThe largest telecommunications company is Claro \u2013 part of Carlos Slim's Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil \u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and IPTV services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP. There were 2,439,997 Internet users in March 2009.In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a \"gender perspective\" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. This is part of the regional eLAC2010 plan. The tool the Dominicans have chosen to design and evaluate all the public policies is the APC Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM).\n\n\n=== Electricity ===\n\nElectric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez. The recent investment in a 345 kilovolt \"Santo Domingo\u2013Santiago Electrical Highway\" with reduced transmission losses, is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.\nDuring the Trujillo regime electrical service was introduced to many cities. Almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and most do not pay or pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 volts alternating at 60 Hz. Electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the Dominican Republic has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure. Concentrated efforts were announced to increase efficiency of delivery to places where the collection rate reached 70%. The electricity sector is highly politicized. Some generating companies are undercapitalized and at times unable to purchase adequate fuel supplies.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's population was 10,627,141 in 2018. In 2010, 31.2% of the population was under 15 years of age, with 6% of the population over 65 years of age. There were an estimated 102.3 males for every 100 females in 2020. The annual population growth rate for 2006\u20132007 was 1.5%, with the projected population for the year 2015 being 10,121,000.The population density in 2007 was 192 per km2 (498 per sq mi), and 63% of the population lived in urban areas. The southern coastal plains and the Cibao Valley are the most densely populated areas of the country. The capital city Santo Domingo had a population of 2,907,100 in 2010.Other important cities are Santiago de los Caballeros (pop. 745,293), La Romana (pop. 214,109), San Pedro de Macor\u00eds (pop. 185,255), Hig\u00fcey (153,174), San Francisco de Macor\u00eds (pop. 132,725), Puerto Plata (pop. 118,282), and La Vega (pop. 104,536). Per the United Nations, the urban population growth rate for 2000\u20132005 was 2.3%.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nIn a 2014 population survey, 70.4% self-identified as mixed (mestizo/indio 58%, mulatto 12.4%), 15.8% as black, 13.5% as white, and 0.3% as \"other\". Ethnic immigrant groups in the country include West Asians\u2014mostly Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians. East Asians, primarily ethnic Chinese and Japanese, can also be found. Europeans are represented mostly by Spanish whites but also with smaller populations of German Jews, Italians, Portuguese, British, Dutch, Danes, and Hungarians. Some converted Sephardic Jews from Spain were part of early expeditions; only Catholics were allowed to come to the New World. Later there were Jewish migrants coming from the Iberian peninsula and other parts of Europe in the 1700s. Some managed to reach the Caribbean as refugees during and after the Second World War. Some Sephardic Jews reside in Sos\u00faa while others are dispersed throughout the country. Self-identified Jews number about 3,000; other Dominicans may have some Jewish ancestry because of marriages among converted Jewish Catholics and other Dominicans since the colonial years. Some Dominicans born in the United States now reside in the Dominican Republic, creating a kind of expatriate community.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe population of the Dominican Republic is mostly Spanish-speaking. The local variant of Spanish is called Dominican Spanish, which closely resembles other Spanish vernaculars in the Caribbean and has similarities to Canarian Spanish. In addition, it has influences from African languages and borrowed words from indigenous Caribbean languages particular to the island of Hispaniola. Schools are based on a Spanish educational model; English and French are mandatory foreign languages in both private and public schools, although the quality of foreign languages teaching is poor. Some private educational institutes provide teaching in other languages, notably Italian, Japanese and Mandarin.Haitian Creole is the largest minority language in the Dominican Republic and is spoken by Haitian immigrants and their descendants. There is a community of a few thousand people whose ancestors spoke Saman\u00e1 English in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly enslaved African Americans who arrived in the nineteenth century, but only a few elders speak the language today. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country's economic ties with the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English. The Dominican Republic is ranked 2nd in Latin America and 23rd in the World on English proficiency.\n\n\n=== Population centres ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n95.0%  Christians 2.6%  No religion 2.2%  Other religions As of 2014, 57% of the population (5.7 million) identified themselves as Roman Catholics and 23% (2.3 million) as Protestants (in Latin American countries, Protestants are often called Evangelicos because they emphasize personal and public evangelising and many are Evangelical Protestant or of a Pentecostal group). From 1896 to 1907 missionaries from the Episcopal, Free Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist and Moravians churches began work in the Dominican Republic. Three percent of the 10.63 million Dominican Republic population are Seventh-day Adventists. Recent immigration as well as proselytizing efforts have brought in other religious groups, with the following shares of the population: Spiritist: 2.2%, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 1.3%, Buddhist: 0.1%, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed: 0.1%, Chinese Folk Religion: 0.1%, Islam: 0.02%, Judaism: 0.01%.\nThe Catholic Church began to lose its strong dominance in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, priests, and support programs. During the same time, Protestant Evangelicalism began to gain a wider support \"with their emphasis on personal responsibility and family rejuvenation, economic entrepreneurship, and biblical fundamentalism\". The Dominican Republic has two Catholic patroness saints: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Altagracia (Our Lady Of High Grace) and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes (Our Lady Of Mercy).\nThe Dominican Republic has historically granted extensive religious freedom. According to the United States Department of State, \"The constitution specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Vatican designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties.\" In the 1950s restrictions were placed upon churches by the government of Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the Catholic Church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was put into place, with his assassination.\nDuring World War II a group of Jews escaping Nazi Germany fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of Sos\u00faa. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.\n\n\n=== 20th century immigration ===\n\nIn the 20th century, many Arabs (from Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine), Japanese, and, to a lesser degree, Koreans settled in the country as agricultural laborers and merchants. The Chinese companies found business in telecom, mining, and railroads. The Arab community is rising at an increasing rate and is estimated at 80,000.In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, St. Vincent, Montserrat, Tortola, St. Croix, St. Thomas, and Guadeloupe. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds and Puerto Plata. Puerto Rican, and to a lesser extent, Cuban immigrants fled to the Dominican Republic from the mid-1800s until about 1940 due to a poor economy and social unrest in their respective home countries. Many Puerto Rican immigrants settled in Hig\u00fcey, among other cities, and quickly assimilated due to similar culture. Before and during World War II, 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican Republic.Numerous immigrants have come from other Caribbean countries, as the country has offered economic opportunities. There is an increasing number of Puerto Rican immigrants, especially in and around Santo Domingo; they are believed to number around 10,000. There are over 700,000 people of Haitian descent, including a generation born in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n==== Haitian immigration ====\n\nHaiti is the neighboring nation to the Dominican Republic and is considerably poorer, less developed and is additionally the least developed country in the western hemisphere. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% living in abject poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people also has a fast growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force lack formal jobs. Haiti's per capita GDP (PPP) was $1,800 in 2017, or just over one-tenth of the Dominican figure.As a result, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, with some estimates of 800,000 Haitians in the country, while others put the Haitian-born population as high as one million. They usually work at low-paying and unskilled jobs in building construction and house cleaning and in sugar plantations. There have been accusations that some Haitian immigrants work in slavery-like conditions and are severely exploited.Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.Haiti also suffers from severe environmental degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti's forests remain, and in many places the soil has eroded right down to the bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, some Haitian bootleggers have created an illegal market for charcoal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.In 2005, Dominican President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez criticized collective expulsions of Haitians as having taken place \"in an abusive and inhuman way.\" After a UN delegation issued a preliminary report stating that it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against people of Haitian origin, Dominican Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso issued a formal statement denouncing it, asserting that \"our border with Haiti has its problems[;] this is our reality and it must be understood. It is important not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not to confuse security with xenophobia.\"The children of Haitian immigrants are eligible for Haitian nationality, are denied it by Haiti because of a lack of proper documents or witnesses.\n\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nThe first of three late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo, due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general. In 1965, the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas. From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals.In the early 1980s, underemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to a third wave of emigration from the Dominican Republic. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high. In 2012, there were approximately 1.7 million people of Dominican descent in the U.S., counting both native- and foreign-born. There was also a growing Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico, with nearly 70,000 Dominicans living there as of 2010. Although that number is slowly decreasing and immigration trends have reversed because of Puerto Rico's economic crisis as of 2016.\nThere is a significant Dominican population in Spain.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nIn 2020, the Dominican Republic had an estimated birth rate of 18.5 per 1000 and a death rate of 6.3 per 1000.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary education is regulated by the Ministry of Education, with education being a right of all citizens and youth in the Dominican Republic.Preschool education is organized in different cycles and serves the 2\u20134 age group and the 4\u20136 age group. Preschool education is not mandatory except for the last year. Basic education is compulsory and serves the population of the 6\u201314 age group. Secondary education is not compulsory, although it is the duty of the state to offer it for free. It caters to the 14\u201318 age group and is organized in a common core of four years and three modes of two years of study that are offered in three different options: general or academic, vocational (industrial, agricultural, and services), and artistic.\nThe higher education system consists of institutes and universities. The institutes offer courses of a higher technical level. The universities offer technical careers, undergraduate and graduate; these are regulated by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nIn 2012, the Dominican Republic had a murder rate of 22.1 per 100,000 population. There was a total of 2,268 murders in the Dominican Republic in 2012.The Dominican Republic has become a trans-shipment point for Colombian drugs destined for Europe as well as the United States and Canada. Money-laundering via the Dominican Republic is favored by Colombian drug cartels for the ease of illicit financial transactions. In 2004, it was estimated that 8% of all cocaine smuggled into the United States had come through the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic responded with increased efforts to seize drug shipments, arrest and extradite those involved, and combat money-laundering.\nThe often light treatment of violent criminals has been a continuous source of local controversy. In April 2010, five teenagers, aged 15 to 17, shot and killed two taxi drivers and killed another five by forcing them to drink drain-cleaning acid. On September 24, 2010, the teens were sentenced to prison terms of three to five years, despite the protests of the taxi drivers' families.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDue to cultural syncretism, the culture and customs of the Dominican people have a European cultural basis, influenced by both African and native Ta\u00edno elements, although endogenous elements have emerged within Dominican culture; culturally the Dominican Republic is among the most-European countries in Spanish America, alongside Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. Spanish institutions in the colonial era were able to predominate in the Dominican culture's making-of as a relative success in the acculturation and cultural assimilation of African slaves diminished African cultural influence in comparison to other Caribbean countries.\nMusic and sport are of great importance in the Dominican culture, with Merengue and Bachata as the national dance and music, and baseball as the favorite sport.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nDominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of fine art that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between neoclassicism and romanticism. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of realism and impressionism. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe 20th century brought many prominent Dominican writers, and saw a general increase in the perception of Dominican literature.  Writers such as Juan Bosch (one of the greatest storytellers in Latin America), Pedro Mir (national poet of the Dominican Republic), Aida Cartagena Portalatin (poetess par excellence who spoke in the Era of Rafael Trujillo), Emilio Rodr\u00edguez Demorizi (the most important Dominican historian, with more than 1000 written works), Manuel del Cabral (main Dominican poet featured in black poetry), Hector Inchustegui Cabral (considered one of the most prominent voices of the Caribbean social poetry of the twentieth century), Miguel Alfonseca (poet belonging to Generation 60), Rene del Risco (acclaimed poet who was a participant in the June 14 Movement), Mateo Morrison (excellent poet and writer with numerous awards), among many more prolific authors, put the island in one of the most important in Literature in the twentieth century. \nNew 21st century Dominican writers have not yet achieved the renown of their 20th century counterparts. However, writers such as Frank B\u00e1ez (won the 2006 Santo Domingo Book Fair First Prize), Junot D\u00edaz (2008 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) and Emil Cerda (won the Premio Joven Destacado Award 2019 for his novel M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo espiritual Vol. 1), lead Dominican literature in the 21st century.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the European colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and baroque structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of Santo Domingo, which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the Americas, located in the city's Colonial Zone, an area declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The Ta\u00edno people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Ta\u00edno hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly Spanish, Ta\u00edno, and African. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and mang\u00fa (mashed, boiled plantain). Heartier versions of mang\u00fa are accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically), cheese, or both. Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and salad. \"La Bandera\" (literally \"The Flag\") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. Sancocho is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.\n\nMeals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with sofrito, which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and saut\u00e9ed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes or tipili (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include chicharr\u00f3n, yuca, casabe, pastelitos (empanadas), batata, yam, pasteles en hoja, chimichurris, and tostones.\nSome treats Dominicans enjoy are arroz con leche (or arroz con dulce), bizcocho dominicano (lit. Dominican cake), habichuelas con dulce, flan, fr\u00edo fr\u00edo (snow cones), dulce de leche, and ca\u00f1a (sugarcane). The beverages Dominicans enjoy are Morir So\u00f1ando, rum, beer, Mama Juana, batida (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), mab\u00ed, coffee, and chaca (also called maiz caqueao/casqueado, maiz con dulce and maiz con leche), the last item being found only in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n\nMusically, the Dominican Republic is known for the world popular musical style and genre called merengue, a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the tambora and g\u00fcira.\nIts syncopated beats use Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are Wilfrido Vargas, Johnny Ventura, singer-songwriter Los Hermanos Rosario, Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, To\u00f1o Rosario, Milly Quezada, and Chich\u00ed Peralta.\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 1990s, when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of bachata, along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.Bachata, a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was amargue (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term bachata became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called bolero. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\nPalo is an Afro-Dominican sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the Congo region of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.Salsa music has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like Johnny Pacheco, creator of the Fania All Stars, played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\nDominican rock and Reggaeton are also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Dise\u00f1o de Altos de Chav\u00f3n, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design. Noted fashion designer Oscar de la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga and then worked with the house of Lanvin in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles. Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America, where it became very popular, and remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n. De la Renta died of complications from cancer on October 20, 2014.\n\n\n=== National symbols ===\n\nSome of the Dominican Republic's important symbols are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem, titled Himno Nacional. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (meaning \"Dominican Republic\"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.\nThe national flower is the Bayahibe Rose and the national tree is the West Indian Mahogany. The national bird is the Cigua Palmera or Palmchat (\"Dulus dominicus\").The Dominican Republic celebrates Dia de la Altagracia on January 21 in honor of its patroness, Duarte's Day on January 26 in honor of one of its founding fathers, Independence Day on February 27, Restoration Day on August 16, Virgen de las Mercedes on September 24, and Constitution Day on November 6.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBaseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. The country has a baseball league of six teams. Its season usually begins in October and ends in January. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second highest number of Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Ozzie Virgil Sr. became the first Dominican-born player in the MLB on September 23, 1956. Juan Marichal, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, and Vladimir Guerrero are the only Dominican-born players in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Other notable baseball players born in the Dominican Republic are Jos\u00e9 Bautista, Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9, George Bell, Robinson Can\u00f3, Rico Carty, Bartolo Col\u00f3n, Nelson Cruz, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez, Francisco Liriano, David Ortiz, Pl\u00e1cido Polanco, Albert Pujols, Hanley Ram\u00edrez, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Jos\u00e9 Reyes, Sammy Sosa, and Miguel Tejada. Felipe Alou has also enjoyed success as a manager and Omar Minaya as a general manager. In 2013, the Dominican team went undefeated en route to winning the World Baseball Classic.\nIn boxing, the country has produced scores of world-class fighters and several world champions, such as Carlos Cruz, his brother Leo, Juan Guzman, and Joan Guzman.

          "The Pantheon is important not only for the Domicans but for the Puertorricans since this is the final resting place for Eugenio Maria de Hostos. It is an important stop in the colonial zone walking tour. There is usually an honor guard and a volunteer guide that will answer all",

          "This is a very nice building that hosts the remains of some of the heroes of this country. It is guarded by a soldier in uniform all the time and it is a very nice place to visit. It has one secret that even some Dominican's don't know about. Up high towards both sides. There",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future.

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

        "wiki": "The Dominican Civil War (Spanish: Guerra Civil Dominicana) took place between April 24, 1965, and September 3, 1965, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. It started when civilian and military supporters of former President Juan Bosch overthrew acting President Donald Reid Cabral. The coup prompted General El\u00edas Wessin y Wessin to organize elements of the military loyal to President Reid (\"loyalists\"), initiating an armed campaign against the so-called constitutionalist rebels. Allegations of foreign support for the rebels led to a United States intervention in the conflict, which later transformed into an Organization of American States occupation of the country. Elections were held in 1966, in the aftermath of which Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer was elected into the presidential seat. Later in the same year international troops departed from the country.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn November 19, 1911, General Luis Tejera led a group of conspirators in an ambush on the horsedrawn carriage of Dominican President Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres. During the shootout, C\u00e1ceres was killed and Tejera wounded in the leg. In the ensuing power vacuum, General Alfredo Victoria, the commander of the army, seized control and forced the Dominican Congress to elect his uncle, Eladio Victoria, as the new president. The general was widely suspected of bribing the Congress, and his uncle, who took office on February 27, 1912, lacked legitimacy. The former president Horacio V\u00e1squez soon returned from exile to lead his followers, the horacistas, in a popular uprising against the new government.The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. US mediation by the William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson administrations achieved only short respites each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling Dominicans that unless they chose a president, they would see the United States impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later that year, relatively-free elections returned the former President (1899\u20131902) Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra to power. To achieve a government that was more broadly supported, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. However, that brought no peace and, with his former Secretary of War Desiderio Arias maneuvering to depose him and despite a US offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.Wilson thus ordered the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic. The US Marines landed on May 16, 1916 and controlled the country two months later. The US military government, led by Rear Admiral Harry Shepard Knapp, was widely repudiated by Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against the US forces. The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that finally connected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I, it increased in the US as well, where President Warren G. Harding (1921\u201323), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised during his electoral campaign. The US occupation ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.\nThe victor was the former President (1902\u201303) Horacio V\u00e1squez Lajara, who had co-operated with the United States. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924, and the last US forces left in September. V\u00e1squez gave the country six years of stable governance in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly in a relatively-peaceful atmosphere.A rebellion or coup d'\u00e9tat against him broke out in February 1930 in Santiago. Rafael Trujillo secretly cut a deal with the rebel leader Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a. In return for Trujillo letting Estrella take power, Estrella would allow Trujillo to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, which allowed Estrella's rebels to take the capital virtually unopposed. On March 3, Estrella was proclaimed acting president, with Trujillo confirmed as the head of the police and of the army. As per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly-formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Estrella as his running mate. The other candidates became targets of harassment by the army and withdrew when it became apparent that Trujillo would be the only person who would be allowed to campaign effectively. Ultimately, the Trujillo-Estrella ticket was proclaimed victorious with an implausible 99% of the vote. According to the US ambassador, Trujillo received more votes than there were actual voters.On May 30, 1961, Trujillo was shot and killed when his blue 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air was ambushed on a road outside the Dominican capital. He was the victim of an ambush plotted by a number of men, such as General Juan Tom\u00e1s D\u00edaz, Antonio de la Maza, Amado Garc\u00eda Guerrero, and General Antonio Imbert Barrera.The country came under the rule of a military junta until 1963, when democratic elections were organized with US aid. Juan Emilio Bosch Gavi\u00f1o emerged victorious in the elections, assuming office. Bosch then tried to implement a number of social democratic reforms, which caused the anger of the clergy, business magnates and members of the army, who initiated a rumor campaign that accused Bosch of being a communist. On September 25, 1963, a group of 25 senior military commanders, led by El\u00edas Wessin y Wessin, expelled Bosch from the country and installed Donald Reid Cabral as the new president. Reid failed to gather popular support, and several factions prepared to launch a coup, such as Constitutionalists under Bosch, a group in the Dominican army under Pe\u00f1a Taveras, supporters of the former Dominican Revolutionary Party leader Nicol\u00e1s Silfa and plotters siding with Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer.\n\n\n== Civil war ==\n\n\n=== April Revolution ===\n\nOn April 24, 1965, three junior officers requested a meeting with President Donald Reid Cabral, who revoked the commission after he had received news of a suspected anti-government plot. When Chief of Staff Riviera Cuesta was instead sent to discuss with the officers at the August 16 military camp, he was immediately detained. A group of military constitutionalists and Dominican Revolutionary Party (DRP) supporters then seized the Radio Santo Domingo building and issued calls of sedition while Constitutionalist officers distributed weapons and Molotov cocktails to their civilian comrades. The transmissions prompted the garrison of the February 27 camp and a unit of the Dominican Navy's frogmen to defect. Large numbers of police officers abandoned their positions and changed into civilian clothing.The following day, Reid appointed General Wessin y Wessin as the new chief of staff. Wessin rallied the government troops, branded them Loyalists, and announced his plans of suppressing the rebellion. At 10:30 am rebels stormed the presidential palace and arrested Reid. Several hours later, four Loyalist P-51 Mustangs conducted aerial bombings of the National Palace and other Constitutionalist positions, and one plane was shot down during the incident. A single Loyalist vessel, Mella, on the river Ozama, also bombarded the palace. Fearing that a mob, which had gathered at the palace, would lynch Reid, the rebel commander Francisco Caama\u00f1o allowed him to escape, as Reid had already lost the support of the Loyalists. The majority of the DRP leadership fled the capital, and Constitutionalists mobilized a total of 5,000 armed civilians and 1,500 members of the military. On April 26, Jos\u00e9 Rafael Molina Ure\u00f1a was declared the provisional president, and large crowds gathered in the streets to demand Bosch's return from exile.\n\n\n=== US intervention ===\nIn the meantime, US diplomats in Santo Domingo initiated preparations for evacuating 3,500 U.S citizens. In the early morning of April 27, 1,176 foreign civilians who had assembled in Hotel Embajador were airlifted to the Bajos de Haina naval facility, where they boarded USS Ruchamkin and USS Wood County, as well as the helicopters of HMM-264, which evacuated them from the island to USS Boxer and USS Raleigh. Later that day, 1,500 Loyalist troops, supported by armored cars and tanks, marched from the San Isidro Air Base, captured Duarte Bridge, and took position on the west bank of the Ozama River. A second force, consisting of 700 soldiers, left San Crist\u00f3bal and attacked the western suburbs of Santo Domingo. Rebels overran the Fortaleza Ozama police headquarters and took 700 prisoners. On April 28, armed civilians attacked the Villa Consuelo police station and executed all of the police officers who survived the initial skirmish. One US Marine battalion landed in Haina and later moved to Hotel Embajador, where it provided assistance in the upcoming airlifts. During the night, 684 civilians were airlifted to USS Boxer. One US Marine was killed by a rebel sniper during the operation.On April 29, the US ambassador to the Dominican Republic, William Tapley Bennett, who had sent numerous reports to US President Lyndon Johnson, reported that the situation had reached life-threatening proportions for US citizens and that the rebels received foreign support. Bennett stressed that the US had to act immediately, as the creation of an international coalition would be time-consuming. Contrary to the suggestions of his advisers, Johnson authorized the transformation of evacuation operations into a large-scale military intervention through Operation Power Pack, which was aimed to prevent the development of what he saw as a second Cuban Revolution. It was the first U.S. military intervention in Latin America in more than 30 years.\n\nAt 2:16 a.m. on April 30, 1965, the 3rd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division landed at the San Isidro Air Base and started the US military intervention in the conflict. During the next couple of hours, two brigade combat teams and heavy equipment were also dispatched. At sunrise the 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment moved up the San Isidoro highway, securing a position east of the Duarte bridge. The 1st Battalion 505th Infantry Regiment remained at the airbase and sent out patrols to the perimeter. A force of 1,700 Marines of the 6th Marine Expeditionary Unit occupied an area containing a number of foreign embassies. The locale was proclaimed an International Security Zone by the Organization of American States (OAS). Earlier in the day, the OAS also issued a resolution calling the combatants to end all hostilities. At 4:30 p.m., representatives of the loyalists, the rebels, and the US military signed a ceasefire that was to take effect at 11:45 p.m. That timing favored the demoralized Loyalists, who had lost control of Ciudad Colonial.On 5 May, the OAS Peace Committee arrived in Santo Domingo, and a second definite ceasefire agreement was signed, which ended the main phase of the civil war. Under the Act of Santo Domingo, the OAS was tasked with overseeing the implementation of the peace deal as well as distributing food and medication through the capital. The treaties failed to prevent some violations such as small-scale firefights and sniper fire. A day later, OAS members established the Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) with the goal of serving as a peacekeeping formation in the Dominican Republic. The IAPF had 1,748 Brazilian, Paraguayan, Nicaraguan, Costa Rican, Salvadoran and Honduran troops and was headed by Brazilian General Hugo Panasco Alvim, with US Army General Bruce Palmer serving as his deputy commander.\n\n\n=== US withdrawal ===\nOn 26 May, US forces began gradually withdrawing from the island. On June 15, the Constitutionalists launched a second and final attempt to expand the boundaries of their stronghold. In the bloodiest battle of the intervention, the rebels began their attack on US outposts. Using the greatest firepower yet, they used tear gas grenades, .50-caliber machine guns, 20 mm guns, mortars, rocket launchers, and tank fire. The 1st battalions of the 505th and 508th Infantry quickly went on the offensive. Two days of fighting cost the US five KIA and 31 WIA. The OAS forces, consisting of a large number of Brazilians and whose orders were to remain at their defenses, counted five wounded. The Constitutionalists claimed 67 dead and 165 injured.\nThe first postwar elections were held on July 1, 1966 and pit the Reformist Party candidate, Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, against the former president Juan Emilio Bosch Gavi\u00f1o. Balaguer emerged victorious in the elections after he built his campaign on promises of reconciliation. On September 21, 1966, the last OAS peacekeepers withdrew from the island, which ended the foreign intervention in the conflict.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of the Dominican Republic\nUnited States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)\nBay of Pigs Invasion\nJohnson Doctrine\nUnited States involvement in regime change\nLatin America\u2013United States relations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLyndon Johnson - On the Situation in the Dominican Republic\nDominican Republic PSYOP\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-17A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-18A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-19A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-20A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-22A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-25A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-27A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Staff Film Report 66-28A (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nThe short film Marines 65 (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive",

          "The Memorial Museum of the Dominican Resistance is also known as a museum of political repression. The exhibits are contained in a two story building on Calle Arzobispo Nouel, which is a short walk east of Independence Square. The admission fee is RD$150, and is very reasonable",
          "This small museum is loaded with information about the horrific Era de Trujillo. It has the most complete compilation of a shameful era in our history. The visit would take about two hours.",
          "In respect to the Dominican History, I felt we had to visit this museum. It is a modern done tour with audio in a ACed building. For all the communications printed you have to be spanish speaking. I didn't have the english spoken audio tour, perhaps that helps well to explains",
          "The last time I went was taking a friend to watch historical memoirs at Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana was in January 2019, but I have this Museum very close to my heart !. My father was one of the heroes during the times of tyranny off TRUJILLO and militant of 1J4",
          "This museum is very recent. Depicting the martyrs and heroes, sometimes unknown ones that fought against some of the recent Dominican regimens. Pictures, text and videos along with original objects make you feel a touch of a bitter taste. Recommended for the whole family.",
          "This is a neat place to get educated on the resistance. I enjoyed visiting and seeing the sites associated with the memorial.",
          "Very good depiction of modern Dominican history during the time of the Trujillo dictator. In the Colonial Zone.",
          "Very nice but small museum. Quite helpful to understand recent Dominican history. Good guide to help you understand how Dominican resistance went through the age.",
          "Very interesting and extremely important exhibits. Knowledge of Spanish is helpful but not essential.",
          "I learned a ton during my visit. The audio guide was informative, and the photos were, too. As others have mentioned, there is just way too much text to get through. This shouldn't discourage you from visiting the museum-- just know that you probably won't get to it all. I was",
          "There are quite many attractions in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone that are under-visited but infinitely more worthwhile to visit than El Conde - and this Museum of Resistance is one of those places. The subject matter is a narrowly focused one, and one can tell the curators put",
          "While well presented, and with excellent audio tour included in the ticket, this is just a bit too much for the usual tourist to absorb or appreciate.",
          "Weird displays but interesting if you take tour The animatronics are the highlight No lines, not free but cheap, and easy to find",
          "To be honest, the layout here is average and there's not a lot of successful creativity in the presentation. That being said, the history is so important and so gripping that the museum definitely merits a visit. It's inexpensive and you can get a lot from it in an hour, though",
          "This is a museum made by passionate people, about an hour of visit with intense immersion inside the dominican history. Something efficient to understand better this country.",
          "We accidentally stumbled on this museum while walking from our apartment to the Colonial Zone. Probably the most professionally done and in the best shape of all the museums in Santo Domingo - clean, all the lights work, air conditioned, good audio narrative, etc. Perhaps it",
          "I'm pleased I can't read Spanish as there was so much written information, it would have taken me a week to get around. As it was, with the audio tour (included in the entry price) I was able to hear the salient points and enjoy most of the museum. I knew very little of DR's",
          "to understand a very important chapter of the dominican history that still today defines the local culture, this is a must.",
          "Although much of this museum is written and photographic material and is mainly in Spanish there is enough translated to make it understandable to English speakers. It is very revealing about what went on in the Trujillo regime, backed by the Americans and the Catholic Church,",
          "Very historical and educative for people of all ages. I definitely recommend for tourist and also locals to visit this museum.",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports. Aeropuerto Internacional La Isabela a newly constructed airport located in the northern section of the city, within kilometres of the city center. It serves mostly domestic and charter flights. The major international airport that serves the city is Santo Domingo Las Americas, which serves North, Central and South America and also Europe.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Santo Domingo is located on the Ozama River. Its location at the center of the Caribbean is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\nThe port's renovation is part of a major redevelopment project, aimed at integrating the port area and the Zona Colonial and foster a cruise, yacht, and high-end tourism destination. Supported by legislation approved in 2005, the project, developed by the Sans Souci Group, also includes the development of a new sports marina and a 122-acre (0.49 km2) mixed-leisure real estate development adjacent to the port.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\nSanto Domingo is the terminus for four of the five national highways.

When he was seven, his family moved to Montevideo (Uruguay) but returned to Barcelona in 1910. In 1916, he entered the School of Industrial Engineers of Barcelona; he did not graduate as he started to work as an assistant for the Exhibition of Electrical Industries of Barcelona. Later he continued to study at the \u00c9cole de Civil G\u00e9nie of Paris.\nIn 1922 Bu\u00efgas designed his first project with illuminated water fountains for the Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Eugeni d'Ors described his work as a new style of art, the art of agualuz. His most famous work is the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, created for the International Exposition in Barcelona in 1929.During the Spanish Civil War he settled in Paris, where he resided until 1942. During these years he gained international reputation and he obtained commissions for projects for international expositions in Paris (1937), Liege (1939), Lisbon (1940), Rome (1953), and the Expo 58 at Brussels. In 1955, he designed the Teatro del Aqua y Luz for the international fair in Santo Domingo.

          "At the Sambil Mall, Aquamundo is a wonderful and interesting aquarium. We were greeted and enjoyed the walkthrough. As we explored and learned about the sea world, the experience was relaxing and affordable. As you complete the walkthrough, there is a cafe. Overall, this",

          "The place itself is small but some fish tanks are ridiculously small for the poor fish in there, even smaller than in a pet shop. It is heartbreaking for the animals (fishes but also, squirrels, turtles, snakes...) . The decorations/ set up is nice and the water tunnel a nice",
          "We visited the Sambil during our vacations. They have a lot of fun for the family. Our children enjoyed the Aquarium, Krispy Kreme store, rhe toy store, the food court and the laser runners. My wife enjoyed the shopping. Everything was nice, clean and secure, but the restrooms",
          "Its a very small aquarium inside of Sambil mall. They have an open area where you can pet starfish. Maybe a little overpriced due to its size. The walk through area of the aquarium takes literally 5 seconds to walk through. It looks much larger in the photos but its still worth",
          "Hello, To celebrate the birthday of the little ones is an excellent place, we decided to do the little mermaid. The aquarium has a salon for activities and includes a tour of the aquarium with a character, the captain. The aquarium is not big but the kids enjoy playing the rays",
          "The place is pretty small. I wouldn't come to this location solely for the aquarium, but if you're already staying nearby with small children and also want to see a movie and eat at a food court, then this place could work.",
          "A decent acquarium for DR standards. At the end you can hold the small snakes and feed the fish, which kids seem to enjoy",
          "Went here some months back, not planning to go ever again, saw many instances of very horrible conditions in which the fish are kept. In one tank there were dead fish at the bottom of the tank, on another they had one that was missing an eye, and you could clearly see the",
          "The aquarium is inside Sambil mall, so it could be a rainy, sunny, windy, or hot day and doesn't matter. Took nephew there. He was excited about the tunnel but after few seconds he noticed how short the tunnel was and wanted more...the best thing to see and do there is buying",
          "i got the full package and loved the fish, it was new and in good condition. much better than visiting the national aquarium. get your picture and have a good time.",

          "I had a great time. It was very pretty and I even got to hold a starfish! It isn't that expensive either, compared to the aquariums here in the US. However, the aquarium, Acuario Nacional, is a fraction of the cost, but it is mainly outside so there is no air conditioning like",
          "The rooms and tanks are very nice and modern, they could have been part of any US aquarium. Ask for the group rate - we did very well. At least we didn't have to contend with the school groups at the National Aquarium.",
          "This is a nice aquarium for the kids, if you are visiting Sambil Mall. It is a bit expensive for what is offered, and some containers are too small for the animals. There is a pool with star fish that you and the children can touch after thoroughly washing your hands! Be warned,",
          "Well maintained and the staff is very enthusiastic and ready to share their knowledge and interesting facts (at least in Spanish, not sure if in English it will be the same, but I really didn't try).",

          "This was a nice place to visit but was very limited on what they had on display. Nice views of the ocean and park for the kids to play in. Again, beware of the two different prices for residents and the outrageous price for tourist who help boost their economy.",
          "We went with the kids and they really enjoyed it. They were able to touch the starfish and run around. There's lights, there's colours. Nice for kids, but really not something that you'll spend more than half an hour to see it all. And quite pricy.",
          "very nice aquarium inside a mall, the tour guide was awesome...then on to exploring until we got to carry some starfish...which are only allowed 20 min out of water. Afer going through the mazes I got kinda dizzy...but in a good way because it was all worth it. Great for",

          "For beeing in a mall it's quite amazing. It has quite an amount of different species, some of which are really interesting. My sun loved to feed the fish at the end of the tour with this tiny baby bottle. There are also some native animals like snakes and spiders. We appreciated",
          "I took a child I sponsor here and she really enjoyed it, especially the fun pictures they'll take of your group; however, it is really small and unimpressive compared to the aquariums I'm used to at home. I will say that the staff is fantastic and walked us around to make sure",
          "So if you are looking for things to do with small kids than you could do worse than this small aquarium. However, keep your expectations low (that includes how much time you think it will take, you can kill an hour here tops, and I mean TOPS) as this place is pretty small, the",
          "For it to be so high in the rakning of things to do in Santo Domingo, this is way overrated. It does have a tunnel which is why I went for, but the truth is I was expecting more. I would recommend it for people with small children if it's a rainy day and you can't really go",
          "I went because I was invited to a babyshower. I didn\u00b4t like that they did not offered a full tour. It was nice but If I had to paid it was not worth it.",
          "We weren't expecting much, but the trip here was pretty fun! The aquarium is well laid out and we enjoyed looking at all the different exhibits. The one downfall was that all the info signs were only in Spanish, no English. But the staff were great and tried to help us out.",
          "The Aquamundo is very nice and educative, in this place the person can see some special fish, the people can gonna be to shopping, bacauce this is a very good please, for example tecnology, or dresses and have meny stores for food",

          "This place is small but kept up nicely. I recommend visiting during day time during the week. It was so not crouded when we went and I really like not competing to get a view of all the tanks. We were able to be relaxed and take our time. There is a large collection of",
          "Decided to come here and can say that this is the nicest aquarium the city has in comparison to \"El Aquario Nacional\". The Aquarium itself is not that big and all the exhibits are on one floor. This is more or less a spot you can bring the kids to for a short period, not a",
          "We went to the Sambil mall for this attraction. Maybe my hopes were up too high because of the reviews but the aquarium was rather small; however, they did have some amphibious creatures that amazed me. The price is 350pesos per person and the tour last all of 6minutes if",
          "Loved this place. it is inside Sambil Mall which is a good place to go anyways for coffee, the movies or to eat. The aquarium has relatively a lot of species, and a cute sunken boat tunnel which was lots of fun to see.",
          "Now who ever heard of a walk through aquarium in the middle of a magnificently designed mall? This is ideal for the entire family. It is fun, entertaining and exciting. Everyone will be talking about this for months to come. Ideal for field trips by schools or organizations as",
          "They have a new aquarium, is not the best or bigger one ever but for the city is the first. Is very overprized so unless you haven\u2019t gone to bigger of more beautiful ones, don\u2019t go there since you will get disappointed. But go upstairs to the food court since it is big and have",
          "We went to the Sambil Aquamundo last Sunday. Not the best aquarium I have ever seen by far, but pretty cool for the Dominican Republic, where many attractions are very old, poorly conceived and built and most of the time bad maintained. Brand new, clean and interesting. It lacks",

          "first of its kind in Santo Domingo. Huge brand new mall. No American clothing stores. Something different then what we are use too.",

          "This small aquarium have very impresive creature, specially a great diversity of the coral reef tropical fish, and strange creature. Have some small shark, obvious for reason of the space. And have another land creature, like Iguana, cocodrille, the show our fauna. Is a 40",

          "it was a good visit. Interesting for our kid. We also went shopping after the visit. I think it is the main purpose they constructed Aquamundo in the big shopping mall.",
          "Small aquarium located inside the Sambil. It was enough to keep my kids occupied the entire time which was great because it was raining like crazy here and we were unable to go to the beach. Lots of first-run movies at a seemingly \"US\" style theater. Great place to visit if",
          "It is a nice place to visit if you wan to see some fishes, this is a nice place to see them. Is not a huge aquariaum, but a small and privately owned aquarium tucked into the back of a shopping mall of Sambil. A lovely place to visit with family.",
          "As DR is an island surrounded by the sea, a visitor would logically want to see some fish. So, off we went to Aquamundo. This is NOT some gigantissmo Florida-style theme park. It is a small, privately-owned aquarium tucked into the back of a shopping mall. Depending on the",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012.

          "This beautiful cathedral, the earliest built in the Americas, still maintains a quiet, peaceful aura to it despite its tourist attractiveness, and is a lovely spot to both admire the architecture and to sit for a few minutes amidst the bustle of the area. There's a statue of",

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports.

The major international airport that serves the city is Santo Domingo Las Americas, which serves North, Central and South America and also Europe.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Santo Domingo is located on the Ozama River. Its location at the center of the Caribbean is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\nThe port's renovation is part of a major redevelopment project, aimed at integrating the port area and the Zona Colonial and foster a cruise, yacht, and high-end tourism destination. Supported by legislation approved in 2005, the project, developed by the Sans Souci Group, also includes the development of a new sports marina and a 122-acre (0.49 km2) mixed-leisure real estate development adjacent to the port.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\nSanto Domingo is the terminus for four of the five national highways.

          "If you are in SD a quick trip to Malecon is worth it. Stay at the busty end where there is a lot of action restaurants hotels to get the vibe",
          "The Malecon is overrated, not a place you can walk at night even during the day there are a heavy police presence. There are areas where you can not even see the beach due to the huge amount of litter on the local beach, wave after wave full of plastic bottles rolling in towards",
          "A very nice place to walk around and enjoy the weather. During the night the place changes with locals having a very good time. Swing by and have fun!",
          "Sad to see a place that should be gorgeous just left to rot. Too dangerous to visit at night, garbage piling up on shore. I LOVE Santo Domingo and love the DR, but this was unfortunate.",
          "It is very nice to walk, around the big international hotels (like Sheraton, Catalonia, Jaragua) because it is safe. But if you look down to the shore, you will see all kind of trash, rats, old abandon clothes and shoes, disgusting, People does not care and city authorities",
          "many eateries, good food lots of bars and right by the ocean. ADRIAN TROPICAL is a restaurant on this street, highly recommend it.",
          "Malecon nice place to go in the day & night. Malecon is in the most centrist parts of Santo Domingo. there is a small beach, you can sit chill with your friends",
          "The Malecon was where we would end our days during our visit to Santo Domingo. We had a family of 5 with kids from the teens to 6 years old. This is a great people watching spot and a chance to soak up the culture of Santo Domingo. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and",
          "It\u2019s a long walk and it really depends which part of this you\u2019re on. We walked down from Calle Hostos in Zona Colonial area and it takes a while just to cross the main road as there\u2019s no priority crossing for pedestrians, the traffic comes flying round a corner so be careful.",
          "I was expecting a wide promenade such as the malecon in Mazatlan. This was a narrow sidewalk on a cliff overlooking warehouses and cliffs. We walked down to this malecon from the Colonial Zone. The traffic was very heavy, so crossing to the ocean side of the street was",
          "Don\u2019t even bother. It\u2019s noisy, dirty, litter everywhere: the ocean, the trees at the shore, the docks, the sidewalks, uff. There is absolutely nothing to see. Abandon buildings, some hotels and casinos that are not worthy and the traffic is insane, so if you decide to walk, you",
          "A boulevard and promenade on the beach with palm trees, the boulevard is one of the seven cultural treasures of Santo Domingo.",
          "We walked through the coast to get to the Malecon and to our deception, it was all trash and trash smell, rotten smell. Then it was a little better but still very polluted...What a shame.",
          "This is a must see for tourist. It is a long stretch but it has keys spots. Depending on the time of the day you can have different type of fun. It can be a romantic, child friendly and an all out music and drink place. I recommend it.",
          "Not going to The Malec\u00f3n in Cuba is like going to Disney and not seeing Mickey Mouse. This a historical place. Very relaxing and with a beautiful sight. Bring water for hydration and sunscreen to enjoy a long and safe walk.",
          "Nice walk along the Santo Domingo Ocean Front. Only thing is there was a lot of garbage, plastic bottles along the beachfront washed up from the ocean.",
          "A lovely view for sure. I imagine many more people frequented this spot many years ago but now tourists rather gather at the Colonial zone. It seemed like it could be a little bit unsafe.",
          "George Washington avenue is the biggest attraction to walk, jog and run next to the Caribbean sea. Few kilometers of newly remodeled walking sideways. Always has company with you. However if you are a runner go for few miles is sideseen and cold winds in the early morning. It",
          "Great view but surrounded by lots of locals. Made me feel a little bit unsafe. We just went took pictures looked around for a little bit and that's it went back to our car which they do have a few thins to park your car.",
          "Great walk along the coast line, restaurants and other attractions along the malecon. Traffic can be bad during rush hour, but you can stop off at several casinos that line the malecon.",
          "It was recommended to me to visit the Malec\u00f3n while I was staying in Santo Domingo. While the views were very pretty, you could see them from the car and I do not recommend walking around a lot. I was traveling by myself for work, so I was walking around the Malec\u00f3n alone in the",
          "The Malecon is a long avenue that runs parallel to the ocean and the avenida George Washington. Enjoy a stroll and the ocean breeze (early morning or early evening is best) as have many families through the years.",
          "Becuse officials are so concentrated on robbing from it's citizens they don't pay attention to the Malecon. It is completely different now. It is abandoned ghetto and ugly. How can a tourist walk to it from the Colonial Zone? Impossible. So sad.",
          "If you are in Santo Domingo, just pass by to see the malecon. You do not need to walk, you can see it from your car",
          "Malecon (especially in the center) is a dissapointment. The small green areas and beaches are neglected, especially Montesinos beach - that is filled with garbage. The traffic on the Malecon is really heavy, pavements are narrow, so it's not the best place for a walk.",
          "I'm unsure about everything else except the view. It's very relaxing and somewhat quiet. Good place to walk nearby.",
          "Long road. Lots of cars. VERY hard to cross the street. A young man helped us cross. We did not ask him too. Then he tried to rape my shoes. I was not scared, just really annoyed. I just wanted to enjoy the walk and my day - is that too much to ask? Anyway, the",
          "I very much enjoyed the walk along the Malecon. Sat on edge to listen to waves. Very relaxing place to go to.",
          "The Malecon is a nice stroll from the Colonial Zone, There are major hotels and restaurants along the Malecon. There is an area along the Malecon where one can relax and enjoy the nice Dominican breeze.",
          "Full view of Caribbean Sea! Place to walk along side of waterfront! Lots of hotels, casinos' ! Some nite life inside casino!!",
          "Stayed at the Jaragua hotel right in front of the malec\u00f3n and went to a restaurant on the malec\u00f3n, nice boulevard to stroll, noticed that they are making renovations and it needs better lighting through the streets.",
          "Beautiful road by the ocean but the building in the area looks ruins lots of trailers. Traffic very heavy most of the time. Don't walk alone the city it's dangerous",
          "Coworkers took me here to have dinner with a view. It was a quaint place that had good food. The price was good as well. I recommend it.",
          "I love the Malecon, I feel is the crown jewel of Santo Domingo but is such a pity it is very dirty because Dominicans don't seem to really care about their own treasure. I refuse to drop cups or empty bottles, I refuse to be part of the mess. The Malecon is beautiful even dirty,",
          "Everywhere in the world, the seafront is expensive and exclusive; but in Santo Domingo. Different governments have tried to improved it, but for some reasons it does not become a great place to visit. You can walk some parts if not local. Does not expect too much",
          "Go to Adrian Tropical for the best local food there is. The portions were huge and the price was perfect. You can walk the George Washington Avenue until you can go anymore. Great shopping and great food.",
          "I went for a walk in the afternoon, it was too hot, and there were a LOT of cars and trucks, impossible for me to cross the street, so I waited like 10 minutes inhaling the contamination and sweating. We finally crossed the street running, before any car comes, we just headed to",
          "You will not really see tourists here. The water and beach was full of trash. Pretty dirty. A few restaurants along, we did not try any. Fisherman, kids swimming with plastic bottles around them...",
          "This shoreline is okay, there are definitely better kept, prettier locations in the city. I wouldn't adviser walking around in the evening/at night on your own or in a small group.",
          "Lack of maintenance, lack of cleaning and lack of security. It could be so much more, being the face of Sto.Domingo Everything is there , it's just so terribly neglected for a very large part. Good places to eat, but who wants to go there in darkness between the smell of",
          "On our way to the beach Juan Doli\u00f3 we drove through the malec\u00f3n. Nice views. The air is not polluted around there. Pure oxygen. Blue beach and nice breezes. Nice ride.",
          "The walkway is a wonderful place for a walk or run along the Oceanfront. While in some need of repair we could see evidence of work in progress which implies a revival is taking place. During the day this is the ideal place for tourists and families to enjoy the breezes and",
          "So much life, music and amazing views. Wonderful place to come and absorb the culture this country has to offer. The locals are lucky to have this.",
          "Once the jewel of the DR, el Malecon is now just another average ocean drive. Quite noisy and crowded with vehicles. A few decent restaurants remain, mostly of native food, by the sea. The hotels along the avenue have been revamped, but are not what they used to be. It can be",
          "There are a few restaurants and places to hang out here. I enjoyed to taking in some nice fresh air listening to karaoke by the water. Its a good place to go when you don't want to spend much money.",
          "This street is closed on their Independence Day for the parade, a great time to check it out, I stayed at a hotel on this street",
          "Interesting place. You can go for a long walk along the sea. In the evenings it gets noisy and crowded. Locals visit this place in large numbers.",
          "The mall has almost everything. We first stopped in the food court which has many American fast food chain stores. My favorite shop Bath and Beyond is now present there.",
          "The sex tourism industry has caused this area to become rather seedy if you're just walking the streets. The shoe shine boys will approach you and make it very clear that they can get you \"whatever you want\" so be cautious. Agree on a price BEFORE they clean your shoes. They",
          "Had an amazing lunch with boyfriend. Amazing and delicious food at one of the restaurants overlooking the sea. Have to go again. I'm still drooling over how amazing the food was.",
          "It is an avenue, almost a highway, not specially well kept where are situated the more expensive hotels of Santo Domingo. No beaches just stones. Be careful when you cross it because the cars don't stop even on zebra crosses.",
          "We walked all around the Malecon it was a nice day not cold or hot. Its nice for couples, kids with birds and other people around. The people here in Santo Domingo is very nice and friendly.",
          "Malecon is a very long and beautiful avenue on the coast of Santo Domingo. You have good Restaurants, bars, o just enjoy a walk. I do not recommend to walk alone at night. Malecon (real name is Ave. George Washington) is one of the most nicer avenues you can walk in the world,",
          "Generally the Malecon is a nice, but rather long stroll. We didn't see much on our rather long walk in the evening (around 6pm), where we walked from the colonial city out to Adrian Tropical restaurant. The fun might start on the other side, don't know. BUT we did have one of",
          "I love driving through the Malecon whenever I visit. The sea, sun and palm trees make for a beautiful view",
          "The malecon is literally the most beautiful section of the capital but sadly enough over the years , the government has neglected this area for many reasons. One of the reasons for the neglect is because the city's upper class moved from this area a long time ago , to Piantini,",
          "We bought couple beers, a cooler, and couple folding chairs and sat by the water, in the Malec\u00f3n area and it was fantastic. We chat, laughed, and had a couple beers in a very open, relaxing area. This has always been a favorite for me. Especially to play games, dominoes, listen",
          "Perfect blend of calm,excitement and romance- based on which way you lean. My de- stressor place as well as my place to increasing my excitement, just by taking a walk and taking in nature and the different places along the Malecon, including one of the branches of Caribbean",
          "Growing up in Santo Domingo I do have great memories of El Malecon, where friends and families meet to chill out, listen to music and have a drink. Neglected for a while I see a come back, lot of work is done and free entertainment is coming back to stay",
          "I love coming down to the malecon. It's great for all types of people. Families who want to enjoy an ice cream together, couples strolling down together for a date or a group of friends who are looking for some fun.",
          "Great place during the day ! I don't recommend going late at night. Otherwise the views and the weather are breathtaking.",
          "Lovely place, but very dirty. I loved the el obelisco and the water front. Though it is not recommended to swim there, you have go kart, food spots and other little attractions. It's an amazing, calming and beautiful place but needs upkeep as the shore was filled with a blanket",
          "beautiful view :) just becareful dont go to close to the ocean the wave get very high and gets dangerous if u get too close the water :)",
          "This is a wonderful of the beach! They have restaurants around and at night there is music and fun though I don't recommend being alone at night. The people are very hospitable and the area is breathtaking. I recommend it for both couples and families. Great place!",
          "It was worth visiting will visit again I will recommend it to all my friends the place is very safe and clean the atmosphere is worth seeing I will come again and again on my next vacation",
          "Santo Domingo is located near the water.The heart of the city, or Colonial zone was originally settled by the Ozama River and its outing to the Caribbean Ocean for obvious trading reasons. As the city has grown, it's business center is now between Lincoln and George Washington",
          "Despite the trash along the beach, this is still a beautiful view of the ocean. Especially at sunset. Watch out for shoe shine boys as well. They can be persistent.",
          "I wanted to come in at night because my hotel was a good walk away but was told it was dangerous at night for tourist. So, we visit during the day but there isn't much to see all the food kiosk were closed. Overall it was a good walk.",
          "We stayed at a hotel along the Malecon. On the weekends, they have all kinds of activities here. There is a large public area with food and go -karting included. It can be quite crowded especially with children.",
          "This is a nice street to drive by, a bit lonely to walk due to heavy traffic and dark at night since there are many trees. Nice view of the caribbean sea. Very few spots to enjoy pieces of sand. A bit polluted. You need to get to the closest beach called Boca Chica if you",
          "The beach here is not for swimming but for a great long walk to see local people chilling with beer, wine, and pizza! There are tree along the walk, but still it is very hot. So may be you might want to buy a local wide hat before coming here.",
          "Great place to go for a walk, its near to the zona colonial so you can go after the walk and have a good dinner or some drinks, there are many hotel with casino.",
          "The Malecon is a great place to get in a walk or a jog while you're travelling in the city. The ocean view is excellent.",
          "This is the waterfront of Santo Domingo. Is very lengthy (many kms). There are some spots along the way for people to eat informal street food (would not recommend) and a couple of restaurants along the way (would only recommend one or two). Visited mostly by locals. Be aware of",
          "its a great place to go and see the hole carribean sea although it needs soms repear and maybe some safty at night",
          "For some reason, even though Santo Domingo is on the water and has a great deal of potential, for some reason, the city has not done a very good job keeping up the waterfront promenade called the Malecon. During the day, the sun reveals cracked sidewalks, lots of litter, broken",
          "When in the area, my wife and I love to stroll the Malecon and enjoy the blue waters and Dominican culture. We particularly like the Monument to the Sisters, and the venues for music and cocktails nearby.",
          "We visited the Malecon a few times during a week long visit. I enjoyed the outdoor gym and watching the nightly zumba class. There are lots of places to walk and a good playground for young kids nearby. The central area near the development seems quite safe. There always was",
          "Love it.... \u00c0 lot of activities at night by the ocean very romantic for a long walk very nice hotel, club and casino around. But durant the day is a nightmare with the traffic.... That give you time to enjoy the ocean",
          "The most gorgeous view, during the day, afternoon or night......just gorgeous to watch the ocean, the view is simply spectacular. The Malecon is known as the worlds largest nightclub..........once the sun goes down it is beer, music and dancing till 3 or 4 am!! The view from",
          "It's very packed sometimes, but friendly people, restaurants and bars, great place to walk and relax.",
          "I love to walk along the malecon and feel the breeze of the sea on the warm nights of Santo Domingo.",
          "We had a taxi drop us off and we walked the Malecon to Zona Colonial. It was a great way to see the culture from a different perspective and great photo opportunities. I was a bit disappointed to see the shoreline with so much trash, as it is a beautiful place. We were",
          "This coast line is huge... long and great views... Just stroll down with a car or get down and walk... a breeze near the ocean! it is something to do, maybe not in the evening as it could be not as safe! this is to come and see when you come to DR!! enjoy",
          "great to watch the sunset , or walk by the \" malecon\" or long avenue , great pictures spots of the Caribbean",
          "Great views, friendly people, great local food. Just need to walk around to enjoy the culture. Great place",
          "The Malecon has great views of the ocean and the sidewalk/grounds are kept clean. The problem is a lot of men hang out on the walls (usually drunk), so single females can't walk 3 steps without a whistle/hoot, which can get pretty irritating after awhile.",
          "Not getting any better over time. Traffic backed up all day, hotel strip sub par, totally unusable beach front plagued by thugs. Another example of a missed opportunity in Santo Domingo. this should be the jewel in the crown.",
          "I was very surprised and underwhelmed at the Malecon in Santo Domingo. Loads of garbage/homeless people everywhere. I am surprised local government doesn't do more to clean and preserve this area as it can be a magnet for tourist activity!",
          "The views are great, yet when they say access to all they mean long walks or cab rides. Was told there was a mall in the area also. NOT TRUE. great place to stay and see, not a lot to do during the day.",
          "While the view to the ocean is wonderful, this is a very busy, noisy roadway. Lots of trucks, buses, cars and traffic. Not as well maintained as it should be",
          "Just across our hotel is the malecon. If you like to do jogging,running early in the morning, this is the place to just enjoy the ocean. There's plenty of restaurants if you feel hungry for breakfast. I enjoyed it myself. Just be careful when you cross the road going back to",
          "Great rugged coast line, a couple of nice restaurants and the view is surf littered with rafts of garbage and plastic bottles. One could most set up a plastic recycle plant and harvest the bottles littered along the shore and floating in the surf. What a shame.",
          "this is a nice walk by the water and the views are great but the area is dirty. there is garbage on the ground and vagabonds running around. its a shame because i can see a lot of potential for this area. there is a nice monument and other historic areas nearby.",
          "The view and the entertainment are very good. There is a new entertainment area for kids close to Pizzareli. I really wish I had more time to walk more there.",
          "the Malecon stretches along the coast of santo Domingo and looks lovely and inviting to stroll. However pick your time! during the day probably OK to walk but t's too hot! but after 5pm and definitely at night it's definitely safe! They are a few police around but scattered few",
          "Great avenue, great view. Full of restaurants, hotels, border of the Caribbean Sea in Santo DOMINGO City. Good for walking at the end of the afternoon for sunset....",
          "We walked on the Malecon for an hour and it's beautiful. The heartbreaking part is the amount of trash you will see on the grass or at sea. The view is spectacular and for those who have been in Havana in Cuba it's the same feel just a little less overwhelming.",
          "El Malecon is actually the George Washington ave. Great to see the caribbean ocean, it has hotels and restaurants, just don't walk around",
          "If you look like a tourist, then you may have difficulty not attracting unwanted invitations to whatever. I gave up quickly and stuck to using a car. There is a nice authentic restaurant by the sea, though, and the food is very good.",
          "The fact that several hotels are located in the area like Hilton, etc, is you can walk in the very morning, it has a great feeling will sorround you, very calm fresh air and sea. I was staying in bella vista and its neat where am I and I never got tired to see this place every",
          "while I must suggest you use caution as most cities in the world there is a certain amount of homeless or transients etc... So use commen sense. But if you stay in the area that is close to the zona colonial there is a lot of security and you will find that there is a small",
          "I'll have to agree with \"Cory M\", I was taken aback by the amount of trash collected along Malecon beach. Even more disgusted when I saw children swimming in the water. If you visit Santo Domingo don't swim in Malecon instead take a cab to Boca Chica.",
          "El Male\u00f3n is a long stretch of sea coast between Santo Domingo city and the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo Malec\u00f3n is about 12 or 13 kilometers long. A great variety of caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants, malls and hotels are along the road, which western half is named Autopista 30 de Mayo,",
          "If this a main attraction then the country does not care about its country. Sounds horrible but true. A Germany reviewer said it best. I came here (for two weeks) and thought there would be some pleasure in the area.....I have also spent a lot of time in South America and Asia.",
          "Malecon is a unique sea front area with amusement area food and beverage sellers. The only reason I did not rate a 5 is because of the garage and broken bottle left by homeless people on various areas. A a rare treasure do not miss it if in the Santo Domingo area.",
          "I stayed at the Renaissance Jaragua Hotel and Casino fronting the Malecon. It is great for running of walking. It is very safe even at night. Beautiful view of the ocean. Great place to mingle with the locals. Play volleyball or just the outdoor exercise.",
          "Stayed at the Hilton on the malecon. Walked around the area. Visited the park with all the workout equipment. Be advised, some places can be dangerous at night. Still a great place to visit.",
          "This is where you want to be if you really want to see the city! Lots of street music and venders. And the most amazing views of the sea! The waves crashing on the rocks were a vision that will never leave my mind! Everyone is so friendly I felt safe being there at night. Music",
          "A pleasant waterfront walking area, although when traffic is heavy the exhaust fumes and noise can be distracting",
          "the malecon its very nice there every night you can find music and entartaiment all night and you can eat sandwiches very good and fresh drink beer and sit down to take a breeze of the ocean.",
          "Since I was a child my dream was to stay in one of those hotels just to look at the ocean thanks God my dream came through the first hotel my wife an I went was Napolitano great view and just recently CROWN PLAZA EXCELLENT VIEW AND BES QUALITY SO FAR",
          "I'm Dominican don't get me wrong i would not talk against my country just for the heck of it,but the Truth always gonna come out so i always tried to speak it. The Malecon it's one of our principal attractions in the capital Santo Domingo we were staying at the Sheraton and",
          "I was very surprised that one of the main attraction, which is the sea and the closest road towards it, is so bad in shape. For me as a hard working person it is not understandable why the dominicans are so uncareing with their culture and nature. Let me give you an example: you",
          "Nice place to walk with your couple, feel the air in your hair and hear the waves in the ocean. Really romantic place also a nice place to talk with your friends sit and drink a coconut water.",
          "The city needs to work on pollution and security issues. The place could be nice if sewage wasn't dumped and it was maintained better, after all, Santo Domingo doesn't have too many touristic activities aside from la zona.",
          "Trying to get some tan. Just in front of Hilton Hotel. Good place to hang out during daytime. Several places to eat. Nice place",
          "One of the beauties of visiting an island. You can find an area where you can legitimately stand on the edge of the ocean. A place you can visit over and over again and never get tired.",
          "I love the Malecon, you can spend an afternoon or running breathing fresh air, have an area for sports, you meet many people exercising, have several outdoor restaurants, very clean, you can spend a very pleasant evening.",
          "good place to visit, beatifull and the wave awsome to practice kitesurf, people are very cool and all the time wants to help you",
          "This Malecon is nothing like the one in Habana. It is broken down with cracked paving stones, rubbish everywhere and the constant roar of traffic making crossing the road a death defying challenge. It is quite pleasant to be by the sea for a while. Not worth visiting.",
          "Per say its not an attraction, it should be the highest most expensive area of the capital and it is not, home to a few good hotels and also Adrian Tropical a restaurant with good service and food in the middle of the malecon, if you are staying near, its a good morning walk,",
          "My last visit to El Malec\u00f3n was quick because i was heading to another city but i was happy to see the city trying to make environmental and structural improvements to this place over the time, it's wonderful to take a walk before sunrise because you will have the chance to see",
          "For being the capital sea front boulevard, the malecon would deserve a better treatment, although some improvements have already been done (the whole peaton area has been recently renewed). The major improvement will soon come from the prohibition for the trucks to use that",
          "El Malecon, used to be the hangout spot back in the days. Now it has lost it's charm and only a few struggling restaurants [bad food] stand by the beach. For a tourist, it is safer to go during the day. Now it is not much to see. It is now dirty and not well kept. Has tons of",
          "I usually drive down starting in the middle coming from the corner of Hotel Santo Domingo. The long street with the beautiful ocean view is like endless, passing all the famous restaurants, clubs and hotel with its casinos. Each time going there I have to stop in VESUVIO for",
          "We were in Santo Domingo in January 2015 and found the malecon one of the nicest sites of Santo Domingo. It is relatively clean. Somebody can walk for kilometers while enjoying the beautiful water of sea, and the warm breeze. While we were there, there wasn't very much people",
          "There is an ocean view but no true beach. There is a very small beach ( not the best ). It tends to be ver, very busy so If you are uncomfortable around many people, this is not your place to go. Also be aware that it is a place were many tourists get robbed or mugged, so please",
          "I was hoping to walk a good length of the malecon and see what Santo Domingo had to offer outside the Zona Colonial. We stopped for lunch at a restaurant along the water. The view was wonderful, the food OK. We didn't end up walking too far. The coastline and beaches are riddled",
          "The Malecon runs the length of Santo Domingo along the cool Caribbean crystal clear waters. Dominicans being who they are, most evenings will park along the highway/local street, turn up the music and sit there with a group of people partying, dancing and drinking their",
          "Not that clean and smells of a bathroom where the seats are, should be public bathrooms, and the sea is a bit of a garbage tip but if you are up and want to walk or jog, its an ok place to be.",

          "This could have been a gorgeous shore walk but instead it is filthy,noisy, and dangerous. There are parts that are too dangerous to walk along in the middle of the day. The government is trying to fix it up but as of right now you should not plan on walking on any part of it.",

          "In the past, this was not a great place to walk, day or night. But Santo Domingo authorities have invested a great deal to clean the place up, even opening up a playground in an area once frequented only by the homeless. The biggest difficulty a visitor will find is crossing",
          "The Malecon of Santo Domingo is really beautiful. Of course, it would be nicer if those in charge would invest some more to keep it shinning. I can not complaint, because many times during my visits there, I go there for long walks, to relax, and to have fun as well. You can",

In this mass, Pope was facing the original painting of the Virgin of Altagracia, which was taken especially from the Bas\u00edlica Catedral Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Altagracia for the occasion.\n\n\n== Tomb of the Unknown Dominican Soldier and Flags ==\nThe tomb of the soldier who died for the freedom of the Dominicans.\nNumerous masts in the square marking the perimeter and all of them are hoisted flags of the Dominican Republic are located. In addition, the triumphal arch of the center of the square is also used as single mast because it has a halyard with another flag of the Dominican Republic, it hoisted larger than those in the above waving masts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

          "We toured the home of Columbus' son today, and it was interesting. We used the audio tour devices, which were old and not functioning especially well. But you either need to use them or go on a formal tour, otherwise you will miss all the important details. It is hot inside, so",

          "A must visit place when in Santo Domingo. This is a really interesting piece of history - well restored and maintained. We took the audio headsets and the tour included interesting bits about each of the rooms - but probably if you're interested in more details it's worthwhile",
          "Another beautifully restored building from the early 1500s. One of the first buildings in the New World! There's an inexpensive tour which includes audio. Well worth it. Afterwards, sit out in the plaza under the trees and enjoy an ice cream from the local hielado man.",

          "The last time I visited Alcazar de Colon we had a docent leading our tour. He was excited and very knowledgable about the history of the place. This time we rented headsets with a self guided system. Fine, but many of the descriptions were very brief and left out many of the",

          "We weren\u2019t inside the museum, but even from the outside it\u2019s worth the visit. The huge area in front is full of people just hanging out or dancing to music by some local musicians and there are a lot of restaurants where you can grab a good bite.",

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

        "wiki": "The Historic Center (US) or Centre (UK; Portuguese: Centro Hist\u00f3rico) of Salvador de Bahia in Brazil, also known as the Pelourinho (Portuguese for \"Pillory\") or Pelo, is a historic neighborhood in western Salvador, Bahia. It was the city's center during the Portuguese colonial period and was named for the whipping post in its central plaza where enslaved people from Africa were publicly beaten as punishment for alleged infractions. The Historic Center is extremely rich in historical monuments dating from the 17th through the 19th centuries.\nSalvador was the first colonial capital of Brazil and the city is one of the oldest in the New World (founded in 1549 by Portuguese settlers). It was also one of the first slave markets on the continent, with slaves arriving to work on the sugar plantations. The area is in the older part of the upper city (Cidade Alta) of Salvador. It encompasses several blocks around the triangular Largo, and it is the location for music, dining and nightlife. It has a place on the national historic register and was named a world cultural center by UNESCO in 1985.In the 1990s, a $100 million restoration effort led by a conservative political coalition tied to then-governor Antonio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es resulted in the removal of over 4,000 mainly Afro-Bahian residents and the conversion of a once-vital neighborhood into a pastel-hued tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\nSalvador's Historic Center comprises the colonial city's primitive nucleus and its geographical expansion until the end of the 18th century. From Pra\u00e7a Municipal, open within the dense tropical forest by the first general-governor, Tom\u00e9 de Sousa, in 1549, to largo de Santo Ant\u00f4nio Al\u00e9m do Carmo, battle field where Portuguese and Dutch soldiers from Companhia das \u00cdndias Ocidentais fought in 1638, monuments of civil, religious and military architecture make up a scenery that reveals Salvador's inhabitants art and way of living through the centuries. From Portas de Santa Luzia, which kept the southern boundary of the old city safe, with mud walls, to the thick walls of Fort Santo Ant\u00f4nio Al\u00e9m do Carmo, which guarded the north entrance, Salvador's Historic Center is divided in three areas that can be visited all at once: from Pra\u00e7a Municipal to Largo de S\u00e3o Francisco, Pelourinho, and from Largo do Carmo to Largo de Santo Ant\u00f4nio Al\u00e9m do Carmo.\nThe area between Pra\u00e7a Municipal and Largo de S\u00e3o Francisco chronologically starts from the place chosen by general-governor Tom\u00e9 de Souza for the construction of the Colonial Government buildings, and in the places occupied by religious brotherhoods that came from Europe in 1549. Pra\u00e7a Municipal was opened because it offered better protection against attacks by natives and corsairs. The Governor's House, the City Hall, the Chapel of Our Lady of Help, and other structures were initially made of mud wall and covered with straw, but later re-built with stone, bricks, and lime. Nowadays, the visitors' preferred historic buildings are the Pa\u00e7o Municipal (completed in the end of the 17th century), the Rio Branco Palace (Pal\u00e1cio Rio Branco, built on the site of the former Governor's House in 1919), and the Lacerda Elevator(Elevador Lacerda), amplified in the thirties. Towards the north are Church and Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia (Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Miseric\u00f3rdia). The Customs Building at Cayr\u00fa Square was constructed in 1861. The Model Market (Mercado Modelo) near the foot of the elevator in the Com\u00e9rcio district claims to be the largest handicraft market in Latin America.The Church of the Holy See (Igreja da S\u00e9), an integral part of the architectural set of the Historic Center, was demolished in 1933 along with four other blocks of buildings from the colonial and imperial periods. The Archbishop's Palace, connected to the church, remains. Debates over the destruction of historic sites in Salvador and elsewhere in Brazil led to the first attempts at federal-level protection of historic assets and eventually to the establishment of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage.The Terreiro de Jesus, just north of Pra\u00e7a Municipal, is home to structures from the 17th to 19th century constructions. Catedral Basilica, former Igreja dos Jesu\u00edtas (Jesuit Church), and churches Ordem Terceira de S\u00e3o Domingos and Church of Saint Peter of the Clergymen (S\u00e3o Pedro dos Cl\u00e9rigos) stand out in Terreiro de Jesus, with its beautiful water fountain in the center.The former Medical School Building, originally occupied by the Jesuit School, is now the Memorial da Medicina (Medicine Memorial), Arqueologia e Etnologia (Archeology and Ethnology), and Afro-Brasileiro (Afro-Brazilian) museums. The House of the Seven Lamps (Casa dos Sete Candeeiros), now a museum, is nearby. Largo do Cruzeiro de S\u00e3o Francisco (Cruzeiro de S\u00e3o Francisco Largo), practically an extension of Terreiro de Jesus, has an old cross in the center, and, on the back, the monumental religious set made up of S\u00e3o Franscisco Church and Convent, and Church of the Third Order of Saint Francis (Ordem Terceira de S\u00e3o Franscisco Church). The Church of the Third Order of Our Lady of the Rosary of the Black People (Igreja da Ordem Terceira de Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio dos Pretos), Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo, and Church of the Third Order of Mount Carmel are located further north in the district. Numerous colonial-period historic residences, including the Palace of Saldanha, are located on streets outside of the main plazas. \nMany buildings of the Historic Center have been renovated since the initial survey of Salvador by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in the 1930s. This work extended to the revitalization of whole blocks of historic houses, convents, and churches from the beginning of the 1990s. There are more than 800 buildings with restored fa\u00e7ades and interiors; many were adapted to function as small museums and cultural centers.\n\n\n== Protected status ==\nThe Historic Center of Salvador as a whole was listed as a national heritage site by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1984. It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPelourinho digital media archive (creative commons-licensed photos, laser scans, panoramas) from a CyArk/UNESCO research partnership.\n(in English, French, and Dutch) discovering Salvador and Bahia in your language.\nHistoric Centre of Salvador de Bahia UNESCO property on google arts and culture",

          "this is a little off the beaten path. we walked here from the downtown area. Nobody else was here, just us. The vendors all called us to their booths, they all basically sell the same stuff. Lots of jewelry, knick knacks, clothes, gift wares, key chains, spices, shot",
          "this place is like a flea market and you will find everything from thst country, hand made ,shirts and all kinds of things .",
          "Going back 40 some years ago I found this to be an exciting place to visit . Many more products , much more indicative of life in Santo Domingo in the \"good old days\" .",
          "Visited almost every month ! Any Visitor is taken there by me as to immerse them in our culture as we talk and walk showing them about the LADIES THAT SELLS HERBS (we make sooo many different teas to cure illnesses !) and here is where the Specialists are !; about our religion,",

          "This is where you find the Dominican Republic all in one location. From food, treats, liquor, souvenirs, knick-knacks, clothing, unique furniture, and paintings... this is the place to visit. Be aware though, prices are not consistent and you must haggle. Other than that it",
          "My trip was March 7, 2018. We stop at the Mercado Modelo to buy some souvenirs to bring back to the states. My sister bought a painting and had it stretch for 400 pesos. That is right! 400 Dominican pesos. That is USD 8.15. $400 Dominican pesos divided by $49.10",
          "I had purchased coconut oil a few years ago on a excursion to Saona Island and just loved it on my skin. I wasn't prepared to take the trip back to Saona Island just to get more. I recently, February 21st, went with a group of friends to Mercado Modelo. I asked a vendor if they",
          "The Mercado Modelo is a good traditional market if you are looking for local crafts and local stone\u2019s jewelry like larimar and Amber, as well as Dominican musical instruments and other typical artifacts, paintings and more. Beware with many Haitian and fake crafts everywhere.",

          "While this market offers a lot of dominican artworks be careful because there is a lot of non authentic dominican artifacts and Haitian things . Amber, larimar and dominican carnival masks can be found. Ask for discounts or come with a local to help get the real prices !",
          "You will be bothered by all the vendors as you walk through this market. The goods are generic tourist stuff. I didn't buy anything because the vendors bothered me so much.",
          "Great variety of choice in one place. All prices are negotiable (discounts up to 50-60% can be asked), especially if buying several items at one store. I would recommend not to waist money at the beach shops, but come here is there is such a chance.",
          "I thought overall the merchandise was cheap quality. The typical souvenirs t-shirts, paintings, magnetic holders, local jewelry, some wood crafts but nothing I saw was a must buy and unique. Price haggling is a must, all prices are quoted in $$$, most of the quotes are double",
          "A quick visit to the market with a colleague who has lived in the country for a long time. So, language and haggling on prices was no problem. The cut oil drum prices from Haiti are beautiful and worth the haggle. Some very interesting potions and religious icons on sale, as",

          "Mercado Modelo is at the edge of the Zonal Colonial. I hate being harassed. I love to shop but I felt haggled by all the shopkeepers to go in their stores and so I left after 5 minutes. I would have loved to be able to just walk around. Also, the store I did go in tried to sell",
          "The Mercado Modelo is an excellent place to buy souvenirs, you can find a huge variety of things. The prices are really good, you just need to bargain a little. Many shoppes have their own craft makers, so you can order some things to be made as you like. The Market is not",

          "Just a tip, anything costs always half the first price they tell you.",

          "Word of advice- if you are flying out of Santo Domingo, buy your souvenirs here. They are much cheaper and have more of a variety than most tourist areas. Don't forget you can bargain- don't just immediately go with the price they give you without giving them a counter-offer.",

Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports. Aeropuerto Internacional La Isabela a newly constructed airport located in the northern section of the city, within kilometres of the city center. It serves mostly domestic and charter flights. The major international airport that serves the city is Santo Domingo Las Americas, which serves North, Central and South America and also Europe.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Santo Domingo is located on the Ozama River. Its location at the center of the Caribbean is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\nThe port's renovation is part of a major redevelopment project, aimed at integrating the port area and the Zona Colonial and foster a cruise, yacht, and high-end tourism destination. Supported by legislation approved in 2005, the project, developed by the Sans Souci Group, also includes the development of a new sports marina and a 122-acre (0.49 km2) mixed-leisure real estate development adjacent to the port.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\nSanto Domingo is the terminus for four of the five national highways.

        "wiki": "The city of Cartagena ( KAR-t\u0259-JEE-n\u0259, also US:  -\u2060HAY-n\u0259), known in the colonial era as Cartagena de Indias (Spanish: [ka\u027eta\u02c8xena \u00f0e \u02c8indjas] (listen)), is a city and major port on the northern coast of Colombia in the Caribbean Coast Region. Founded in 1533, city's strategic location between the Magdalena and Sin\u00fa Rivers gave it easy access to the interior of New Granada and made it a main port for trade between Spain and its overseas empire, establishing its importance by the early 1540s. During the colonial era it was a key port for the export of Peruvian silver to Spain and for the import of enslaved Africans under the asiento system. It was defensible against pirate attacks in the Caribbean.Modern Cartagena is the capital of the Bol\u00edvar Department, and had a population of 1,028,736, according to the 2018 census, making it the second-largest city in the region, after Barranquilla, and the fifth-largest city in Colombia. The urban area of Cartagena is also the fifth-largest urban area in the country. Economic activities include the maritime and petrochemicals industries, as well as tourism.\nThe present city\u2014named after Cartagena, Spain\u2014was founded on 1 June 1533; but settlement by various indigenous people in the region around Cartagena Bay dates from 4000 BC. During the Spanish colonial period Cartagena served a key role in administration and expansion of the Spanish empire. It was a center of political, ecclesiastical, and economic activity. In 1984, Cartagena's colonial walled city and fortress were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era: 4000 BC \u2013 1500 AD ===\nThe Puerto Hormiga Culture, found in the Caribbean coast region, particularly in the area from the Sin\u00fa River Delta to the Cartagena Bay, appears to be the first documented human community in what is now Colombia. Archaeologists estimate that around 4000 BC, the formative culture was located near the boundary between the present-day departments of Bol\u00edvar and Sucre. In this area, archaeologists have found the most ancient ceramic objects of the Americas, dating from around 4000 BC. The primary reason for the proliferation of primitive societies in this area is thought to have been the relative mildness of climate and the abundance of wildlife, which allowed the hunting inhabitants a comfortable life.Archaeological investigations date the decline of the Puerto Hormiga culture and its related settlements to around 3000 BC. The rise of a much more developed culture, the Mons\u00fa, who lived at the end of the Dique Canal near today's Cartagena neighborhoods Pasacaballos and Ci\u00e9naga Honda at the northernmost part of Bar\u00fa Island, has been hypothesized. The Mons\u00fa culture appears to have inherited the Puerto Hormiga culture's use of the art of pottery and also to have developed a mixed economy of agriculture and basic manufacture. The Mons\u00fa people's diet was based mostly on shellfish and fresh and salt-water fish.The development of the Sin\u00fa society in what is today the departments of C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre, eclipsed these first developments around the Cartagena Bay area. Until the Spanish colonization, many cultures derived from the Karib, Malibu and Arawak language families lived along the Colombian Caribbean coast. In the late pre-Columbian era, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta was home to the Tayrona people, whose language was closely related to the Chibcha language family.Around 1500 the area was inhabited by different tribes of the Carib language family, more precisely the Mocanae sub-family.\nMocana villages of the Carib people around the Bay of Cartagena included:\non sandy island facing the ocean in what is present-day downtown: Kalamar\u00ed (Calamari)\non the island of Tierrabomba: Carex\non Isla Bar\u00fa, then a peninsula: Bahaire\non present-day Mamonal, the eastern coast of the exterior bay: Cospique\nin the suburban area of Turbaco: Yurbaco TribeHeredia found these settlements, \"...largely surrounded with the heads of dead men placed on stakes.\"Some subsidiary tribes of the Kalamari lived in today's neighborhood of Pie de la Popa, and other subsidiaries from the Cospique lived in the Membrillal and Pasacaballos areas. Among these, according to the earliest documents available, the Kalamari had preeminence. These tribes, though physically and administratively separated, shared a common architecture, such as hut structures consisting of circular rooms with tall roofs, which were surrounded by defensive wooden palisades.\n\n\n=== First sightings by Europeans: 1500\u20131533 ===\nRodrigo de Bastidas traveled to the Pearl Coast and the Gulf of Uraba in 1500\u201301. On 14 February 1504, Ferdinand V contracted Juan de la Cosa's voyage to Uraba. However, Juan de la Cosa died in 1510 along with 300 of Alonso de Ojeda's men, after an armed confrontation with indigenous people, and before Juan de la Cosa could get possession of the Gulf of Urab\u00e1 area. Similar contracts were signed in 1508 with Diego de Nicuesa for the settlement of Veragua and with Alonso de Ojeda for the settlement of Uraba, \"where gold had already been obtained on earlier voyages,\" according to Floyd.After the failed effort to find Antigua del Dari\u00e9n in 1506 by Alonso de Ojeda and the subsequent unsuccessful founding of San Sebasti\u00e1n de Urab\u00e1 in 1517 by Diego de Nicuesa, the southern Caribbean coast became unattractive to colonizers. They preferred the better known Hispaniola and Cuba.Although the royal control point for trade, the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n gave permission to Rodrigo de Bastidas (1460\u20131527) to again conduct an expedition as adelantado to this area, Bastidas explored the coast and sighted the Magdalena River Delta in his first journey from Guajira to the south in 1527, a trip that ended in the Gulf of Urab\u00e1, the location of the failed first settlements. De Nicuesa and De Ojeda noted the existence of a big bay on the way from Santo Domingo to Urab\u00e1 and the Panama isthmus, and that encouraged Bastidas to investigate.\n\n\n=== Colonial era: 1533\u20131717 ===\n\nUnder contract to Queen Joanna of Castile, Pedro de Heredia entered the Bay of Cartagena with three ships, a lighter, 150 men, and 22 horses, on 14 January 1533. He soon found the village of Calamari abandoned. Proceeding onwards to Turbaco, where Juan de la Cosa had been mortally wounded 13 years earlier, Heredia fought an all-day battle before claiming victory. Using India Catalina as a guide, Heredia embarked on a three-month exploration expedition. He returned to Calamari in April 1533 with gold pieces, including a solid gold porcupine weighing 132 pounds. In later expeditions, Heredia raided the Sin\u00fa tombs and temples of gold. His rule as governor of Cartagena lasted 22 years, before perishing on his return to Spain in 1544.Cartagena was founded on 1 June 1533 by the Spanish commander, Pedro de Heredia, in the former location of the indigenous Caribbean Calamar\u00ed village. The town was named after the port city of Cartagena, in Murcia in southeast Spain, where most of Heredia's sailors had resided. King Philip II gave Cartagena the title of \"city\" (ciudad) in 1574, adding \"most noble and loyal\" in 1575.The city's increasing importance as a port for the export of Peruvian silver from Potos\u00ed to Spain, made it an obvious target for pirates and corsairs, encouraged by France, England, and Holland. In 1544, the city was pillaged by 5 ships and 1000 men under the command of the French pirate Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberval, who took advantage of the city still without walls. Heredia was forced to retreat to Turbaco until a ransom was paid. A defensive tower, San Felipe del Boqueron, was built in 1566 by Governor Anton Davalos. It was supposed to protect the anchorage and the Bahia de las Animas, a water lane into Plaza de lar Mar (current day Plaze de la Aduana), but the fort's battery had limited range. Then the French pirate Martin Cote struck in 1569 with 1000 men, ransacking the city.A few months after the disaster of the invasion of Cote, a fire destroyed the city and forced the creation of a firefighting squad, the first in the Americas.In 1568, Sir John Hawkins of England tried to trick Governor Mart\u00edn de las Alas into violating Spanish law, which forbade trade with foreigners, by opening a trade fair in the city to sell goods. This would have allowed Hawkins to ravage the port afterwards; the governor declined. Hawkins bombarded the city for 8 days, but failed to level it. Then Francis Drake attacked in April 1586 with 23 ships and 3,000 men. Drake burned 200 houses and the cathedral, departing only after a ransom was paid a month later.Spain then commissioned Bautista Antonelli in 1586 to design a master scheme for defending its Caribbean ports. This included a second visit to Cartagena in 1594 when he drew up plans for a walled city.In 1610, the Holy Office of the Inquisition was established in Cartagena and The Palace of Inquisition was completed in 1770. Sentences were pronounced in the main city plaza, today's Plaza de Bolivar, during the Autos de Fe ceremonies. Crimes under its jurisdiction included those of heresy, blasphemy, bigamy and witchcraft. A total of 767 persons were punished, which ranged from fines, wearing a Sanbenito, life imprisonment, or even death for five unlucky souls. The Inquisition was abolished with independence in 1811.\n\nThe first slaves were brought by Pedro de Heredia to work as \"macheteros\", clearing the underbrush. By the 17th Century, Cartagena had become an important New World slave market, centered about the Plaza de los Coches. Europeans began to bring slaves from Africa. Spain was the only European power that could not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves and therefore the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants (mostly from Portugal, France, England and the Dutch Empire) the license to trade enslaved people to their overseas territories.Gov. Francisco de Murga made the Inner Bay an \"impregnable lagoon\", according to Segovia, which included the forts El Boquer\u00f3n, Castillo Grande, Manzanillo, and Manga. Besides the walls built to defend the historic district of Calamari, Francisco de Murga enclosed Getsemani with protective walls starting in 1631. This included the battery of Media Luna of San Antonio, located between the bastions of Santa Teresa and Santa Barbara, which protected the only gate and causeway to the mainland.The practice of Situado, is exemplified in the magnitude of the city's subsidy between 1751 and 1810, when the city received the sum of 20,912,677 Spanish reales.\n\nThe Raid on Cartagena, in April 1697 during the Nine Years' War, by Sir Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis and Jean Baptiste Ducasse was a severe blow to Cartagena. The Baron's forces included 22 large ships, 500 canons, and 4000 troops, while Ducasse's forces consisted of 7 ships and 1,200 buccaneers. They quickly overwhelmed Sancho Jimeno de Orozco's force of 30 men in the San Luis de Bocachica fortification. Then, San Felipe de Barajas also fell and the city came under bombardment. When the Half Moon Gate was breached and Getsemani occupied, Governor Diego de los Rios capitulated. The Baron left after a month of plunder and Ducasse followed a week later.When King Philip II employed the Italian engineer Juan Bautista Antonelli to design a master plan of fortifications for Cartagena, construction would actually continue for the next two hundred years. On 17 March 1640, three Portuguese ships under the command of Rodrigo Lobo da Silva, ran aground in the Bocagrande Channel. This accelerated the formation of a sand bar, which soon connected the Bocagrande Peninsula to the island of Tierrabomba. The defense of the bay then shifted to two forts on either side of Bocachica, San Jose and San Luis de Bocachica. San Luis was replaced by San Fernando after the 1741 English raid. The next narrow passage was formed by the Island of Manzanillo, where San Juan del Manzanillo was constructed and Santa Cruz O Castillo Grande opposite on Cruz Grande at Punta Judio, both connected by a floating chain. Finally, there was San Felipe del Boqueron, later San Sebastian del Pastelillo. The city itself was circled with a ring of bastions connected by curtains. The island of Getsemani was also fortified. Protecting the city on the landward side, atop San Lazaro hill, was the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas named in honor of Spain's King Philip IV and Governor Pedro Zapata de Mendoza, Marquis of Barajas' father, the Count of Barajas. Completed in 1654, the fort was expanded in the 18th Century, and included underground corridors and galleries.\n\n\n=== Viceregal era: 1717\u20131811 ===\nThe 18th century began poorly for the city economically, as the Bourbon dynasty discontinued the Carrera de Indias convoys. However, with the establishment of the Viceroyalty of New Granada and the colonial struggle with England, Cartagena took on the stronghold as the \"gateway to the Indies of Peru\". By 1777, the city included 13,700 inhabitants with a garrison of 1300. The population reached 17,600 in 1809.The reconstruction after the Raid on Cartagena (1697) was initially slow, but with the end of the War of the Spanish Succession around 1711 and the competent administration of Juan D\u00edaz de Torrezar Pimienta, the walls were rebuilt, the forts reorganized and restored, and the public services and buildings reopened. By 1710, the city was fully recovered. At the same time, the slow but steady reforms of the restricted trade policies in the Spanish Empire encouraged the establishment of new trade houses and private projects. During the reign of Philip V of Spain the city had many new public works projects either begun or completed, among them the new fort of San Fernando, the Hospital of the Obra P\u00eda and the full paving of all the streets and the opening of new roads.In 1731, Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor founded the Military Academy of Mathematics and Practice of Fortifications in Cartagena. He is also known for designing the Puerta del Reloj starting in 1704.\n\n\n==== 1741 attack ====\n\nStarting in mid-April 1741, the city endured a siege by a large English armada under the command of Admiral Edward Vernon. The engagement, referred to as Battle of Cartagena de Indias, was part of the larger War of Jenkins' Ear. The English armada included 50 warships, 130 transport ships, and 25,600 men, including 2,000 North American colonial infantry. The Spanish defense was under the command of Sebasti\u00e1n de Eslava and Don Blas de Lezo. The British were able to take the Castillo de San Luis at Bocachica and land marines on the island of Tierrabomba and Manzanillo. The North Americans then took La Popa hill.Following a failed attack on San Felipe Barajas on April 20, 1741, which left 800 British dead and another 1,000 taken prisoner, Vernon lifted the siege. By that time he had many sick men from tropical diseases. An interesting footnote to the battle was the inclusion of George Washington's half brother, Lawrence Washington, amongst the British colonial troops. Lawrence later named his Mount Vernon estate in honor of his commander.\n\n\n==== Silver Age (1750\u20131808) ====\n\nIn 1762, Antonio de Arebalo published his Defense Plan, the Report on the estate of defense on the avenues of Cartagena de Indias. This engineer continued the work to make Cartagena impregnable, including the construction from 1771 to 1778, of a 3400 yards long underwater jetty across the Bocagrande called the Escollera. Arebalo had earlier completed San Fernando, and the fort-battery of San Jose in 1759, then added El Angel San Rafael on El Horno hill as added protection across the Bocachica.After Vernon, what is called the 'Silver Age' of the city (1750\u20131808) began. This time was one of permanent expansion of the existing buildings, massive immigration from all the other cities of the Viceroyalty, increase of the economic and political power of the city and a population growth spurt not equaled since that time. Political power that was already shifting from Bogot\u00e1 to the coast completed its relocation, and the Viceroys decided to reside in Cartagena permanently. The inhabitants of the city were the richest of the colony, the aristocracy erected noble houses on their lands to form great estates, libraries and printing establishments were opened, and the first caf\u00e9 in New Granada was even established. The good times of steady progress and advancement in the second half of the 18th century came to an abrupt end in 1808 with the general crisis of the Spanish Empire that came from the Mutiny of Aranjuez and all its consequences.Among the censuses of the 18th century was the special Census of 1778, imposed by the governor of the time, D. Juan de Torrezar Diaz Pimienta \u2013 later Viceroy of New Granada \u2013 by order of the Marquis of Ensenada, Minister of Finance \u2013 so that he would be provided numbers for his Catastro tax project, which imposed a universal property tax he believed would contribute to the economy while at the same time increasing royal revenues dramatically. The Census of 1778, besides having significance for economic history, required each house to be described in detail and its occupants enumerated, making the census an important tool The census revealed what Ensenada had hoped. However, his enemies in the court convinced King Charles III to oppose the tax plan. \n\n\n=== 1811 to the 21st century ===\n\nFor more than 275 years, Cartagena was under Spanish rule. With Napoleon's imprisonment of Charles IV and Ferdinand VII, and the start of the Peninsular War, the Latin American wars of independence soon followed. In Cartagena, on June 4, 1810, Royal Commissioner Antonio Villavicencio and the Cartagena City Council banished the Spanish Governor Francisco de Montes on suspicions of sympathy for the French emperor and the French occupation forces which overthrew the king. A Supreme Junta was formed, along with two political parties, one led by Jose Maria Garcia de Toledo representing the aristocrats, and a second led by Gabriel and German Pi\u00f1eres representing the common people of Getsemani. Finally on November 11, a Declaration of Independence was signed proclaiming \"a free state, sovereign and independent of all domination and servitude to any power on Earth\". The support for a declaration of independence by working class leader and artisan Pedro Romero was key in pushing the Junta to adopting it.Spain's reaction was to send a \"pacifying expedition\" under the command of Pablo Morillo, The Pacifier, and Pascual de Enrile, which included 59 ships, and 10,612 men. The city was placed under siege on August 22, 1815. The city was defended by 3000 men, 360 cannons, and 8 ships plus ancillary small watercraft, under the command of Manuel del Castillo y Rada and Juan N. Enslava. However, by that time, the city was under the rule of the Garcia de Toledo Party, having exiled German and Gabriel Pineres, and Simon Bolivar. By December 5, about 300 people per day died from hunger or disease, forcing 2000 to flee on vessels provided by the French mercenary Louis Aury. By that time, 6000 had died. Morillo, in retaliation after entering the city, shot nine of the rebel leaders on February 24, 1816, at what is now known as the Camellon de los Martires. These included Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda de Toledo and Manuel del Castillo y Rada.Finally, a patriot army led by General Mariano Montilla, supported by Admiral Jos\u00e9 Prudencio Padilla, laid siege to the city from August 1820 until October 1821. A key engagement was the destruction of almost all of the royalist ships anchored on Getsemani Island on June 24, 1821. After Governor Gabriel Torres surrendered, Simon Bolivar the Liberator, bestowed the title \"Heroic City\" onto Cartagena. The Liberator spent 18 days in the city from July 20\u201328, 1827, staying in the Government Palace in Proclamation Square and the guest of a banquet hosted by Jose Padilla at his residence on Calle Larga.Unfortunately, the toll of war, in particular from Morillo's siege long affected the city. With the loss of the funds it had received as the main colonial military outpost, and the loss of population, the city deteriorated. It suffered a long decline in the aftermath of independence, and was largely neglected by the central government in Bogot\u00e1. In fact, its population did not reach pre-1811 numbers until the start of the 20th century.These declines were also due to disease, including a devastating cholera epidemic in 1849. The Canal del Dique that connected it to the Magdalena River also filled with silt, leading to a drastic reduction in the amount of international trade. The rise of the port of Barranquilla only compounded the decline in trade. During the presidency of Rafael Nu\u00f1ez, who was a Cartagena native, the central government finally invested in a railroad and other infrastructure improvements and modernization that helped the city to recover.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nCartagena faces the Caribbean Sea to the west. To the south is the Cartagena Bay, which has two entrances: Bocachica (Small Mouth) in the south, and Bocagrande (Big Mouth) in the north. Cartagena is located at 10\u00b025' North, 75\u00b032' West (10.41667, \u221275.5333).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\n\n==== Northern area ====\nIn this area is the Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez International Airport, located in the neighborhood of Crespo, ten minutes' drive from downtown or the old part of the city and fifteen minutes away from the modern area.

Bocagrande has long beaches and much commercial activity is found along Avenida San Mart\u00edn (Saint Martin Avenue).The beaches of Bocagrande, lying along the northern shore, are made of volcanic sand, which is slightly grayish in color.

In the center of the bay is a statue of the Virgin Mary. The Naval Base is also located in Bocagrande, looking at the Bay.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCartagena features a tropical wet and dry climate.

In 1586, was commissioned to the most famous military engineer of the Crown of Spain in that time, the Italian Battista Antonelli, the fortification of the city. The works of the project finally ended in the 17th century; Cartagena became an impregnable bastion, which successfully resisted the attacks of Baron Pontis to 1697. In the 18th century, new additions gave the fortified complex its current amplitude by engineer Antonio de Ar\u00e9valo. The initial fortification system includes only the urban recint, the bastion port of San Mat\u00edas at the entrance to the passage of Bocagrande, and the Tower of San Felipe del Boquer\u00f3n that controlled the Bay of las \u00c1nimas. Gradually, all passages were dominated by fortresses: fortress of San Luis, fortress of San Jos\u00e9 and fortress of San Fernando in Bocachica, fortress of San Rafa\u00e9l and fortress of Santa B\u00e1rbara in Pochachica (the passage at southwest), fortress of Santa Cruz, fortress of San Juan de Manzanillo and fortress of San Sebasi de Pastellilo around the interior of Bah\u00eda, castle of San Felipe de Barajas, in the rock that dominates the city from the east and access to protected the Isthmus del Cerebro.

The area of Getseman\u00ed just outside the wall is also a popular place for small hotels and hostels.The following are tourist sites that are outside the city of Cartagena:\n\nLas Islas del Rosario: These island are one of Colombia\u00b4s most important national parks. Most of the island can be reached in an hour or less from de city docks.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAs the commercial and touristic hub of the country, the city has many transportation facilities, particularly in the seaport, air, and fluvial areas.In 2003, the city started building Transcaribe, a mass transit system.

Taxis in the city perimeter do not have fare meters.The following roads are in the southeast portion of the city:\nRoad 25: Going through Turbaco and Arjona, and through the Montes de Mar\u00eda when a fork divides it continuing to Sincelejo as National 25 and finally ending in Medell\u00edn, and to the east to Valledupar as number 80.\nRoad 25 A: Going also to Sincelejo, but avoiding the mountains, connects with Road 25 in the forementioned city.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez International Airport, is the busiest airport in Colombia's Caribbean region and the fourth in passenger traffic in the country. The code of the airport is CTG, having flights to almost all airports in Colombia including Bogota's El Dorado International Airport. Excessive operational costs and easier connection travel and better prices had led to the shifting of the Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez's international connection passengers away from Bogota to the nearer Tocumen International Airport in Panama and Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba. Also more companies prefer to serve the Colombian market from Cartagena, due to better geographical and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n==== Sea ====\n\nThe open ports of the city are:\n\nPort Society of Cartagena.

After Colombian independence, the canal was abandoned. Increasing centralization left the city without resources to maintain it. The last important maintenance work was done in the 1950s during Laureano G\u00f3mez's administration. Some improvements were made by local authorities in the 1980s. This was discontinued because of legal objections from the central government that decreed that the \"maintenance\" of the canal did not fall under the jurisdiction of the local government. From then on, maintenance of the canal has been delayed, though it is still functional.Cartagenian political leaders have argued that this state of affairs might change with a return to pre-independence funding and tax system. Under such systems the canal would be maintained properly and even expanded, benefiting the national economy.\n\n\n=== Waste disposal ===\nCartagena is one of the few cities in the world with a submarine emissary inaugurated in 2013.

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports.

          "The \"Monumento Natural Cueva Los Tres Ojos\", also known as \"Parque Nacional Los Tres Ojos\", is probably the most visited attraction in Santo Domingo! The caves and lagoons were discovered about a hundred years ago and are really breathtaking! A winding staircase leads visitors",
          "A beautiful place to relax and spend time appreciating natures wonders. Need a place to cool down while you are in the city? This is the place. Refreshments and souvenirs available too.",
          "Went there on a tour with Pedro, He was the sweetest guide ever. Going up and down the steps all day is probably not easy. The caves are beyond unreal, so gorgeous! It is a must in Santo Domingo. Had we known about the fourth eye before organising the Santo Domingo tour we",
          "very neat place, easy to get to. Can drive there or take the city bus. Enter at the gate, then walk down staircase to see the first pool, then connected pools. you can touch the clear water and see fish in there. cool place to visit for an hour or two.",
          "The 3 Eyes National Park is a really nice spot to calm down a bit and enjoy the view of cristal clear water holes. Alltogether it is a pretty small park, therefor entry prices with 200 DRP are ok. The park is situated between two very busy streets, but there is almost no noise",
          "Cool place, especially if you managed to come here before or after all package tourists. Last (4th) lake is must visit. It is ,uch bigger than all the others. Also remember, that you can walk outside of caves. Doing so you can see 4th lake from the ground. Pay attention that air",
          "We arrived and were met by a guide who wanted 20 dollars to give us a tour. Reluctantly we agreed and went on a tour which turned out to be well worth the money. This is a must see. It is 3 pools that are submerged in a cave area. You can. Stick your feet in but no swimming is",
          "A fantastic half-day trip from the historic old town to a natural wonder. Best to do in the morning, when there are no crowds. Walk to Plaza Espana and take an Uber from there (this way you avoid the occasional traffic jam in the narrow streets). The park has steep",
          "3 Eyes Park is a very interesting natural feature in the heart of Santo Domingo. I consider it a must see. The underground cave has stairs to take you to each lake, so it is very safe if you are careful. Our Guide was very friendly and informative. Be sure to tip your guide",
          "We visited two times because the first time we weren't prepared to swim. There are several cenotes and you can swim in 3 of them.If you are staying at the Westin, admission is free with your room card and a shuttle is provided. The path is a somewhat of a tripping hazzard, not",
          "Such a cool place to visit. Worth going on the little boat across too. Parts of it feel like u are in a movie set. We were able to get a private tour loved it. Also worth going early in the morning to beat the crowds.",
          "This is a beautiful part of the Colonial Zone area, yet they do require you to have a tour guide (at least this is what I recall). Entrance fee is reasonable. If you are looking to see a few cenotes, enjoy this time. While you cannot swim in them, it's a nice leisurely walk for",
          "A gorgeous small park near the city center. Very scenic. A perfect short excursion and diversion from city life.",
          "Beautiful place. Amazing under ground lakes. There is reasonable entrance fee plus small fee for ferry taking you to see the fourth lake. Walking is easy by the stairs. There is clean toilet and small cafe in the area.",
          "Hidden right in the middle of the city, this park is tucked away and left in it's original state. First thing you'll notice are some stairs down that lead you to three lakes, each different in colour because of the minerals they contain. The water is crystal clear and you can",
          "Give yourself the chance to get to know this place. This is a 1-2 hr hike in Santo Domingo you could easily fit into your schedule going to or coming back from the resorts in La Romana or Punta Cana. You don\u2019t need to be particularly fit and the place is fairly accessible, but",
          "I loved walking underground to see the water. We walked around the park too. It is a very nice place in the city. We took a small bus from Juan Dolio to this location. It was worth the trip.",

          "This places is amazing! Great caves with beautiful lakes inside the caves. You shouldn't miss it when you visit Santo Domingo",
          "The underground caves here are spectacular. It is hot and quite humid, but the view is worth it. Really interesting how these caves exist right inside the city. Well worth the look! Note: You don't need to spend the $10-$20 for a \"guide\". Wikipedia works fine!",
          "The Leumi-3 Eyes Garden. A place created by an earthquake. Small lakes of different colors were created. The first - blue. The other is black (probably because of the lack of lighting, the sun's rays do not penetrate there). Third - the lake of women who used to bathe",
          "Our guide mentioned that parts of Jurassic Park were filmed here. Tranquil spot. We took a guide who filled in info as very little actual information on the place. Recommend paying the $.50 per person and taking the mini boat over one of the underground lakes to the other side.",
          "This is an amazing place. There are lots of stairs, and it's very humid, so be prepared. But what a spectacular place for a very short drive from Santo Domingo and very accessible. We walked it ourselves without a guide. Make sure to take the cave boat trip to the other side!",
          "The caves will catch your eyes and the colour of water will make you feel the warmth of it. You cannot touch the water but it\u2019s worth visiting to experience.",

          "If you like nature, the 3 Eyes National Park is an excellent place to visit. Is a beautiful place with stunning caves, green water and amazing view. From the beginning when you get to the park you feel like you are in a movie such as Pirates of the Caribbean, is so much beauty",

          "The caves are beautiful - incredible! However, the lady at the ticket booth is horrible. This was at least our 15th trip to the caves. We host groups of tourist. Same story EVERY TIME - the lady at the ticket booth is incredibly rude! She argued with me for 5 minutes on the fact",

          "Very pretty, definately take a boat ride which seemed very nice. Wear good shoes. We went with a tour company Geey Line and it was nice. They only take cash so be aware of that.",
          "Los Tres Ojos is absolutely beautiful! We learned so much about its history and enjoyed its breathtaking scenery. It is cheap to enter and is an amazing escape from the city. It will exceed your expectations.",
          "We were visiting the park the 3 eyes and the truth was that it was worth the time the girls enjoyed it very much, the guides are very attentive and after the Tour you can stay around the park",
          "It test your waking endurance because of the many steps between each site but also it\u2019s a great adventure within the city, full of nature and a different view",
          "There caves are very worth seeing. It\u2019s hot and no way around it. Make sure you have water with you and a camera. I would not use the guide I did it on my own in an hour. I went and walked around the lake too which is beautiful with good views. Definitely worth seeing. I did not",
          "You can go by yourself but you will not know what you are looking at. You need to hire one of the guides so that you get an explanation of how they were formed and why they are so interesting. Guides are not expensive especially if you go with your family. Uber from the JW",
          "Small national park with the titular three lakes in an open cave. Well marked, you do not need a guide",
          "This National Park is an oasis right off of a main highway and is beautiful. The lakes were used in scenes in 3 major movies: Tarzan, Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones. The lakes and man made Cenote are awe inspiring. Yes there are a lot of steps to climb, but trust me it\u2019s",
          "Beautiful park and nice caves too many steps though. The shop can get annoying with people pushing you to buy items.",
          "Very nice I enjoyed the beauty and seeing were history took place I did not enjoy being hassled by locals who wanted to charge 15 dollars to include 50 cent boat ride to tell me what I already researched. I told the gentleman my husband had the money and he was upstairs in the",
          "It is a very beautiful place, I recommend it to go in adventure, it is a humid place, I recommend comfortable clothes and good shoes.",
          "Well kept with guides that speak multiple languages. Lots of stairs but beautiful area and for 2 pesos you can ride a raft to another area on the other side of the cave.",
          "Below the surface of Santo Domingo is another world waiting to explore. A cave system that connects three eyes, or lakes, is easily managed with stairs and hand rails. At one point the path ends and workers haul you across on a raft. Beautiful and engaging. And of course the",
          "It is an impresive cave that once upon a time the roof colapse. It has three lakes i the inside. It is very beutyfull",
          "This place amazing. Hidden gem in the middle of the city, it\u2019s incredible the way nature try to survive. Must visit and see it yourself.",
          "I highly recommend this place, the visit takes about an hour and a half, and it is beautiful. Take the boat to Lago Zaramagullones, it's worth it, small paradise. I went with flip flops, just be careful because there're some steep steps and it can be a bit slippery. In Lago de",
          "I think Tres Ojos is like stepping down into Jurassic Park or Tarzan! You drive in off of a busy highway and climb down steps into a whole different world of beauty. There are amazing trees and vines and pools of turquoise blue water. It is so worth the 2 hours you will spend",
          "It one of the things that you can do differently in the city of Santo Domingo. It average maintained and honestly, not that special to look at or be really impressed about. It\u2019s a good thing to do if you have like one hour to kill and can\u2019t think of anything else to do.",
          "Great hour walk around the work with some beautiful scenery. Would recommend as something to do for a morning or afternoon.",
          "Beautiful caves, close to the city. We toured the caves and found them to be beautiful and relaxing. The park is nicely maintained and well worth the trip to see it.",
          "Los tres Ojos National Park is well worth the visit Take a taxi and have them wait for you and arrange a tour. 3 lakes. You actually get to cross one of them on a hand pulled ferry. There were lots of school children on the Friday we were there. We had fun trying to talk to",
          "You don't need to pay for tour. It is okay to walk the area by yourself. If you want to know more about the park a guided tour may work for you.",
          "Three Eyes is a cool park to explore the caves and cenotes that are in Santo Domingo. Getting there from the city was about 30-40 minutes from Piantini with traffic and all. It was something that's cool to check out and it doesn't take up a lot of time. If you have mobility",
          "I traveled into Santo Domingo with a group of high school students, and one of our stops was Los Tres Ojos. It was advertised as a cave exploration 'on the way back to our hotel'. I was surprised when we pulled off of a busy road into a parking lot that was still well within the",
          "Yes, GO!!!! Yes, all you will say and hear is WOWWWWW!!!! YES, the $25.00 pesos is WELL WORTH THE BOAT RIDE! THIS IS A MUST SEE and no age will be disappointed! Lots of stairs but they have benches and landings for you to rest.... Entrance is $200 pesos! I took a uber for",
          "When you get to Tres Ojos you won't believe what awaits below ground. It cost us 100 pesos to enter. Beautiful caves filled with the bluest waters. There is a short boat ride (pulled across by 2 men by ropes) to bring you to the final cave, take the boat over at 25 pesos",
          "Went there for about an hour in the afternoon - but could've easily spent another 2 hours. The natural formations are of incredible colors and shapes, especially the second one, which you cross aboard a little raft, manually operated by locals. If you have issues with stairs or",
          "We did this as part of an tour ,we were in a group, we descended into a cave via stairs and it had guard rails ,the first cave was extremely beautiful, the water in the pool was a breathtakingly blue ,we were then shown zemes, carvings of stone that the Indians used to worship",
          "Entrance fee is 250 pesos per person and riding a little boat which takes you to 4th lake is 25 pesos per person. When you get there local guides will follow and buy you. Don't take the deal. You can just walk and follow signs by yourself. Thankfully we didn't have a guide. It",
          "Good stop on route to Santa Domingo. Not rec. for someone who has trouble with steps (up and down). I opted to look down at the sites rather than to walk down all the steps to only have to walk back up. There were older people who just sat and waited for the tour group to",
          "This was an amazing site that goes deep down in the earth but is not at all claustrophobic-inducing. It is very open and the pools are beautiful, clear blue/green Caribbean colours. They have tried to preserve/restore some of the hieroglyphs and there are railings everywhere",
          "Well worth it and beautiful ! Just didn\u2019t like being approached more than once and being asked would we like a tour guide. We answered no , but continued to follow us and didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer. We did not use a tour guide.",
          "Beautiful under ground park (limited surface park) very much worth the short ride from colonial town. Taking the underground float was part of the experience. Downside. Police told me it was unsafe to walk anywhere outside the park grounds.",
          "The 3 Eyes NP is something that I can recommend to visit when in Santo Domingo. Special part of the experience is to take somekind of wooden pontoon boat which will take you on the other side of the lake where you can see another lake and some native carvings. Very good",
          "We ventured out on Friday with the tour guide for the colonial town however, we made him take us to the caves even though he was pressing us about time and I am glad we did because it was an amazing place. Make sure you wear sneakers. Sandals may not protect your feet because of",
          "These beautiful natural pools surrounded by stalactites, nature and in the heart of the city is worth every peso to visit.",
          "I would not have believed such a beautiful place could exist in a metropolitan area. The scenery of these three underground lakes will blow your mind. Well worth the $4 entrance fee and $.50 ferry fee to cross one of the underground lakes. Note, not suitable for people who",
          "No, you have not died and gone to Heaven. You are standing in the middle of a big Caribbean city and major tourist destination and all of it is for real. The landscapers have superbly set out a series of interconnecting stairways and paths to lead you from one vista to another.",
          "We took an Uber to visit the park and it was only one of a few attractions we were able to see in Santo Domingo due to our schedule. While at the park, we hired a guide, Esteban, for $20US for the two of us after initially decided not to. I am glad I changed my mind to get a",
          "Don\u2019t wear too many layers of clothing and wear comfortable shoes. Our guide Nicholas was very knowledgeable and patient, told us a lot of history about the four lakes and was our very own photographer. It\u2019s something to experience here in Santo Domingo",
          "Like others reviewers I skipped getting a guide - just be sure to keep 25 pesos per person for the short boat ride, it\u2019s worth it. The caves are magnificent and the entire area is very peaceful. It is easy to get to via Uber (15 minutes from the city center) and the modest",
          "One of Santo Domingo\u2019s famous destinations is the Cave of the Three Eyes (Los Tres Ojos), a limestone cave with three lakes (fresh water lagoons). To reach the lakes, you have to walk down a somewhat long, precarious stairs cut in the side of the cave. It is not for those who",
          "Only 15 minutes away from colonial zone via Uber. Entry costs 200 pesos ($4USD) at the door, and 25 pesos (50 cents USD) for the cave boat ride. Skip the \"tour guide\" offers, which were anywhere between 500-1,000 pesos per person. The sights were breathtaking, and you can see",
          "Tranquility in the midst of a bustling city, very beautiful subterranean ponds with crystal clear water, I recommend visiting this national park!",
          "the park is a bit far from old town and the price of $4 is a bit expensive. the scenary is pretty good but not outstanding. Extra money to be paid in order to visit the 4th lake",
          "This was our fav park. Its Its beautifully maintained. We had an awesome guide. They close around 4:30 pm. There are alot of stairs so be ready to climb. There are actually 4 lagoons so make sure you get to see all of them. There are two views to see them from top and also at",
          "Great place to visit on a sunny day and take a guided tour to hear the stories behind these three lakes underground. Must cross the river to see the most deep one. Need to take a small boat. Enjoy it",
          "We had a great time here, we were able to see the honey and the bee hives here as well. The water was so cold I couldn't believe it. Make sure you bring your walking shoes, alot of stairs to climb",
          "It\u2019s hard to believe this place is in the middle of such a busy city. Once you go down the stairs you\u2019re transported to a tranquil underground world. It was really beautiful. Be prepared to go up and down stairs and to sweat a lot. Even though they\u2019re caves it was quite humid",
          "Found this wonder by accident while serving in the US Army during Operation Power Pack which was a joint operation of South American and Central Americans to quell an attempted revolution in the Dominican Republic.. When I was there we had free run of this beautiful sink hole.",
          "This is such a beautiful place. The cave is so eccentric. The lagoon is crystal clear blue and just so interesting to see how something so beautiful can exist below ground.",
          "Near Columbus Lighthouse (Faro a Col\u00f3n). It is said that three hours is minimum here. You can do it in one hour or less if you refuse the local guides attacking near the entry and refuse the boat trip (30 min). You can have this adventure by yourself. Prepare to have good boots",
          "If you have the chance to go, do it. It's somewhat otherworldly. Very soothing. Very close to the colonial zone. A 300 peso taxi ride, but you can also go there with public transportation.",
          "We were advised by a local to visit Tres Ojos National Park and we\u2019re not disappointed. If you love nature, then this should be on your list of sites to visit. The last lagoon is simply breathtaking.After a short boat ride on what the guide described as the Dominican Titantic,",
          "Nice experience. I definitely reccomend it if you're visiting santo. Very cheap 4 USD. There is a guy claiming he's a tour guida that doesn't collect salary. Dont fall for it. He is just trying to make an extra buck.",
          "A must see!!!! Words cannot do this park justice. Go in the morning time if you can because that is when the sunlight comes into the caves the most. When the sun hits the lakes, they look like they are glowing!",
          "There is some beautiful scenery especially when you get on the boat that takes you a.l private spot. Short tour so if you\u2019re looking to really explore or go hiking this is not the spot. If you want to take some great photos and videos that would be during the boat ride part.",
          "This place is great to visit if you have 2 hours free, it\u2019s cheap $ 4 USD per person if you aren\u2019t dominican, parking is available at no extra cost ( even though people might come up to you and ask for a donation for watching over your car) you can either go in and explore on",
          "There are two things to tell the Caves and the Guides. Google the caves and the history and you won't need a guide. They want a lot of money $20-$30 US depending on how much they think you can afford for very little information/history. There are four points of interest and the",
          "When you first get their and walk down into the cave you will be amazed...really neat experience. Be sure to take the boat across the lake and see the rest of the caves. We paid a tour guide $30 USD (1,500 Peso's) including our entrance fees and it was well worth it. He was",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Short trip from Santo Domingo! Fantastic pictures !!! Oh - and a ride you can not find anywhere else !",
          "It was an easy drive from the hotel we stayed at ,the Sheraton, with only a 20 minute drive. Free parking and plenty of parking spots. A little hard to find and in the middle of a city neighborhood. After you enter through the main gate, just take steps down to this natural",
          "This park is very close to the Colonial Zone where we stayed. It's right in the middle of everything so it seems impossible that this lovely gem could be hidden where it is. The third pool of Tres Ojos closes about an hour before the park closes, so make sure to get there",
          "It was amazing what we could see with our eyes that day, something fantastic, we were speechless!! The 3 Eyes National Park is the best! you can't not go there....",
          "It's 200 peso each to enter. We got a tour guide for 1000 peso between two people. He was very nice and took lots of photos but really he isn't needed. Don't attempt to walk home or the cestur will follow you as they think you're crazy for even attempting this.",
          "It is a beautiful place to visit. The staff was a little pushy about tips, though. Overall, I was glad I got to see it.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit to Three Eyes National Park. There are a lot of vendors/taxi drivers waiting outside the entrance, and a number of guides that will try to push their services on you. Say no to all of that and go explore the park for yourself. If you take the time to",
          "It is a perfect place to be relaxed. Nice enviroment and good to stay with the family. We enyojed our visit.",
          "Very nice park in Santo Domingo. I would never have realized it existed until I entered the gates. Clean, Professionally run park with underground lakes, caves and beautiful walking trail. Food is available.",
          "My dad and brother were visiting and, unfortunately, it was raining for an entire day of their trip. It can be difficult to find places to go or things to do in the DR when it's raining, but this is a good outdoor activity even when water is falling from the sky. Most of it is",
          "Beautiful place to visit if you love nature and caves. Bring some bred to feed fish, turtles and ducks.",
          "Beautiful caves and waters. I only wish that the park was better taken care of. There is some litter here and there. Be aware of aggressive vendors on the exit from the park. Entrance is about $5USD.",
          "such a great experience , a hidden treasure in the capitals concrete jungle , alot ot stairs so prepare yourself beforehand with proper footwear bathroom breaks and hydration",
          "Very clean , nice view , we really enjoy it , amazing the water was cold but fresh , the cave it was amazing",
          "When I saw this on Trip Advisor I knew it had to be on my Santo Domingo Bucket List. I was not disappointed at all. Our guide was fantastico and very informative. He also gave us the choice of Spanish or English. It\u2019s not handicapped friendly, but if you\u2019re ok with staying up",
          "I loved going to Tres Ojos, it was beautiful to see the caves and it was not crowded at all, maybe because it was Sunday. I really recommend this activity!",
          "Nice water, feels very fresh and beautiful colors It's nice to visit, takes about 1h to see all. Almost in the middle of the city",
          "I made that reference when we crossed one of the pools. No one got it. My young guide (luxury--I was the only one who signed up for the tour) did. He was very bright, well educated, and mature for a 20 year old. The site was part of a city tour, and by the time we arrived I",
          "Highly recommended to visit this attraction. It is very interesting to see 3 lakes inside the cave. You would want a guide to explain to you the origin of the lakes.",
          "It was a great change of ambiance for people that already live in the city, alot of walking, it looks amazing, You have to pay Extra to see the best view",
          "If you visit DR, Los Tres Ojos is a must! It looks so out of place finding this Natural Wonder within Santo Domingo city limits...but it looked good. Just beware about vendors and \"tour guides\", way overpriced. Still cool place to visit...enjoy!",
          "Great geological formations and wildlife. Be prepared for some stairs and skip the tourist trap vendors on the way out!",
          "I was amazed by this place and I decided to have my wedding photos taKen there. The entrance is 100 pesos, so it's kind of cheap. And you feel you're in a fairy place.",
          "Beautiful ! Many years ago was the local water source! Not far from the National Aquarium . Do both the same day!",
          "Whilst you won\u2019t spend lots of time there - roughly an hour - it\u2019s worth a look and definitely pay the 25DOP to take the boat across to the other lake - it\u2019s the most spectacular. We took an Uber - 140 on the way there and 210 on the way back due to traffic from the colonial",
          "Los 3 Ojos (the 3 eyes) are 3 open air underground caves with lakes. It's open to the public from 9 to 5. It's an interesting adventure and you can take great pictures in there. By the way, there are many stairs and it's not accessible for people on wheelchair and not",
          "The site is another must see during your visit to Santo Domingo. Just seeing the beauty of these under ground caves and lakes were breathtaking. I enjoyed every minute of this tour. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and it was interested to get to know more about these",
          "We popped in to visit this place on our way to Boca Chica. It\u2019s well worth a visit the caves are very impressive and there is lots of security so you will feel safe parking.",
          "it has very nice small lakes. Very small territory, no guide needed (and still nothing spacial to tell about). I think the best I have seen in SD. Be carefful in the local cafeteria, the worker gives wrong change and the prices 4 times higher than in supermarket, so better to",
          "very nice, can get some beautiful photos here. lots of stairs!!!!!!! you should wear sneakers to do this.",
          "Seriously, I have seen a lot of caves around the world, but this place is gorgeous and mysterious and so worth it - and so close to the center of Santo Domingo! Try to get there early on the weekend, to have the place to yourself, and don't forget to walk around the park area",
          "It is a real miracle how the nature created this. Four hidden underground lakes with unique subculture. Must visit this place",
          "I went with my parents for a day out. We really enjoyed it. The best thing about it for me, it took me totally by surprise. I drove past this place so many times, but never cared to check it out. Really good experience, I definitely recommend it!",
          "Really worth a visit! You don't need a guide. But take the small boat to the last lake. It's amazing!",
          "Don't miss this marvel of nature in the city. The first three caves were wonderful but the fourth was the best for me! Take the short boat ride to see it. At 25 cents, it's a bargain and you will not be disappointed!",
          "Tres Ojos is just 10 minutes by taxi from the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo. Uber would have been cheaper, but we took a taxi from the Colonial Zone and had the driver wait for us while we toured the caves - $25 for taxi ride. It was 200 pesos per person for admission. It",
          "This was breathtakingly beautiful and our guide was funny and knowledgeable!! You can take a boat ride across the water for an extra cost. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and clothing, it can be quite humid inside the cave.",
          "The park is known as Tres Ojos (Spanish for 3 eyes). It is a beautiful place to visit and a little boat/ cart takes you from the one eye to the other. I personally don't think it is necessary to use the tour operators available there because they just talk non-stop and you",
          "Definitely worth to see. Especially if you love beautiful nature spots. Hidden underground oasis in the middle of a big city, with lakes, caves and some flora surrounding the last lake. For me it was the nicest place I have visited in Santo Domingo. Some practical information:",
          "If your looking for something to do while in the city, you have to visit this park. The caves and under ground lakes show you how amazing nature is. Didn't require a tourist guide since I had a local friend. But a tour guide is recommended if your not from the country.",
          "I've been to many caves in the US, but these are still worth seeing. The caves themselves are not unique, but the deep blue water and tropical landscape make them very different. The short boat trip across the lake is worth the minimal time and cost - don't let your tour",
          "Looking down from the top it is hard to see why the big deal but go down there when the sun is out and it is stunning as the sun lights up the pools. You need to be reasonably nimble as you are going up and down unpaved paths all the time.Best bit? The raft!",
          "This is a nice place to visit. The guides are knowledgeable and tell the whole story as to how this cave was discovered.",
          "A jewel of nature in the city! Really beautiful place with grottos and lagoons. Lots of stairs that can be slippery when it's raining. Beautiful scenery. Enjoyable for nature lovers.",
          "Nice little day out with something different to do The caves were lovely and great for Pictures - however they really do haggle you for more money for tours etc when you can really walk it all yourself Can get quite exhausting walking around in the heat so grab some water!",
          "Very beautiful nice caves. It worth going. Just be aware when you leave the place. The venders can be very pushy. The get mad if you don\u2019t buy anything. They even calculate the prices for you in US dollars and euros. And the will push you to buy stuff and take you to a atm",
          "I have been to many caves in many places but the 3 Eyes is especially noteworthy. It is a very peaceful place with knowledgeable guides (we had Domingo). The integration of the walkways and steps using the indigenous materials was done very well and makes the experience",
          "We visited in July 2017 and stopped here on our way up to our vacation rental in Saman\u00e1 province on the opposite (North) side of the country. It was probably my fourth time visiting this place, but it opened up a lot (due to earthquakes) from when I went as a child, so things",
          "This park is beautiful. We spent a couple hours there. We didn\u2019t get a tour, but I don\u2019t regret just exploring on our own and doing our own research.",
          "Breathtaking caves. The short \"boat\" trip inside one of the caves and the scenery after that are a must. Foreign tourist pay double price and this is not stated on the cash desk. However, you receive a bracelet stating that you are a foreigner and the price (200 pesos).",
          "They have guided tours very affordable , they know their history for the caverns. Water is so clear . A must see place in santo domingo. Family friendly and a nice place to relax and enjoy nature.",
          "3 Eyes National Park was truly amazing! Well worth it to stop by and see! If you want a tour, guides are available. We did not use one and still found the experience truly special. We paid for the raft boat, which was well worth it!",
          "what a place, go there early in the morning, it is cooler, and there are less visitors. It is a lot of walking around, bring your tennis shoes.",
          "Wonderful tour! There is a snack bar and restrooms at the beginning of the tour. There is a large parking lot. To get down into the cave there are several steep stairs. Comfy shoes are a must! The guide explains many interesting facts about the cave, including that it was",
          "Very worth the stop and price of admission! Also clean and well kept, a nice contrast to the surrounding area. Follow others advice and skip the tour guide.",
          "It will take a couple of hours but walking in the caves was suggestive, the water is crystal clear and blue and you can watch it for hours. If you take bread with you you can feed the fish in the last lake!!!",
          "Great stop on the way to Santa Domingo. We taxied from Punta Cana. Caves are very cool. Avoid the guides you don't need them. They wanted $30US to walk with you through the park. Wear good walking shoes as it's a hike around the park and down the numerous stairs into the caves.",
          "We really enjoyed Domingo, our tour guide and seeing \"Tarzan\" the cliff climber and diver. Not sure I enjoyed getting bombarded by salesmen at the end in the gift shop.",
          "Skip the guide, enjoy the natural beauty. You can get here with Uber and pay the RD$200 entrance fee. The boat ride once you are in the park is only RD$25",
          "We visited Los Tres Ojos as part of an organized city tour. It was well worth the stop! We changed our plans to take the city tour in the morning rather than the afternoon. We we're glad we did as it was already a bit muggy. Keep in mind that there are a large number of",
          "It's the best in Santo Domingo. 3 beautiful in cave lakes. A bit of hard walk, stairs, but once on each site, you forget all the trouble to reach them. Very, very beautiful. As usual, they are going to offer you a tour guide at the entrance for 1,000.00 pesos (20.00 bucks). Not",
          "A nice place to visit! Have been here several times and it never gets old how awed I am with this piece of heaven,",
          "This a place to go when you want to wander around the city, but you want to do it in the most relaxing way. Beautiful caves with secret lakes, this is an amazing display of beauty from nature in the city.",
          "I really liked this park, although it is not a place to swim, water and caves are fantastically relaxing to spend a couple of hours. You're gonna love it!",
          "We like it nice cave. Don\u2019t think twice get a guide there is a fee but it will be fun. And they will tell you every thing you want to know regarding the cave. Don\u2019t remeber the name of our tour guide but he was awesome. He is on the picture.",
          "We took an Uber out here at about 9am. We were glad we went early as we had the place to ourselves until just before we left. Entry is 200 pesos, you definitely don\u2019t need a guide. The steps down are easy to navigate and the sink holes are beautiful, the light just shining",
          "If looking for something to do in the city, this place is highly recommended. A series of caves and groundwater. Nice escape to feel the Nature being in the city.",
          "We went to the 3 Eyes National Park and were surprised to see so few tourists there. The caves are beautiful and the entrance is reasonable (200 pesos/person). You can take a little pull-boat across to another cave for a small fee. Highly recommend!",
          "Beautiful location. Must see for your trip to Santo Domingo. Once you pay there will be local guides that will charge about $20 USD for a tour of the park. Good to do if you are interested in the history. Must take the mini boat for the 4th \"eye\". It is a beautiful location",
          "I love it. January is perfect time, it is humid and hot but imagine in July-August! Take care and wear not slide sneakers. The place is amazimg.",
          "This was a great stop on our day trip from Punta Cana. Our tour did Not have it on the agenda, but I asked for it and we did it after seeing the city. Cost is $5 or 200 pesos (which is less than $5 if you have pesos). The stairs are a bit steep, but there is a railing so anyone",
          "We enjoyed our experience exploring the underground caves & lakes. Lots of steps to get there and back up but it was worth it!",
          "The weather is great in Jan. This is a must see place if you are in Santo Domingo. We took Uber Fri colonial area to 3 eyes for 200 pesos. I particularly liked the first lake. The combination of trees, water colour and rock formation is picture perfect. The cafe is very basic.",
          "A great place to visit in the city. Not to be missed if visiting Santo Domingo. The restaurant could have been more updated as the things sold was very limited.",
          "It\u00b4s beutifull, if you like nature, amazing how this can be in the middle of the city, it has a little boat pulled by ropes, you have to take this ride",
          "If you're looking for seeing rare and beautiful things and places in this tropical island, this one is a must. You'll see two beautiful lakes/ponds with turquoise waters, and in one of them you can even take a boat and reach the third one, who is the most amazing of all. Believe",
          "This is not for small children or the elderly. Lots of stairs to get down there, but once you do it's like nothing you have ever saw. Take the raft ride through the cave to the last hidden pool. Tip the gentleman for crackers to feed the fish. Souvenirs outside are beautiful but",
          "awesome underground lakes and caves. make sure to take the underground boat trip to the 4th lake. most beautiful place in the world.",
          "This is a set of 4 small natural water holes with the most clean/clear water. Entrance fee is only 100 pesos each, and there is a snack bar and restrooms at the top. You then descend down some stairs to underground caverns which are actually open to the sky. The pools are of",
          "Great, unexpected trip to 3 Eyes, thanks to Greyline Tours. Thanks to our Tour Guide and Driver for a fun trip!",
          "First, I don't even like caves. It was a very nice place to visit. The day we were there they were getting ready to film a documentary. Watching them get a canoe down to the lake was worth the trip.",
          "Beautiful attraction just outside the city. We spent 2-3 hours walking around looks at all the pool and it was really quiet, so we saw quite a few birds and small animals running around. We didn't get a tour guide and it was no issue - used uber to get there and found a taxi",
          "We went to the park without tour guide. The ticket are cheap. They eyes water are astonishing and marvelous. They are a jewelry in the city of Santo Domingo. You have to take the boat ride, is cheap too and you can take the most beautiful pictures. Be prepare to walk and use a",
          "A hidden treasure not far from the city centre! An escape from the heat and I think used in Jurassic park films, a smashing little place of stalactites and stalagmites that look beautiful! Taking thousands of years to form contemplating the formation is mind boggling! Well",
          "Visited this park back in 10/17. The weather that day was in the mid 80's and very humid. Decided to go because the pictures we saw online were beautiful. We ubered to the park from our hotel and it was pretty cheap. Around $4 US. There were multiple people in thr front selling",
          "This is a great half-day trip from Santo Domingo. Our Uber driver had a very hard time finding it but we got there eventually and it was lovely. Be prepared to go up and down many staircases to see the gorgeous colors of the 4 pools. You can also take a short boat ride, it's fun",
          "This is a beautiful park with incredible grounds and sparkling clear blue natural waters. The caves are fantastic, the water tranquil, and the trees strong and lush. This is a must place to visit!",
          "Hidden in the city and worth the trip. We spent ~ 2 hours exploring with our kids ranging from teens to 6 years old. The pictures are fantastic but you must experience this to truly appreciate. The cost is incredibly cheap. We went without a guide and enjoyed but can see the",
          "The 3 eyes is a amazing place with natural park that is worthy to go and is very cheap, wear confortable shoes and is very hot but is worderfull",
          "Driving in Santo Domingo is a nightmare, but this is a short Uber ride across the river. It's a pretty basic park at first look, but then you go down a spiral staircase and get a WOW factor. We only spent about an 45-60 minutes there, so it's not a big deal to make a whole day",
          "Beautiful place. There is four lakes but we only got to see 3. We were able to take a guided tour in about 1 hour. Only complaint is that the bathrooms were dirty and the people trying to sell you crafts on the way out that get pretty annoying. They had nice stuff but just",
          "It only took us 1 hour to see almost everything and have tons of photography of the caves and lakes. So, tourists can squeeze it right in the middle of their daily plans. It is indeed beautiful tho.",
          "We got an Uber from Zona Colonial area, very cheap and efficient. Paid 100 Dominican pesos each entry fee to the park, politely refused the guides and walked a few metres to the steps down in to the cave area. These have a sign at the top and there are hand rails and proper",
          "Love Dominican republic the land and oceans everything about it is amazing i have been there 3 times",
          "It is a really cool place. They will not tell you where the entrance to the ojos are unless you buy a guide. The guide was nice and informative, but was he worth 20 US? ALso, after the tour, the military guide watched me sit in the park the whole time. Very disturbing..it could",
          "The park lies in a cave and is very big . is very nice and can cross the river with boat by pulling on a rope.",
          "I visited this cave while my weekend stay in Santo Domingo, this is a must see and if you have the opportunity to jump into this natural & clear water that would be great, and people say that swimming in that natural water will make you feel and look a little bit younger.",
          "Los tres ojos is the perfect place to fill one's lungs with fresh air while exploring Santo Domingo. If you're tired of walking around the zona colonial or the city in general, grab a taxi and spend half a day there. My favorite lagoon is the one that can only be accessed by",
          "It was really nice place, beautiful park all around but inside the cave it was out of this world. it felt funny at first going down inside not knowing what you were going to see. For anyone who like nature at its best well worth it.",
          "Ojos Los Tres is the name given to caves in the Mirador del Este park. A series of three lakes, or Ojos, the site is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. The caves are open from 09:00 to 17:00 and are lit at night by a huge number of colored lights.",
          "Really cool caves, amazing water and limestone. So cheap! 200pesos for 2 of us. That's like 2 dollars each. We were there for around an hour and took the little boat (floating platform pulled along by a rope)to the 4th lagoon- without doubt the best cave. Only 25 pesos extra",
          "This is a nice park to visit with family or on a date. Please beware that the stairs leading down to the cave are a bit dangerous so make sure you were the appropriate attire for this park. Great experience",
          "This place is amazing for the family. It is an unforgettable sight of different underground lakes. This place is well known to the local tourist and there are many local arts and craft to purchase on the way out. The price is not bad at all.",

          "This was an interest series of four caves and pools that are worth a visit. The place is reasonably well developed although the steps down are not that good but OK..",
          "The caves are nice to visit - though the humidity is oppressive. The steps leading to the caves and their lakes are slippery when wet. With the humidity they may always be wet. If you are careful, it is worth the trip down.",
          "The park is amazing! Exuberant nature, wonderful blue pools of water, a cave and a trail to walk around and contemplate this marvel. The visit won't take too long but it is totally worth it. It is located in the capital, it has good access and the entrance fee is not high.",

          "Definitely a must see if you are new to Santo Domingo. The environment is breath taking and lakes are amazing.",
          "We did not expect such a place to exist so close to Santo Domingo. It is very well preserved/taken care of. There are 4 \"ojos\" (lagoons)- the third and biggest one allows you to cross to the other side where the outdoor lagoon is for a 25 peso fee per person (worth it). What",
          "It's a fantastic place for taking photos beside water. Sun rays make water shine with a very nice turquoise color. It's a nice trip with kids, that includes a little \"sailing\" in a raft :)",
          "A natural beauty spot of Santo Domingo. It was 100 pesos to get in. It was 25 pesos to take the ferry through one cave to the fourth cenote. Definitely worth it. It's humid so be prepared to sweat.",
          "If you visit the city of Santo Domingo and love nature, a place that can\u2019t miss in your itinerary is the Three Eyes National Park, a cave with three lakes of fresh and crystalline water, and a fourth lake that is outdoors and can be seen from a viewpoint . It has a mysterious",

          "We visited the morning we were scheduled to leave the D.R. We stayed two hours and was able to see all of it except the subterranean boat ride. The walkways have railings and steps making it moderately easy to to climb in and out of the caverns. It was incredibly hot and",

          "The tour isn't very long but Tres Ojos is worth a visit. The lakes and caves were beautiful. Entry is 100 pesos but beware of the tour guides. I was approached by one guide who said the fee is $35 for a guided tour with explanation and the boat to go across to one of the lakes.",
          "I can strongly recommend this park! It's perfect either for adults or for children! It's practically very near to city center (Uber costs 140 RDS). Worth to see!",

          "I went to the National park with couple of fellow hostel dwellers and it was worth it. The enterance is around 100DOP (2\u20ac). The area is pretty small, that makes it wonderful place to go and have an easy 1,5h trip. Caves were cool, quite big with super clear water. I'd",
          "The reserve consists of three big water holes created by the collapse of a limestone rock. It is intresting but compared to other similar places it rather fair.",
          "really interesting and entertaining tourist site, well worth a visit...interesting geological park with underground caverns and caves",
          "What a beautiful place, right in the middle of the city, cool, lush, accessible...you dont need a guide and its a lovely way to spend half a day wandering around the caves and lakes........make sure you take the trip across on the little boat and then when you are done wander",
          "we stopped at the Park to see the tres ojos if you are familiar with the cenotes in Cancun, Mexico this is what they are. They are absolutely beautiful. this is a must see. The guide also pointed one of them if you have not had children it is said if you touch the water the",
          "Extraordinary place, very calm and beautiful. Nice to spend 1-2 hours walking around. Go with a guide if you want to learn about the place, or go by yourself if you just want to enjoy its beauty. Entrance is cheap ($2 and $0.50 for the 'boat' to the 4th lake, which is a",
          "A magic place, just minutes from the chaotic city life. A beautiful park where you can wonder an hour or two, enjoy the exotic flora and fauna. Also nice to see the \"Tarzan of Dominican Republic\", an elder man in great condition, climbing the cave's walls and jumping into the",
          "This is hands down one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I almost didn't go, and am so glad I ultimately did. Don't miss it!!! The park is a quick drive from the Colonial Zone-- 15 minutes at most. It's nice to see a different, less touristy side of Santo Domingo.",
          "Very relaxing. Beautiful. Romantic and great with family, couples or groups. Bring your camera. It only take 1 or 2 hours to visit.",
          "This is a nice place to go with family and friends, i were with my co-workers and enjoy all the view and get all the history information about the Tainos (The people the were by Christofer Columbus arrive the island) so enjoy the all walking throu the small lagoons.",
          "Is a hide place in the center of Santo Domingo, were you can find what mother nature can make for us to enjoy, after see this place you will be 1000% that we need to take our planet earth to.be enjoy for further generations.",
          "This outing is very near Santo Domingo, 30 minutes taxi drive. In an hour you could see the whole area. Worthwhile to go. There is one of the caves that you cross with a boat pulled by ropes, at the other end you can enjoy a fabulous cenote. Beautiful place to visit!!",
          "Just amazing. Definitely take the little boat to the 4th lake. Water is beautiful. It was hot but surprisingly not crowded at all.",
          "Stopped at Tres Ojos on our way to Santo Domingo and really wish we could have stayed longer. Such a unique and pretty ecological area!",
          "Natural park with caves close to the city town. It is worthwile, If you are in Santo Domingo, don\u00b4t miss it.",
          "We took a cab to this National Park and our cab actually waited for us for 2 hours. It was about $30 round trip to and from our hotel. It was lots and lots of stairs to walk but well worth the visit. Don't buy the \"guided tour\" that they try to sell you. It's only $2 to buy a",
          "Beautiful place, really worth the visit if you're into nature!!! I always bring my friends that visit from abroad and they really like going. It alaways amazes peple how such a beautiful place can be hidden in the city. You should take some bug reppelent with you, thought!!!",
          "I think it was the coolest and most beautiful thing we did in Dominican Republic. absolutely stunning! Worth visit!",
          "Fifteen minutes driving from Santo Domingo center city. It's worth to go, you can go down through the caverns and see the lagons. Impressive.",
          "Take the boat ride. Great site and would recommend this tour to anyone that enjoys culture. You will spend at least 2 hours at this location.",
          "It was not what I expected. The lakes in the caves are beautiful. When we went there was hardly anyone else here and it was so peaceful I could stay there all day. There are a lot of stairs, so be careful. There is also a small raft ride (25 Dominican Pesos) to another lake",
          "If you are in Santo Domingo this park is a MUST SEE! Well worth your time and the 100 pesos per person. There is a boat on one of the underground lakes that will take you to a beautiful cave on side of the main lagoon for 50 pesos more.",
          "The caves and water are beautiful! This is a once in a lifetime experience. The guides are also very knowledgeable, too. The only downside is after the tour there are local vendors who very aggressively try to sell you things. The experience is totally worth it, though!",
          "Inside Santo Domingo City. No more than 15 minutes by car from your hotel. Natural park. Easy to reach. 4 \"cenotes\" or \"water eyes\" discovered in 1914. You cannot swim but you can touch the water and take pictures of estalactites and estalagnites. A lot of stairs and 1 boat to",
          "When you get there, make sure to ask for Victor. The best guide you can have to explain in detail what you are looking at. It's an amazing wonder that nature was great in creating it. The water is crystal clear and different shades of blue. Then there's a lake that was used to",
          "Lots of stairs to climb down and up. It was beautiful inside. Worth visiting in Santo Domingo. It takes about 45 minutes to see the three lakes.",
          "At the entrance they will offer you a tour guide take it they will show you allot and you will feel very secure. Ours was Victor Emillio Abat was very nice guy and outgoing",
          "This was the best water experience and provided some very interesting facts. The water is so clear and very deceiving.",
          "I was a bit nervous when my friends said let's go to the caverns. this is a fascinating place. the steps are a bit ###. the lakes are small but the color of the water is like no other. They claim that \"Tarzan\" is real? I really liked the short boat ride. good time",
          "interesting place, close to the city. Apart from having to walk stairs, very accesible. The water is amazing, it is kept very clean and not expensive. Do not miss the last \"eye\" you have to take a small boat to get there.",
          "The park seems small from the trails up top - all of which are also gorgeous and allow you to sit and look out over the sunken lakes - but once you descend the stairs into the caverns below, you realize how massive and how breathtaking this place is. My friend and I scampered up",
          "high recommended. really wonderful place and we had a very nice time. have a look also to the 4th eye :)",
          "The colour of the water was amazing. We were shown the honey bee hives on the sides of the cavern walls. That was pretty neat. We were told that scenes from Jurassic Park were filmed there.",
          "This is a must see. I went without a guided tour. I really love to take pictures in this place. Sad thing is you mustn't swim here. If you cannot climb a lot of stairs then I don't recommend you to go.",
          "We only had about an hour and was unsure about visiting here but we are so glad that we did! It was beautiful and we could have stayed loads longer. It's worth going on the little boat to the last lake. I wasn't quite sure what to expect beforehand but I wasn't disappointed and",
          "This park is fascinating. It is literally a hole carved out in the ground with four beautiful lakes and a series of caves. I found the tour guide to be quite accomodating and informative. The reception area appears a bit lax. Too many people milling about.",
          "This National Park is a beautiful place. A \"cenote\" of sorts, the \"three eyes\" are smaller sink holes that house some absolutely beautiful water and history. We had a bilingual guide...I speak both Spanish and English, and couldn't understand EITHER of his languages...he was",
          "Santo Domingo is not an inexpensive place. This park is good value. US $2 to enter and about 50cent to Cross the water to the 4th pond. Really great park with crystal clear water, toilet facilities, cafe etc. Very nice walk and tranquil. We went Wednesday afternoon and it was",
          "The 3 eyes is a must on your trip on Dominican Republic, is the most amazing place located in the middle of the city, it's a walking down to the filtered water, amazing heritage of Mother Nature, clear water, the caves are with that special smell of being in a lost world!",
          "its well worth a visit natural wonder well organized clean facility beautiful attraction be physically fit to climb stairs but sooo worth it beautiful lakes and boat ride",
          "My husband & I visited the 3 eyes national park as part of a tour package from our hotel. We had a tour guide who told us lots of interesting facts as we were walking through. This place is a must see for anyone looking to visit Santo Domingo, it really is beautiful. The water",
          "This was a pleasant surprise, very beautiful and inexpensive. Steps were narrow and can be slippery as expected. Finding the man sitting on the edge reading a newspaper was shocking but comical. The water is crystal clear. We were confused about the tour guides as our Spanish",
          "This is a little gem people must see if they visit the DR. It's cheap and super quick. You can either walk on your own or pay a guide to show you through with a history lesson.",
          "Surrounded by a beautiful park these lakes are belong ground in semi open caves, a good number of steps but worth the trip down to see the rock worn away by the ocean. Worth spending a little bit more to go on the raft to see the final lake. Make sure you barter!",
          "Surrounded by a great park, Los Tres Ojos was quite the sight. A lot of stairs but worth the walk down to see the lakes created by the ocean washing away rock and forming these picturesque sights! Very low cost to look and to receive a guide. It was worth the extra bit of money",
          "So picture going down many steps into a cave, but the top of the cave caved in many years ago, so instead of a murky dark cave, you walk into a beautiful tropical stone garden. As you explore the cave you discover thee eyes of water (lakes), crystal clear turquoise water with",
          "Nice national park in Santo Domingo. In the caves is much cooler than the outside and the beautiful color of the lakes looks fantastic shining at the sunlight. Nevertheless there is a lot of tourists.",
          "nothing spectacular and not sure what all the fuss is about, nice park, cool looking cavern, but nothing that stand out or is particularly unique (if you want some impressive caverns, then check out Luray Caverns in Luray Virginia) anyway, if you're anyway here and have nothing",
          "We enjoyed visiting this park on our tour of Santo Domingo. It was beautiful and unique. I recommend using one of the local guides to give you a tour of this park",
          "The waters of the three pools have a beautiful color to them. The cave formations are interesting as well. It was very busy the day we went and we visited very quickly as part of an one day Santo Domingo tour. Would have been interesting to ride the boat.",
          "We were a group of six, two of which had poor mobility. We were in no rush and the guide allowed us to go as slow as we needed to accommodate mobility issues. It is a long way down to see the fourth lake, which is spectacular. It is also a very long way back up so plan",
          "Well worth the descent and even more aruoius ascent of the cave pools. Guides were knowledgable and good english. Convenient refreshment bar and toilets on exit.",
          "Go early to avoid crowds and lines at the \"boat\". The fourth lake (via the boat) is the most spectacular. If it's not crowded you will be in and out in about 40 minutes. When you come back out of the ground, you can follow a trail to see the 4th lake from above.",
          "Me and my boyfriend went to Los tres ojos on a monday morning, I recommend going early in the day, we had the hole place almost for ourselves! Its REALLY beautiful, and its best going on a sunny day (I guess the water is most blue then) the water is SO cristal clear and blue! It",
          "We had an awesome time in the park. We just paid 2$ and 25 cents for the \"boat\" to get to the other side. Even the bus ride from Santo Domingo was so much fun! I mean you have to wait till the bus is full and you never know where the bus is going to stop and how long it takes",
          "I was surprised to see how many people actually go to the park, specially foreigners. We had a great time! the views are awesome.",
          "As above an interesting tourist trap, you can only walk by the cenotes, no swimming. Tons of people around trying to make money, e.g. A guide offering his guiding for 25 min visit and charging 30$. Not worth paying that. Taxi drivers are offering a tour from the colonial zone -",
          "The 3 Eyes National Park is a miracle what you have to see! In my opinion it is a number one site to visit in Santo Domingo.",
          "This was undoubtedly the most surprising part of our day-long tour to Santo Domingo. When our bus pulled off the highway and circled through a tired, rough looking neighbourhood into a tiny parking lot, I wondered where the heck we were stopping. Even when you get off the bus",
          "I am glad that we saw this but it wasn't a must-see for our family. It may have just been that we were tired when we went.",
          "Very close to zona colonial, very cheap entrance, only 1 hour or 1 and a half to see, and very very very beautiful and interesting, a must see if you're in santo domingo.",
          "A 20 minute taxi ride from the Zona Colonial, this natural site is worth your time. Cheap, maybe 250 pesos (5-6 USD). I enjoyed the peace and natural beauty of the well kept natural park.",
          "This is a national park with 3 caves and a lagoon. It costs $100rd to get in, but I heard that next month it'll be something like $200rd for locals and $300rd for tourists. Many years ago (70s I think) it was just a swimming hole, but the gov took it and stopped people from",
          "This was an amazing trip, short and very close to the city, is very convenient, Don't walk here as I heard that neighborhood around it is not friendly!",
          "This place is worth checking out, especially since it is so cheap. You can take an Uber there from zona colonial (about 10 minutes). There were no crowds when we were there. The little boat/ferry ride inside the cave is fun. it was rainy when we were there, but still nice.",
          "Carstic site of underground river which due to natural circumstances formed 3-4 natural lakes , nice place with good site services. Prefer the week days and not the weekend as it is very popular.",
          "When we first arrived we were bombarded by people trying to sell us a tour. For $25USD they would take us to see the lakes. DONT fall for it. To get in is about $2 a person. The cave is so beautiful. Inside of the cave there is a boat that will take you through and out the other",
          "We had a guided tour to Santo Domingo and this small, but interesting national park was our first stop. And it was definitely worth visiting! There are there of these eyes or caves accessible by foot, and the fourth one by a small boat. We didn't do the fourth one, but saw the",
          "Lots of steps to go up and down but we'll worth it! A bonus stop on our tour. Alot of money has gone into preserving the caves and lakes .",
          "I visited this place as part of an all day tour including Santo Domingo. This is the first stop. it's really something beautiful worth visiting.",
          "3 Eyes is a series of caves and small lakes connecting to each other. Beautiful plants too. Several of the small ponds are a very beautiful blue color with clear water and you can see to the bottom. The largest lake has many fish and a pretty green color with plants hanging and",
          "Caves are interesting. Never know what you can see when you are there. The steps down are not daunting as it appears. It is an easy walk. The pools are magnificent. Rock formation always is interesting. The roots that extend to the ground makes one feel that you can climb up and",
          "We almost didn't cross the river thinking it wouldn't be much on the other side, what a mistake that would've been. This place is beautiful. Would completely recommend",
          "This place is beautiful, especially for people that like to be in the outdoors. The views are breath taking and its interesting that there are three outlets all different that is why it is called the \"The 3 Eyes\".I loved how the roots from the trees hang into the water to get",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit. There are steep stairs down descending into the cenote. You walk up and down paths to view the bottom. There are railings to help.The trees and plants growing inside are really cool. It is a short distance from the colonial zone. It might be",

          "An absolutely must see if in the area. My family paid for a guide to take us through which I don't recommend. We felt rushed and did not learn anything from him so we felt it was a waste of money. We also did the boat ride to the fourth lagoon which was worth it.",
          "Very interesting to see even if on your own. We took a tour guide with us from the Zona Colonial and he explained in detail the history of the area and what makes it special. You can cross through the water on a small transport raft to another more isolated lake for 50 pesos.",
          "Must see while in Santo Domingo, the tour guide was fun and professional, told us interesting facts about the cave",
          "This is a must see. Number one tip: skip the \"tour guide\" and go it alone. Bring water and be prepared to sweat down in the cave. Don't forget to walk top side as well. Beautiful.",
          "If you are in SD you must go! So close and only takes about 1-2 hours in total. Use a guild. so much more useful.",
          "Popped here for a short trip whilst on cruse. I wish I had gone earlier and made the most of this place. Watch out for guides who jump on you after entrance they will charge and you only need them if you want a fact tour. An odd place for this to be so best get a taxi and",
          "Right in the city, without having to travel far just 15 to 20 minutes there exists this much beauty, three natural pools in cave like environment that will definitely make an impression. Santo Domingo has so much to offer In tourists attractions.",
          "Interesting caves to visit with beautiful waters. The waters are three different types. When I was young people could swim in the waters, but now you can take a boat ride and look around.",
          "Is not far away from the city you can stop by on your way to the city or when going back to airport!! Is really cheap to entry... You go all the way under the ground, a lot humidity but what your eye will see is Worth it!!! 3 Crystal Waters eye holes amaizing!! Dont forget to",
          "This is a great park to visit for a couple of hours. The fee to enter is low but when you exit the park you will be mobbed to buy junk all the way to the vehicle.",
          "very educational loved it . make sure to wear comfy clothes its very hot and humid. alot of walking which makes for great exercise. also make sure to bring your camera we saw a few bats which was exciting in the cave.",
          "You probably drove right past this on the way from the airport. This is a nice short trip that takes less than half a day.",
          "A surprising and beautiful places that includes a \"cenote\" with 3 small lakes with wonderful coloured waters and a fourth nearby. The visit should be done in the morning when the light of the sun reach the bottom of the big hole.",
          "This is a breathtaking natural wonder! These caves are something else! I really really loved this awesome park!!!",
          "This is an REALLY Beautiful Natural Park. The drawback is that \"out\" of the city, and in order to go there you need to go by car, but if you have the opportunity to visit, you will not regret it. Stoning !! There is an entrance fee per person. Make sure you bring Local",
          "So for about 30$ you get a guided tour and its worth it. The views are amazing and the rivers are beautiful. Our tour guide Victor was amazing and funny! You are not allowed to get in the water but you can touch it. There is a little boat that takes you from the third lake to",
          "It is a beautiful place if you enjoy nature, nice, clear air, amazing to go with the family and/or as a couple.",
          "Rain or shine -- this is a very unique experience. Just a short ride from the Colonial Zone and in the heart of Santo Domingo, you can find an ancient cave deep in the ground that had been a home to the native Taino people and now a beautiful national treasure for the DR. Do",
          "This was a cute park with some walking trails and some wooden statues. They is also a stairway going into a cave with a fresh water lake. Very pretty and we enjoyed the hour we spent here.",
          "watch out for your money there stuff they sell is over prize bragand down or leave if to hi ya. so the fary is free and there is a cool pond o the other side.",
          "The tour guide was very knowledgeable, spoke english and was very accommodating took pictures of us too.",
          "Great place to visit. The pools are amazing (if only you could swim in them!). He greenery is amazing. Just a good beautiful thing to check out. Only word of warning is about taxis: taxis are very cheap as long as you agree in advance on the price. We thought we had, but when",
          "There are three lakes at this park. Although the park is not big but to access to the lake you will need to climb up and down many steep narrow stairs. This area swimming is not allowed. The underground water is so... clear and the rock formation is amazing. All lakes are at",
          "After reading the reviews we decided to visit. We opted for a guide, which included the fare for the boat ride to the lake.. well worth the visit and the guided tour.. an unassuming park, but delightful to visit.",
          "How can it be so humid in a cool cave so far underground? The first cave had a turtle swimming in it. The best cave was the one you had to get the raft to (25 pesos return). Great geology - limestone, stalagmites, stalactites with bats and then the most awesome vista as you",
          "A must visit when in Dominican Republic. Stunning views of caves , a hidden gem in the city of Santo Domingo. Easy to get around and inexpensive!",
          "When the tourist guide told us he is going to take us to 3 eye national park the first thing came to my mind was another park with trees and grass and some historic moment to it. But when we entered the park and we were told to step down and explore the place for our self and",
          "Worth the trip; wasn't really sure what to expect. Don't need a lot of time, but plan 30 to 45 minutes. Humid and lots of stairs if physical limitations. May feel a bit claustrophobic at times - easy to avoid",
          "We went on our own and didn't have a tour guide but really didn't need one. The walk was good exercise but make sure you wear shoes with non slip soles as the steps are very slippery in places. It cost us 100.00 DR pesos (less than $2.00) to go in.",
          "Definitely worth the short drive from the city to see. There are 4 bodies of water, although one is quite small. We took the little boat ride to the 4th, and it was the most beautiful in my opinion. We had lucky timing and pretty much at the place to ourselves which made the",
          "This is a lovely park with some nice paths for walking. Getting to the cenotes means a lot of steps up and down, many of which are quite steep, so I didn't attempt them. You can view the cenotes from above. There are somewhat primitive washrooms and a cantina on site as well as",
          "A pretty cheap activity that last about a hour or so. There are about 60 steep steps leading Down into the cave system. Which is the only access so if you have mobility issues I would advise against visiting. Once you've completed the steps down and peer around it's like your",
          "Nice, easy walk. Biggest cenotes I've seen. You can get down to the water pretty easily. Went with a tour group. Recommended. However, the merchants in the \"exiting area\" were tough to get through.",
          "Very special and beautiful place. Cheap entrance fee but don't take the guided tour that is offered to you when entering the park. It's a total rip off! 30 dollars for no valuable information what so ever. Better and more fun to look around on your own",
          "Small admission charge allows you to see one of natures most beautiful and interesting underwater cave system. Multiple scenes from Jurrasic Park were reportedly shot here.",
          "Its amazing to see what the earth can create. I heard of this place since I was little and visited when I was little but i didn't remember it. When i went now i saw how amazing it is. The rocks, water, how its formed. Its just beautiful.",
          "The park, which is very convenient on a trip to the Faro de Colon, is composed of four small lakes within a series of caves. The trip from the center city is about half an hour, but can be combine with the trip to El Faro and the colonial zone. It is \"nice\", but not worth a",
          "We went here just to checkout if it's interesting and it turned out to be much better than we expected! Beautiful underground lakes and we even met two turtles there. Pure water and nice place for some relax.",
          "Not much to se only takes no more than half hour. THen you have vendors trying to sell you artifacts overpriced.",
          "We arrived a few minutes after it opened which gave us good light and colours. I was amazed that it was in the middle of the city, and was still very nice. Didn't take very long to see it and we were hot by the end.",
          "As a student of geology and scuba diver of blue holes, was fascinated to explore this uplifted ancient reef. It is 230-some steps down and then a return back up, but at 75 years old, the trek was not an issue for me.",
          "We got an amazing TAXI driver (use What's App in DR to connect with locals 849-220-5673) who took us around town and also to see these amazing cave lakes. Pay the $20 USD for the local tour guide who brings the place alive with their stories. This is great for your travelers",
          "My husband, niece and I visited this attraction as part of a day trip tour from Punta Canta to Santo Domingo. The guide took us to the tres ojos but we did not see the entire park. Had this been an unlimited time tour on our own, we would have seen as much as possible. I love",
          "WE get there with not too much expectation but it is a really mind blowing place in Santo Domingo. If you like nature this is a must to do. Reminde that you will walk trough caves and humidity is quiete high. It is a experience you have to have in Santo Domingo.",
          "The place is basically three blue lagoons inside a cavern, where to get there you have go down using a huge rock stair. Once you get down, be prepare to be amaze by this beautiful and well kept spot. You can not swim there, it's against the law, but you will see water a blue",
          "These fur lakes are fformed fron the under w\u00e1ter running fron Los Haitises out Samana. Called the Three Eyes because only three of them do not look at the sunlight, the fourth has direct sunlight. All of themld as well have very blue cristal w\u00e1ter and very cold as well.",

          "If you have 3-4 hours and the capacity of climbing a hundred or so stair steps you should visit this gret wonder of mother nature - and find out about the blind eye... Especially great with children.",
          "You're probably going to have the place to yourself! Truly an urban oasis! Very close to downtown, and the Columbus lighthouse /museum /tomb.",
          "We liked this cave and it's crystal clear water. The steps are not really that difficult as you have few floors. You can take a boat trip down there if you have enough time. Please note that it's not allowed to swim over there.",
          "Nature is our best provider of beauty. This is a very different Pucture because we don't see it often. Three small lakes, called Eyes, with deep turquoise water due to minerals. Exhuberant folliage and way down many steps. One of the eyes is under rocks and stalactites. I",
          "This was an extraordinary adventure, the only bad observation that i can write is when you finish the trip, you cross like a store and the people is very annoying there but it was an excellent place!!!",
          "It was great. No need for tour guide just explore by yourselves. Really cheap, close to the city adventure. Really underrated not many people not even locals (as i used to be one of them) know about this paradise 5 mins away from the city",
          "This was our Most favorite part and location of the entire vacation. It is absolute splendor in photos, but once you see it in real life, you will never forget how enchanted you felt. The beautiful stone and forestry really takes you to a different time period. It feels like a",
          "Very pleasant experience. Cheap entry prices, and great photo ops. Takes about 15 minutes to walk through and see all 4 lakes. Pay the 25 pesos per person to take the boat to the 4th eye. Comes to less than a dollar and it is the prettiest of the 4 lakes",
          "How fascinating to have caves in the city!! There is a fee to entrace, but its worth it! There are actually 4 cave, the 4th one is actually the biggest one and most beautiful. Under the cave, it is very humid. So do bring some water.",
          "Must see attraction! These caves were amazing to see especially in the heart of Santo Domingo. Must be fit for those stairs.",
          "It is no longer possible to swim in the caves.but the visit is quite nice the worst part without a doubt is hyper souvenir vendors the visit is worte because the beuaty of the cave",
          "The 3 Eyes national park is really a site to see. It's interesting to think about how people lived in the past and where they gathered for shelter. This park is quite pretty and breathtaking. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes and bring your water with you. I suggest going on",
          "Beautiful introduction to the natural wonders of DR. Very close to the Capital, you can drive from the colonial district and its only 15 minutes drive. the entrance fee its only 100 pesos, VERY INEXPENSIVE! I love the river pools created and the mystical atmosphere created by",
          "we stopped here as part of a santo domingo city tour. this is not a senote, there is no swimming and seems like its in decline. however its very beautiful. our tour took around 20 mins. the third eye was inaccessable when we went. the guide said that bees had taken over and he",
          "I fell in LOVE with this place. I truly enjoyed every second I spend in the caves. It is absolutely beautiful and for me, It is a must do in Santo Domingo. There are A LOT of stairs, so be prepared to climb them, but it is totally worth it. The most beautiful lake is only",
          "Went for the 1st time here with my wife and it's absolutley breath taking. This is definetly a place where you would want to take your loved ones.",
          "Los Tres Ojos National Park is a small park amongst the suburbs of Santo Domingo. Despite the nearby sounds of traffic, it's easy to focus on the nature as it is simply gorgeous. There are four lakes/sink holes to visit, all with crystal clear waters amongst jungle like",
          "This place is absolutely beautiful, its also a good exercise climbing the stairs but it is more than worth the walk. This is a must do activity in Santo domingo.",
          "Very \u00ednteresting park. Good place to go if the idea is looping for a \u00ednteresting and beautiful park. Four amazing lakes. Very nice experience.",
          "Went as part of a tour from Punta Cana. It was my favorite part of the tour. Loved the 4th lake the best. The 3 eyes are beautiful, worth seeing!",
          "This is one of the most beautiful places of the Dominican Republic. The place is well maintained and clean. The entrance fee is $100 pesos and there is a lot of humidity, making you sweat a lot. Since there are a lot of stairs to go down, then up, you have to take your time in",
          "Interesting park, only 100 peso entry there are guides, but we did not get one. My 9 year old liked it to. Good for photography.",
          "Tres Ojos is basically a beautiful cave with underground lakes, and a secluded other lake which you can reach through the cave, it's magical! Don't book any tours, if you want it can be very cheap to go there! Take the OMSA bus on the big road near Palace Nacional, (near Zona",
          "Inexpensive and beautifully maintained grounds and caves. This was a great place to visit, and allowed us to escape the incredibly difficult noise and traffic of Santo Domingo. Parking was free, easily accessed, and supervised by park guards. Avoid the handicraft pavilion",
          "This place is so cool! If you are in Santo Domingo and enjoy the outdoors at all check it out. It is only 100 pesos per person to get in, but bring an extra 25 per person for a little cave boat ride. Lots of stairs but the cavern and the pools are breathtaking.",
          "the caves the colos of the water cause by sulfer are very impresive and i think is one of the preeties places i ever seen of natue",
          "These underground limestone caves are an amazing place, with four crystal clear lakes called \"ojos\". A must do when you visit Santo Domingo.",
          "This is a must see if you're in the area. It was absolutely beautiful. There are a lot of stairs to go up and down but it was totally worth it.",
          "It's really nice to appreciated the different color can take the water according its environment. You can find 4 lakes, each of one have their own charm. I like a lot the Azufre and las Damas or Women... The walk is pretty short although you have to walk through many stairs",
          "One of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. DO NOT waste money on paying for a tour guide... Do it on your own....they will bully you into paying $40",
          "You will not want to miss out on this tour if you don't plan on taking other cave tours while in the DR. The underground pools are fantasy-like. Don't pass up the little boat ride to the Hidden Lake.",
          "This was an amazing experience. They say the waters are curative and give you youth. If so the case, when I went back to work people told me I had a great glow and looked younger :) Its hummed but does wonders to your skin. So make sure u take ice water! If you buy things make",
          "It's a very beautiful place to visit. The employees were the worst. As we payed the entrance fee we were automatically introduced to a spokesperson who gave us great insight on all of the \u201ceyes\u201d. To watch the whole park, you need to pay an extra fee of 25 \u201cPesos\u201d ($1.00 = 45.00",
          "Tricky to get here because of the highway system in the country, but I was blown away with the beauty of this place. Even in 2016 and in the middle of the city, it looks like untouched earth. AMAZING!",
          "This place was cool. The waters were beautiful and the local guide at the large lake was informative and personable. If you're into jurassic park at all, you'll love it as they filmed part of the first movie at the big lake. Wear sneakers or sport sandals if you can. There",
          "This sit has a numerous stairs, little ones will be super tired on the first site to go down. Bottled water suggested, b/c there werent locals selling any. I took myself like an 1 to do the whole site and felt short. Health condition is a plus, to have a nice exercise outting.",
          "The three eyes is a place where you find natural beauty. Stalactites, stalagmites, waters eyes into beautiful caves. The eyes are beautiful. It worths the visit. It's a different place to visit in DR. You can't find this beauty everywhere. When you go, wear fresh clothes",
          "Arriving at the site I didn't have very high expectations but once I started to descend into the \"pit\" area, wow was I surprised! Amazing clear blue pools (3....obviously), interesting rocks/stalactites/stalagmites. In one pool you can take short floating pontoon across it to",
          "We went during a week day. No one was there. We only spent about an hour. There are 4 lakes. 3 inside caves and another that is mostly outside a cave. Lake 4. Pretty cool to see. Don't drive a long way just for this but certainly if you're in santo Domingo...go.",
          "Small place with small lakes and one big lake with beautiful trees surrounding it. Unfortunately, there was power cut where the lights did not work in one of the lake when we went. They should have a back up generator. Right next to the road , so we could use public transport",
          "Until now, this park is only cool area for me! Inside of the cave so good as the name of here. There are three eyes like a tiny lake!!! Do come!",
          "I have visited Los Tres Ojos three times and still am not tired of it. Most recently I took my two daughters. We stayed in the Zona Colonial of Santo Domingo and took a taxi here and back for $1,200 pesos, which was about $26 American dollars. This is not a bad rate considering",
          "Truly a must visit. If only we were allowed to swim. The place is beautiful. The \"boat\" ride to the other pool added to the experience. That pool was worth it!!!!",
          "This place is awesome. The caves are amazing, the natural formations and the most amazing thing is just right 15 minutes away from the city center. You will definitely want to bring your camera and maybe some sport shoes. The entrance is really cheap and you may or may not hire",
          "Went here after Santo Dominigo tour, was quite interesting, such a shame you cant go for a dip, but the Cenote in Mexico were much better and in the sheer heat a dip in the cold water is what is needed, not here though.",
          "Is nice to be among the nature, see the caves and the species that live in the natural lakes. Was nice",
          "This is a beautiful park that is practically untouched. We had a great time. Don't miss the small boat ride to the 4th lagoon. The 4th lagoon is actually the nicest and it is the opening scene of the Jurassic Park movies. Buy your ticket there not ahead. There are really cheap",
          "Absolutely breathtaking. The water is gorgeous, the raft over to lake 4 was so fun, and we enjoyed getting to see a true piece of Dominican History. We had an amazing tour guide who was kind enough to allow us to take as many pictures as we wanted-and we wanted to take as many",
          "I highly highly recommend this nature site. The caves are amazing, there's a lot of exercise required, up and down stairs, is extremely humid inside, but it is all worth it.",
          "I was able to visit that natural beauty name 3 eyes. A wonderful water cave. Like the guide said that was the place they gilm jurassic park... Well i like it and they give you all explanation regarding the story of that cave.",
          "We enjoyed the view and the guide was very funny! We did have to walk up and down many stairs so wear comfortable shoes.",
          "Lots of stairs. I don't recommend this for anyone not steady on their feet. While I enjoyed the site it was very hard navigating the many steps.",
          "I love going off the beaten path. On our vacation we found this spot on yelp and it was absolutely stunning.",
          "it is a really nice place to visit, it is located in Santo domingo close to downtown, is a natural cave with blue water, perfect for taking pictures, the only bad thing is the people outside selling handcraft stuffs that get really annoying, besides that , it is a really nice",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I love to explore these national treasures wherever we go. I am so glad we did not miss our opportunity to see these caves/caverns. Do not skip this if you are visiting Santo Domingo for any reason!",
          "We were pleasantly surprised to find such a neat experience right in the middle of Santo Domingo. There are guides there waiting, but we didn't feel like we missed out by not hiring one. Really beautiful caves and lagoons. Plan for about an hour to complete.",
          "We came from Punta Cana in our rental car and wish we had realized that the park was on our way to the hotel we could have easily stopped on our way into or out of the city. Instead we used a taxi from our hotel to get there. When we arrived we realized that we could have",
          "Los Tres Ojos is definitely worth visiting if you're in Santo Domingo. The caves are unique and it's nice to see natural beauty within the busy city. The entrance is 100 pesos and the boat ride in the cave is 25 pesos. There are guides available, but they over charge and it's",
          "I really enjoyed the visit to the park. I would recommend to pay for the private tour, as you get much more out of your visit than just going at it alone. An adventure for all ages, as long as you are not afraid of the natural steps to go up and down the route and the humidity.",
          "Did some exploring on a business trip and ended up at the Three Eyes. This place is beautiful and majestic. Spectacular piece of history.",
          "If you combine The 3 Eyes National Park with Faro a Colon or with Cuevas de las Maravillas it\u00b4s going to be a great, balance and worthy experience.",
          "We were surprised at how close this was within Santo Domingo. It is a beautiful place to visit. Our guide spoke English and Spanish. Lots of stairs to climb, but nothing strenuous.",
          "I've never seen anything like this park. Breathtakingly blue water, deep caves, and hidden jungles. I would make sure to pay the extra fee to go across the large lake.",
          "A name that translates to three lakes park, they are referring to bodies of water inside the limestone caves, three different sites; Lago de Azufree, La Nevera and Las Damas located in the Mirador del Este park. I learned that at one time, these waters were swimmable but some",
          "This was a random stop we made on our way out of Santo Domingo and it was definitely worth it. The water was super beautiful and the caves were fascinating. It is worth it to pay the dollar to take the ride across the water. Interesting little point in the city.",
          "We stopped here on our way to the colonial zone. It was amazing! Definitely get a guide, they point out all the cool fossils and explain the history. Don't miss the final boat ride!",
          "We stopped here on a tour and were glad we did. But we are Seniors, and I have an unsteady gait. However, my brother is well-coordinated-----so, he can easily help when I need him. Thanks to his occasional help. we had a great time. Without his help, it would have been very",
          "Inexpensive place for a family of 4. 100 pesos each to get in. Spent about an hour walking around and it was great. Very clean and nice walking paths. Lots of stairs. Reminds us of cenotes in Mexico. We took others advice and did not get a guide, and we did not need one either.",
          "Cave with sweet water, stalagmites and vats. 500 years ago was used for Indians. Natural, arqueologic and beautiful place.",
          "This partially open cave is a beautiful natural phenomenon which is well worth visiting. The floor and walls of the cave are carpeted with lush tropical plants, and the aqua lakes are stunning. An interesting low-tech boat carries you through a dark cave-tunnel to a fourth lake,",
          "I came to this place one of the days I had off from my mission trip . I thought it was beautiful . Crystalline and breathtaking waters . If you have some time off try to stop by",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit (I think, because from the performance of the guide I could not tell or understand anything). I know that it's a place where the local Taino used to live but I could not see/hear anything besides the local guide struggling to explain",
          "It is a beautiful Natural monument, the guides here are very very nice, and very cheap. Is an easy attraction to get to.",
          "So worth to visit this 100% nature place right in the center of the busy capital. Although they call it 3 eyes for 3 lakes they have inside the cave, actually there is the 4th lake and it's so wonderful and the way to it so interesting.Highly recommend if you are a nature lover.",
          "This was one of the places that we visited, It was a place to spend a little time and a nice place to see. If you have bad knees this is not the place for you there are a lot of stairs to climb.",
          "Well inside this nice place, you will find beautifull blue water coming from inside the earth I think that ist one of the most interesting places if you go with friends or with family, be sure to take a boat and go around and make nice photos.",
          "We visited Tres Ojos with our mission team on the way to the airport. We had a little extra time so this was perfect. The park is not very big so it doesn't take much time to get around it. There are some beautiful sights and the price was moderate.",
          "This was my favorite thing to see in Santo Domingo! Be ready for a workout- there are a lot of stairs. Once down inside you can see crystal clear blue water in the pools. I would recommend taking the boat (for a small fee) across to see the final pool Stunning views. This",
          "It was ok, and part of a tour package for us. It was not worth the time, not much to see and I would have rather spent more time touring the Zona Colonial for the amount of time we had in Santo Domingo. The tour takes less than an hour but you really only see the area around",
          "This was a pretty cool place to check out, especially if you don't have much else to do. It doesn't take a really long time to see all of it and it isn't really big. It didn't exactly knock my socks off with excitement and wonder but it was decent...like the title says. You",
          "Nice place to spend 1h, take some pics and see how it used to be before the asphalt jungle took over the land. If it was possible to take a swim, it would be great!",
          "This is an absolutely breathtaking experience. The admission into the park is inexpensive. You dont need a tour, just grab a cab (taxi) and pay the park admission. The tour prices are ridiculously expensive ranging from 90-150$ USD when you can do it privately for a faction",
          "Worth a visit if passing or staying in the capital. Bit touristy but good fun. Plagued by pesistent guide on arrival.",
          "If you like being in nature, this is a must see place in Santo Domingo. The 3 pools down inside the caves are amazingly blue and still. After you walk around the 3 pools, there is a raft that you can take through the cave to see a breathtaking view on the other side of the",
          "It was hard to find. Our taxi driver didn't know what we were referring too at first; apparently there is also a los tres ojos street in Santo Domingo. This was after debating with several guagua (local bus) passengers about the location and where/when to get off the bus. It's",
          "I rented a car and went alone and it was exceptionally beautiful! it only cost $100 pesos to get in which is about 2US dollars and you can stay as long as you want!",
          "A fun, natural diversion in the thick of Santo Domingo. There are several cool sights on this one small park, but it's all easy enough to take in on your own - no need to hire the hawkish guides near the entrance (near the hawkish taxi drivers). For what grandeur it has, it's",
          "Beautiful park in Santo Domingo. It takes about an hour to walk around. For a few bucks you can take a 'water gondola' to get to from the cave to the lake.",
          "We went ourselves and really loved the half day we spent there. I'd recommend wearing shoes that are comfortable and easy to walk in. The beautiful water and venue in the caves is awesome. There is a little raft that is an extra little bit but SO SO SO worth it.... that",
          "This is a really neat place to visit while in Santo Domingo. Our taxi ride was about 15 minutes from the Zona Colonial and our taxi driver waited for us while we were in the park. We paid 700 DOP for two people (round trip). Reading the reviews we were a little nervous about the",
          "This was amazing! The staff were really sweet. From the man willing to dive off the rock for $10 to the young guy pulling the boat from one side of the lake to the other. They've done an amazing job preserving this and keeping it as natural as possible. A must see if you're",
          "$3 US to get in, $36 for a guide you don't need. This park is home to 3 underground natural pools, in caves. It's pretty amazing to see. You can pay a bit to be taken deep inside on a little raft, but it's not necessary. Try to avoid the disgusting public washrooms and",
          "Visited Cueva Tres Ojos on a recent trip to Santo Domingo while staying at Sanctuary Cap Cana. Our tour guide was Gregory and he was very good. He was even able to show us an extra feature, a face in the cave that wasn't part of the regular tour, we just happened to be walking",
          "The first 3 lakes are close by, the 4th one is accessible through a pull boat (25 peso). Once you climb back up, you can only view the 4th lake from above. We went on our own without a guide. The guide for other group was volunteering to take picture for us, very nice. The",
          "It truly is a beautiful place to see. Definetly very humid down in the cave so dress cool. Beware of the vendors. They all have sad stories to tell you. Everything they are selling is overpriced.",
          "The place is amazing, it is what in M\u00e9xico we will call a \"Cenote\" and it is a must see while at Santo Domingo. There\u00b4s nothing else to do there except to see, learn and walk along the ponds (you CANNOT dive or swim there) and hear the stories. I would suggest to NOT buy stuff",
          "Be sure to take the ferry for 25 pesos across to the underground lake. Stunning little cavern in the city. It's 100 pesos to get in.",
          "This is a quick decent down to three pools of water. You can not go into the water. We basically walked down to one pool, took a few picture and then hiked back up...and back down to another pool. The local guide kept repeating the same information about how the pools were",
          "Great place, I highly recommend hiring a guide. Our guide, Juanita (Johnny Walker) has worked there for 31 years. He did a great job explaining everything to us, and took my camera and took a look of great pictures of us.",
          "It's a lot of stairs, but we had just finished eating a big lunch so was nice to get walking it off. There are 3 lakes that are very tempting to jump into. At the bottom cavern, there supposedly lives a Tarzan-figure who'll jump/dive into the water from the walls and people tip",
          "This is such a beautiful place. You would never believe that in the middle of know where you can find such an amazing place. So peaceful and tranquil.",
          "A low cost stop, a few knick-knack vendors but they're not pushy, lots of steps but you get to see cool underground ponds in the caves. Nice to get out of the sun on a hot day, bring some coins to pay the ferry-man.",
          "The underwater cavern has 3 lakes. It has clean beautiful water and even plenty of fish in them. There is a bit of a walk to get up and down the cave. You actually cross one of the lakes by a wooden raft to the far cave which is like a scene out of Jurassic Park. Just amazing!",
          "Its a hundred pesos to enter the park, you can see the many caves at your own pace. In order to take the boat to the other side of the park its $25 pesos cash. One thing that I did not like was that there were no maps available for visitors. Please do not pay for a guide. A",
          "They charge 100 pesos per person. The water was very dirty and did not look like the pictures. the entire place is not well taken care of. I don't know why anyone would need a guide as the place is very small. Disappointing.",
          "The cave is a great place to relax and see the clear water in the caves. Tour guide are available at a cost. They can lead you though the caves and point out things you may miss without them. We used one for out large party. The cave is keep clean and the water is beautiful. I",
          "An attraction on the way to Santo Domingo. The natural curvature of the steps and the cavern setting gives you a sense of going into the \"Batcave\" to hunt down the batmobile. Behold, you get to see emerald, blue-green pools fit for royal baths...stunning and not man-made.",
          "I remember the first time I went there as a little girl,the place seem full of mistery and wonder,and until this day nothing has changed.when you go in the caves there is a sense of respect for the things we can't see or understand!!!.",
          "It's so so. If you've got only 1 day in Santo Domingo, just skip this attraction. I'd rather spend more time at the colonial zone. There're a lot of stairs involved in this attraction and it was quite stuffy down there.",
          "Very nice caves with small several turqoise lakes. Interesting short stop along the way to Santo Domingo.",
          "I went to see Los Tres Ojos during the summer and it truly is beautiful. It is a series of caves with three lakes and it was truly remarkable to see this natural wonder. The only two negative aspects were the mosquitoes( and there are a lot of them because of the standing",
          "This is an extraordinary place where the pools of water are so still you can't see them until you put your hand into them. The colors are deep and natural and it's a must-see site when visiting Santo Domingo",
          "Very nice to see the beautiful caverns - be careful - many steps that are wet, slippery and uneven - inadequate handrails.",
          "Worth the 100 pesos each to get in. Lots of steps down to the 4th cave but sooooo well worth the walk. Take your time to see the stalactites and stalagmites and the beautiful clear blue water in the 4 caves. The boat ride for 25 pesos each to the final \"Jurassic park\" cave is",
          "This cave has a lot of uneven steps, so it is not good for people who can not walk well. There are 3 lakes in side of the cave and you can't go swimming but there is a small boat that takes you across one of the lakes. There is a young man you pulls on a ropes to get you across.",
          "We took a cab from the Zona Colonial and really enjoyed the 2 hours we spent at Los Tres Ojos. The blue color of the waters in the pools is very surreal, as are the rock formations in the caves and the trees with the spikey trunks. The 1st pool is the most impressive of the 3,",
          "We stopped here as part of a city tour and was give a guide for our group (Gregory). As we were an a time line we couldn't spend as much time as is really needed to see everything but what we saw was worth it. The only negative is our guide wouldn't let you pass by him to leave",
          "Worth the visit!!! Is cheap around dop150.00 around usd 3.00 adults plus dop 25.00 for the little boat inside the cave that takes you to the other side of the biggest cave. Impressive view a lot of humidity and a lil bit of breath limitation but it coul be handle!! ... Around",

          "If you love nature and natural wonders then you must visit this national park. It is a good place to take the family or for some outdoor exercise. It is inexpensive too.",
          "The limestone caves were really awesome and are surrounded by green lush vegetation. I highly recommend a visit to this spectacular park. I wish visitors were allowed to swim in the three lakes located within the caves, but of oh well.",

          "It was the first time I saw a place like this. The ecological reserve is only 15 - 20 min form the colonial part of Santo Domingo. We took a taxi who waited the 45 min visit. We went with our 1 year old boy and had a great time. The place is not very big, but the lakes, the",

          "You enter the park and descend into the caves by way of a staircase built all the way to the bottom. You can visit four viewing areas by each of the lakes inside. One lake is accessible only by boat - and a small fee. The caves are deep and wide. It isn't dark and gloomy. The",
          "This is beautiful place, it can be crowded at times but it doesn't take off its beauty. With boca Chica it's a must in Santo Domingo. It doesn't take long I'd say an hour and it's done.",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city.

It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six.

          "I visited the museum with my two kids, and it was hot. It's NOT a museum. You have some Larimar information highlights, a few raw stones, and that's it. It's just a trick to get you to the store and have you buying their stuff. The jewelry was pretty nice, but I've seen better",
          "Not surprisingly you pass through a shop on the ground floor to get to this mini-museum. (No hard sell though). You enter into a \"mine\" and learn about the geology of this attractive and rare stone. The story about its re-discovery is told in Spanish and English. Some texts are",
          "Attention all, in this little shop there are roguish sellers, I do not advise you to buy goods there, the fixings fell off from the earrings they bought for the second day! I made an order in this shop rings made of solid stone, initially requested $ 175, after $ 5 minutes $",
          "We heard so much about the larimar stone found only in the dominican Republic its worth visiting the museum to find out more. Our guide mentioned that its very expensive to buy from this store. We loved the banister that was made from larimar stone. We were surprised to hear it",
          "The Larimar Museum is located at the intersection of Calle Isabel Catolica and Calle Padre Billini, about 2-3 blocks south of where the TripAdvisor location is. All the Museums in Zona Colonial are stores with educational displays on the second floor, and the Larimar \u201cMuseum\u201d\u2019s",
          "This museum gives a nice little history of Larimar, which is only found in the Dominican Republic. There are great samples of the rock. The museum is located above a shop which sells Larimar jewelry. Jewelry in the shop is expensive - shop around and you may find prices",
          "A small, but interesting and informative collection about larimar, this blue semiprecious stone found only in DR, its forms and types, mining locations, formation etc. Downstairs there is a shop (for us it seemed a bit overpriced) and the museum is located upstairs. Entry is",
          "The exhibit was interesting, but very small and basically just a ploy to get tourists in to the shop. The jewelry is WAAY overpriced - we bought similar jewelry a few blocks over for less than 1/4th of the price.",
          "If you are in the colonial city this is a good place to visit, they have a lot of larimar and amber jewerly pieces to admire and to buy.",
          "The upstairs rooms have information on Larimar and a few really cool pieces, but that is just an excuse to have a good store. But is a really good store. The top floor is also interesting because you are able to see what a very grand house looked like and how it was built in the",

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

        "wiki": "Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita (12 October 1746 \u2013 April 1805) was a Brazilian composer, music teacher, conductor and organist.\n\n\n== Life ==\nEmerico was born at Vila do Pr\u00edncipe (now Serro), in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. His parents Jos\u00e9 Lobo de Mesquita and Joaquina Emerenciana gave him a liberal education. He received his first music lessons (organ and music theory) from Father Manuel da Costa Dantas, who was organist and choirmaster at the church Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o in Serro. Soon after 1776 he went to Arraial do Tijuco (now Diamantina) to become organist and conductor at the cathedral Santo Ant\u00f4nio of Diamantina. On 17 January 1789 he entered the religious order Ordem Terceira de Nossa Senhora do Carmo. He founded a music school in this city and was appointed teacher of the art of music. In 1798 he worked in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto) for the city mayor, and was also organist and choirmaster at the church Nossa Senhora do Pilar. He had a quarrel with the mayor and left for Rio de Janeiro, where he became organist of the Ordem Terceira do Carmo until his death, in April 1805.\nLobo de Mesquita was an important representative of the so-called Escola de Compositores da Capitania das Minas do Ouro (Composers' School of the Gold Mines Region).

        "wiki": "Located principally in the city centre or Cercado de Lima and R\u00edmac areas, the Historic Centre of Lima is among the most important tourist destinations in Peru.\n\n\n== Foundation ==\n\nThe city of Lima, the capital of Peru, was founded by Francisco Pizarro on 18 January 1535 and given the name City of the Kings. Nevertheless, with time its original name persisted, which may come from one of two sources: Either the Aymara language lima-limaq (meaning \"yellow flower\"), or the Spanish pronunciation of the Quechuan word rimaq (meaning \"talker\", and actually written and pronounced limaq in the nearby Quechua I languages). It is worth noting that the same Quechuan word is also the source of the name given to the river that feeds the city, the R\u00edmac River (pronounced as in the politically dominant Quechua II languages, with an \"r\" instead of an \"l\"). Early maps of Peru show the two names displayed jointly.\nIn 1988, UNESCO declared the historic center of Lima a World Heritage Site for its originality and high concentration of historic monuments constructed in the time of Spanish presence.\n\n\n== Balconies of Lima ==\n\nOf the structures in the historical center of Lima, situated are more than 1,600 balconies that were built in the viceroyalty era as well as in the republic. In order to retain its conservation, the Municipality of Lima has invited individuals and companies to adopt a balcony in order to maintain them as if they were new. The abundance of these balconies adds to the particular harmony and originality to this part of the city.\n\n\n== Colonial extravagance ==\nAt the time of the Viceroyalty of Peru, a work of art was created, a magnificence, a grandeur and a legendary royal life.The authority of the viceroy, like representative of the Spanish monarchy was particularly important, since its appointment supposed an important ascent and the successful culmination of a race in the colonial administration.\nThe entrances to Lima of the new viceroys were specially lavish. For the occasion, the streets were paved with silver bars from the doors of the city of Lima to the Palace of the Viceroy.\n\n\n== Principal Monuments ==\n\n\n=== Archbishop Palace ===\n\nThe Archbishop Palace is the home of the Archbishop of Lima. It is a popular tourist attraction in the Historical centre of Lima, Peru. The first major church began construction in 1535. Pope Paul III turned it into an episcopal seat in 1541.

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street. Some of these are:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColony of Santo Domingo\nTimeline of Santo Domingo\nPort of Santo Domingo\nOld San Juan, Puerto Rico\nOld Havana, Cuba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nMoreta Castillo, Am\u00e9rico \"El Santo Domingo del Siglo XVIII a trav\u00e9s del Libro Becerro\".  \"CLIO\" 74  (Santo Domingo, 2007) pp.  43\u201366.\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, Julio Amable \"Toponom\u00eda y Genealog\u00eda: La Ciudad Colonial (2 de 15)\". \"IDG\" (Santo Domingo, 2007)\nAlemar, Luis \"La Ciudad de Santo Domingo: Santo Domingo, Ciudad Trujillo\". \"Editora de Santo Domingo\" (Santo Domingo, 1980)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Colonial Zone Chronicles -promotes the cultural life of the City\nUnesco's World Heritage Site for Colonial City of Santo Domingo\nGuide to Colonial Zone, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic by Janette Keys",

        "wiki": "The Dominican Republic ( d\u0259-MIN-ik-\u0259n; Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, pronounced [re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0omini\u02c8kana] (listen)) is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with Haiti, making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two sovereign states. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area (after Cuba) at 48,671 square kilometers (18,792 sq mi), and third-largest by population with approximately 10.5 million people (2020 est.), of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. The official language of the country is Spanish.\nThe native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans, dividing it into five chiefdoms. The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years, and lived around the Caribbean islands. The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization. Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island, landing here on his first voyage in 1492. The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Meanwhile, France occupied the western third of Hispaniola, naming their colony Saint-Domingue, which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804. After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821. The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia, but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822. Independence came 22 years later in 1844, after victory in the Dominican War of Independence. Over the next 72 years the Dominican Republic experienced mostly internal conflicts and a brief return to Spanish colonial status before permanently ousting the Spanish during the Dominican War of Restoration of 1863\u20131865. The United States occupied the country between 1916 and 1924; a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio V\u00e1squez followed. From 1930 the dictatorship of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo ruled until 1961. A civil war in 1965, the country's last, was ended by U.S. military occupation and was followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer (1966\u20131978 and 1986\u20131996). Since 1978, the Dominican Republic has moved toward representative democracy. Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic's current president, succeeded Fern\u00e1ndez in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent ex-president Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda.\nThe Dominican Republic has the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region and is the eighth-largest economy in Latin America. Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the Western Hemisphere \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.3% between 1992 and 2018. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, and a high level of remittances.\nThe Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions. A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature of 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity. The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, a World Heritage Site. Music and sport are of great importance in the Dominican culture, with Merengue and Bachata as the national dance and music, and baseball as the most popular sport.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe \"Dominican\" word comes from the Latin Dominicus, meaning Sunday. However, the island has this name by Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n (Saint Dominic), founder of the Order of the Dominicans.The Dominicans established a house of high studies on the island of Santo Domingo that is now known as the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo and dedicated themselves to the protection of the native Ta\u00edno people, who were subjected to slavery, and to the education of the inhabitants of the island.For most of its history, up until independence, the country was known as Santo Domingo \u2013 the name of its present capital and patron saint, Saint Dominic \u2013 and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century.  The residents were called \"Dominicans\" (Dominicanos), the adjectival form of \"Domingo\", and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country \"Dominican Republic\" (Rep\u00fablica Dominicana).\nIn the national anthem of the Dominican Republic (himno nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana), the term \"Dominicans\" does not appear. The author of its lyrics, Emilio Prud'Homme, consistently uses the poetic term \"Quisqueyans\" (Quisqueyanos). The word \"Quisqueya\" derives from a native tongue of the Ta\u00edno Indians and means \"Mother of the lands\" (Madre de las tierras). It is often used in songs as another name for the country. The name of the country is often shortened to \"the D.R.\" (la R.D.)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-European history ===\n\nThe Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno moved into Hispaniola from the north east region of what is now known as South America, displacing earlier inhabitants, c. 650 C.E. They engaged in farming and fishing and hunting and gathering. The fierce Caribs drove the Ta\u00edno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century. The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, and four hundred thousand to two million. Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist. By 1492, the island was divided into five Ta\u00edno chiefdoms. The Ta\u00edno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.The Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Ta\u00ednos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagar\u00edx, Guam\u00e1, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Ta\u00ednos had declined drastically, due to smallpox, measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans, and from other causes discussed below.\nThe first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507. The last record of pure Ta\u00ednos in the country was from 1864. Still, Ta\u00edno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Ta\u00edno women, and some present-day Dominicans have Ta\u00edno ancestry. Remnants of the Ta\u00edno culture include their cave paintings, (including the Pomier Caves) as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Hig\u00fcerito, Moca.\n\n\n=== European colonization ===\n\nChristopher Columbus arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his four voyages to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it La Espa\u00f1ola due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the Spanish landscape. Traveling further east, Columbus came across the Yaque del Norte River in the Cibao region, which he named Rio de Oro after discovering gold deposits nearby. On Columbus's return during his second voyage, he established the settlement of La Isabela in what is now Puerto Plata on Jan. 1494, while he sent Alonso de Ojeda to search for gold in the region.\nIn 1496, Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher's brother, built the city of Santo Domingo, Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the \"New World.\" The colony thus became the springboard for the further Spanish conquest of the Americas and for decades the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere. Soon after, the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the cordillera central region, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus's cousin Giovanni Columbus had also discovered gold near Buenaventura; the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along San Crist\u00f3bal-Buenaventura and another in Cibao within the La Vega-Cotuy-Bonao triangle, while Santiago de los Caballeros, Concepcion, and Bonao became mining towns.  The gold rush of 1500\u20131508 ensued. Ferdinand II of Aragon \"ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown.\" Thus, Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines, though placers were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the \"best Indians\" working his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Crist\u00f3bal mining area supervised by salaried miners.Under Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, \"where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed,\" according to Pons.  By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the encomienda system.  According to Pons, \"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out.\"  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepci\u00f3n, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The repartimiento of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000 of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.  By 1519, according to Pons, \"Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time.\"The southern city of Santo Domingo served as the administrative heart of the expanding Spanish empire. Conquistadors like Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. Sugar cane was introduced to Hispaniola from the Canary Islands, and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola. The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the Real Audiencia from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\nIn the 1560s, English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of Mexico and Peru, while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free people of color, and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding intermixing, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Ta\u00edno, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became one of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\nBy the mid-17th century, the French sent colonists and privateers to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the pirates, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony on the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer economic decline.On April 17, 1655, the English landed on Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to Santo Domingo, the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted lancers, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite defenders of Santo Domingo were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a smallpox epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later, Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards attacked the north and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nThe House of Bourbon replaced the House of Habsburg in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last flotas sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by the emigration of Spaniards from the Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 18th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number, approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) \u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Ta\u00ednos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island. In our veins runs the blood of the heroic conquistadores who won this island of ours with sword and blood.'\n\nWhen the War of Jenkins' Ear between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish privateers, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to troll the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe. As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural hateros (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the French Revolution. French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not in Europe (see War of the Pyrenees). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the Treaty of Basel (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nFrom 1795 to 1822, Santo Domingo (the city) changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained there until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's longtime opponent.In 1801, Toussaint Louverture, who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the Treaty of Basel. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. Charles Leclerc when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, Dessalines, attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General Christophe marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned. In October 1808 the landowner Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and Jamaica. A combined Anglo-Spanish force recaptured the territory in 1809. The Spaniards, upon re-establishing control, not only tried to re-establish slavery in Santo Domingo, but many of them also mounted raiding expeditions into Haiti to capture blacks and enslave them as well.\n\n\n=== Independence from Spain (1821) ===\n\nAfter a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, declared the colony's independence from the Spanish crown as Spanish Haiti, on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.\n\n\n=== Unification of Hispaniola (1822\u201344) ===\n\nThe newly independent republic ended two months later under the Haitian government led by Jean-Pierre Boyer.As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and Joseph Balthazar Inginac's Code Rural. In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\nThe Haitians associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.Haiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the Espa\u00f1a Boba period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Gran Colombia. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the cibao region. After independence, and eventually being under Spanish rule once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from Spain.\n\n\n=== Dominican War of Independence (1844) ===\n\nIn 1838, Juan Pablo Duarte founded a secret society called La Trinitaria, which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention. Also Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez and Ramon Matias Mella, despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence. Duarte, Mella, and S\u00e1nchez are considered the three Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic.The Trinitarios took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian Charles H\u00e9rard who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for H\u00e9rard and now championed Dominican independence. After overthrowing Boyer, H\u00e9rard executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped. After subduing the Dominicans, H\u00e9rard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in Port-au-Prince. Haiti had formed two regiments composed of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo; these were used by H\u00e9rard to suppress the uprising.\n\nOn February 27, 1844, the surviving members of La Trinitaria declared the independence from Haiti. They were backed by Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle rancher from El Seibo, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first Constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the United States Constitution. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and Buenaventura B\u00e1ez held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, \u201cin Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and...the number of wounded was very superior...[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.\u201dThe Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845. The Haitians invaded again in 1849 after France recognized the Dominican Republic as an independent nation. In an overwhelming onslaught, the Haitians seized one frontier town after another. Santana being called upon to assume command of the troops, met the enemy at Ocoa, April 21, 1849, with only 400 men, and succeeded in utterly defeating the Haitian army. In November 1849 B\u00e1ez launched a naval offensive against Haiti to forestall the threat of another invasion. His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. In 1855, Haiti invaded again, but its forces were repulsed at the bloodiest clashes in the history of the Dominican\u2013Haitian wars, the Battle of Santom\u00e9 in December 1855 and the Battle of Sabana Larga in January 1856.\n\n\n=== First Republic ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's first constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.  It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by Pedro Santana on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.Without adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, Manuel Jimenes.\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3 besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.\n\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to colonial status. This action was supported by the cattlemen of the south while the northern elites opposed it. Spanish rule finally came to an end with the War of Restoration in 1865, after four years of conflict between Dominican nationalists and Spanish sympathizers. The war claimed more than 50,000 lives.Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant ordered U.S. Marines to the island for the first time. Pirates operating from Haiti had been raiding U.S. commercial shipping in the Caribbean, and Grant directed the Marines to stop them at their source. Following the virtual takeover of the island, B\u00e1ez offered to sell the country to the United States. Grant desired a naval base at Saman\u00e1 and also a place for resettling newly freed Blacks. The treaty, which included U.S. payment of $1.5 million for Dominican debt repayment, was defeated in the United States Senate in 1870 on a vote of 28\u201328, two-thirds being required.B\u00e1ez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and B\u00e1ez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General Ulises Heureaux.\"Lil\u00eds\", as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, \"a consummate dissembler\", who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular. In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the Dominican economy. The sugar industry was modernized, and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants.\n\n\n=== 20th century (1900\u201330) ===\n\nFrom 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.United States President Theodore Roosevelt sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future Panama Canal, as the canal was already under construction. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.\n\nAfter six years in power, President Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres (who had himself assassinated Heureaux) was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899\u20131902) Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former Secretary of War Desiderio Arias maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.\n\nWilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. U.S. Marines landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Vice Admiral Harry Shepard Knapp, was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces. The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President Warren G. Harding (1921\u201323), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.\n\nThe victor was former president (1902\u201303) Horacio V\u00e1squez, who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924 and the last U.S. forces left in September. In six years, the Marines were involved in at least 467 engagements, with 950 insurgents killed or wounded in action. V\u00e1squez gave the country six years of stable governance, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a relatively peaceful atmosphere.During the government of Horacio V\u00e1squez, Rafael Trujillo held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Pe\u00f1a, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez.\nIn February 1930, when V\u00e1squez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a; in return for letting Ure\u00f1a take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.\nAs per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.\n\n\n=== Trujillo Era (1930\u201361) ===\n\nThere was considerable economic growth during Rafael Trujillo's long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935 and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. Trujillo renamed Santo Domingo to \"Ciudad Trujillo\" (Trujillo City), the nation's \u2013 and the Caribbean's \u2013 highest mountain La Pelona Grande (Spanish for: The Great Bald) to \"Pico Trujillo\" (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak), and many towns and a province. Some other places he renamed after members of his family. By the end of his first term in 1934 he was the country's wealthiest person, and one of the wealthiest in the world by the early 1950s; near the end of his regime his fortune was an estimated $800 million. He used the secret police extensively to eliminate political opposition and to prevent several coup attempts during and after World War II. The secret police allegedly murdered more than 500,000 people during the Trujillo era.\nAlthough one-quarter Haitian, Trujillo promoted propaganda against Haitian people. In 1937, he ordered what became known as the Parsley Massacre or, in the Dominican Republic, as El Corte (The Cutting), directing the army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border. The army killed an estimated 17,000 to 35,000 Haitian men, women, and children over six days, from the night of October 2, 1937, through October 8, 1937. To avoid leaving evidence of the army's involvement, the soldiers used edged weapons rather than guns. The soldiers were said to have interrogated anyone with dark skin, using the shibboleth perejil (parsley) to distinguish Haitians from Afro-Dominicans when necessary; the 'r' of perejil was of difficult pronunciation for Haitians. As a result of the massacre, the Dominican Republic agreed to pay Haiti US$750,000, later reduced to US$525,000. In 1938, reports from the Dominican Republic revealed hundreds more Haitians had been killed and thousands deported.\nOn November 25, 1960, Trujillo killed three of the four Mirabal sisters, nicknamed Las Mariposas (The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia Mar\u00eda Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings, as did their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to Provincia Hermanas Mirabal (Mirabal Sisters Province). The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.\nFor a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, a fierce critic of Trujillo.Trujillo had become expendable. Dissidents inside the Dominican Republic argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo.According to Chester Bowles, the U.S. Undersecretary of State, internal Department of State discussions in 1961 on the topic were vigorous. Richard N. Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, who had direct contacts with the rebel alliance, argued for intervention against Trujillo. Quoting Bowles directly: The next morning I learned that in spite of the clear decision against having the dissident group request our assistance Dick Goodwin following the meeting sent a cable to CIA people in the Dominican Republic without checking with State or CIA; indeed, with the protest of the Department of State. The cable directed the CIA people in the Dominican Republic to get this request at any cost. When Allen Dulles found this out the next morning, he withdrew the order. We later discovered it had already been carried out.\n\n\n=== Post-Trujillo (1962\u20131996) ===\n\nTrujillo was assassinated on May 30, 1961 with weapons supplied by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist Juan Bosch took office but it was overthrown in September. On April 24, 1965, after 19 months of military rule, a pro-Bosch revolt broke out.Days later U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, concerned that Communists might take over the revolt and create a \"second Cuba,\" sent the Marines, followed immediately by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division and other elements of the XVIIIth Airborne Corps, in Operation Powerpack. \"We don't propose to sit here in a rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up any government in the western hemisphere,\" Johnson said. The forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents from the Organization of American States. All these remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer. He had been Trujillo's last puppet-president.\n\nThe Dominican death toll for the entire period of civil war and occupation totaled more than three thousand, many of them black civilians killed when the US-backed military junta engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the northern (also the industrial) part of Santo Domingo.Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included the construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive Columbus Lighthouse, completed in 1992 during a later tenure.\nDuring Balaguer's administration, the Dominican military forced Haitians to cut sugarcane on Dominican sugar plantations (bateyes).In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez, of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under Salvador Jorge Blanco. Under the PRD presidents, the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of relative freedom and basic human rights.\nBalaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, a former mayor of Santo Domingo. The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa.\n\n\n=== 1996\u2013present ===\n\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez achieved the first-ever win for the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD (which he also had founded). Fern\u00e1ndez oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.In 2000, the PRD's Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda won the election. This was a time of economic troubles. Mej\u00eda was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004 by Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the PLD. In 2008, Fern\u00e1ndez was as elected for a third term. Fern\u00e1ndez and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, such as the construction of the Metro Railway (\"El Metro\"). On the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.Danilo Medina of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016. On the other hand, a significant increase in crime, government corruption and a weak justice system threaten to overshadow their administrative period.The Dominican Republic has the ninth-largest economy in Latin America and is the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region. Over the last two decades, the Dominican Republic has had one of the fastest-growing economies in the Americas \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.4% between 1992 and 2014. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, as well as a high level of remittances.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic comprises the eastern five-eighths of Hispaniola, the second-largest island in the Greater Antilles, with the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with Haiti, the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being 376 km (234 mi). To the north and north-west lie The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and to the east, across the Mona Passage, the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The country's area is reported variously as 48,442 km2 (18,704 sq mi) (by the embassy in the United States) and 48,670 km2 (18,792 sq mi), making it the second largest country in the Antilles, after Cuba. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest city Santo Domingo is on the southern coast.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the Cordillera Septentrional (\"Northern Mountain Range\"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of Monte Cristi, near the Haitian border, to the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic \u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies \u2013 is the Cordillera Central (\"Central Mountain Range\"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of Azua, on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: Pico Duarte (3,098 metres or 10,164 feet above sea level), La Pelona (3,094 metres or 10,151 feet), La Rucilla (3,049 metres or 10,003 feet), and Pico Yaque (2,760 metres or 9,055 feet). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the Sierra de Neiba, while in the south the Sierra de Bahoruco is a continuation of the Massif de la Selle in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the Cordillera Oriental (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda, Sierra de Yamas\u00e1, and Sierra de Saman\u00e1.\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile Cibao valley. This major valley is home to the cities of Santiago and La Vega and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the Enriquillo Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the Constanza, Jarabacoa, Villa Altagracia, and Bonao valleys.\nThe Llano Costero del Caribe (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the savannahs that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the Plena de Azua (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in Azua Province. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the Pedernales Peninsula.\n\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The Yaque del Norte is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the Yuna River serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, tributary of the Yaque del Sur, which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The Artibonito is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is Enriquillo, a salt lake at 45 metres (148 ft) below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n or Cabral, with fresh water, and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with brackish water.\nThere are many small offshore islands and cays that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are Saona, in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. Smaller islands include the Cayos Siete Hermanos, Isla Cabra, Cayo Jackson, Cayo Lim\u00f3n, Cayo Levantado, Cayo la Bocaina, Catalanita, Cayo Pisaje and Isla Alto Velo. To the north, at distances of 100\u2013200 kilometres (62\u2013124 mi), are three extensive, largely submerged banks, which geographically are a southeast continuation of the Bahamas: Navidad Bank, Silver Bank, and Mouchoir Bank. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic. Isla Cabritos lies within Lago Enriquillo.\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered a magnitude 8.1 earthquake off the northeast coast, triggering a tsunami that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a tropical rainforest climate in the coastal and lowland areas. Due to its diverse topography, Dominican Republic's climate shows considerable variation over short distances and is the most varied of all the Antilles. The annual average temperature is 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). At higher elevations the temperature averages 18 \u00b0C (64.4 \u00b0F) while near sea level the average temperature is 28 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F). Low temperatures of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) are possible in the mountains while high temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are possible in protected valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the year while August is the hottest month. Snowfall can be seen on rare occasions on the summit of Pico Duarte.The wet season along the northern coast lasts from November through January. Elsewhere the wet season stretches from May through November, with May being the wettest month. Average annual rainfall is 1,500 millimetres (59.1 in) countrywide, with individual locations in the Valle de Neiba seeing averages as low as 350 millimetres (13.8 in) while the Cordillera Oriental averages 2,740 millimetres (107.9 in). The driest part of the country lies in the west.Tropical cyclones strike the Dominican Republic every couple of years, with 65% of the impacts along the southern coast. Hurricanes are most likely between June and October. The last major hurricane that struck the country was Hurricane Georges in 1998.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a representative democracy or democratic republic, with three branches of power: executive, legislative, and judicial. The president of the Dominican Republic heads the executive branch and executes laws passed by the congress, appoints the cabinet, and is commander in chief of the armed forces. The president and vice-president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for 4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of a senate, which has 32 members, and the Chamber of Deputies, with 178 members.Judicial authority rests with the Supreme Court of Justice's 16 members. They are appointed by a council composed of the president, the leaders of both houses of Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, and an opposition or non\u2013governing-party member. The court \"alone hears actions against the president, designated members of his Cabinet, and members of Congress when the legislature is in session.\"The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system. Elections are held every two years, alternating between the presidential elections, which are held in years evenly divisible by four, and the congressional and municipal elections, which are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four. \"International observers have found that presidential and congressional elections since 1996 have been generally free and fair.\" The Central Elections Board (JCE) of nine members supervises elections, and its decisions are unappealable. Starting from 2016, elections will be held jointly, after a constitutional reform.\n\n\n=== Political culture ===\nThe three major parties are the conservative Social Christian Reformist Party (Spanish: Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC)), in power 1966\u201378 and 1986\u201396; and the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD)), in power in 1963, 1978\u201386, and 2000\u201304; and the Dominican Liberation Party (Spanish: Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (PLD)), in power 1996\u20132000 and since 2004.\nThe presidential elections of 2008 were held on May 16, 2008, with incumbent Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez winning 53% of the vote. He defeated Miguel Vargas Maldonado, of the PRD, who achieved a 40.48% share of the vote. Amable Aristy, of the PRSC, achieved 4.59% of the vote. Other minority candidates, which included former Attorney General Guillermo Moreno from the Movement for Independence, Unity and Change (Spanish: Movimiento Independencia, Unidad y Cambio (MIUCA)), and PRSC former presidential candidate and defector Eduardo Estrella, obtained less than 1% of the vote.\nIn the 2012 presidential elections, the incumbent president Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez (PLD) declined his aspirations and instead the PLD elected Danilo Medina as its candidate. This time the PRD presented ex-president Hipolito Mejia as its choice. The contest was won by Medina with 51.21% of the vote, against 46.95% in favor of Mejia. Candidate Guillermo Moreno obtained 1.37% of the votes.In 2014, the Modern Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido revolucionario Moderno) was created by a faction of leaders from the PRD and has since become the predominant opposition party, polling in second place for the upcoming May 2016 general elections.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a close relationship with the United States, mostly with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and with the other states of the Inter-American system.\nThe Dominican Republic's relationship with neighbouring Haiti is strained over mass Haitian migration to the Dominican Republic, with citizens of the Dominican Republic blaming the Haitians for increased crime and other social problems. The Dominican Republic is a regular member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.\nThe Dominican Republic has a Free Trade Agreement with the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua via the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement. And an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union and the Caribbean Community via the Caribbean Forum.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nCongress authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. Approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The commander in chief of the military is the president.\nThe army is larger than the other services combined with approximately 56,780 active duty personnel, consisting of six infantry brigades, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. The Dominican Republic has the largest military in the Caribbean region surpassing Cuba.The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The secretary of the armed forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). The armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.In 2018, Dominican Republic signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces. Santo Domingo, the capital, is designated Distrito Nacional (National District). The provinces are divided into municipalities (municipios; singular municipio). They are the second-level political and administrative subdivisions of the country. The president appoints the governors of the 31 provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124 municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo). They are elected at the same time as congressional representatives.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the largest economy (according to the U.S. State Department and the World Bank) in the Caribbean and Central American region. It is an upper middle-income developing country, with a 2015 GDP per capita of US$14,770, in PPP terms. Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the Americas \u2013 with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.53% between 1992 and 2018. GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere. In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4%. As of 2015, the average wage in nominal terms is US$392 per month (RD$17,829). The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine.During the last three decades, the Dominican economy, formerly dependent on the export of agricultural commodities (mainly sugar, cocoa and coffee), has transitioned to a diversified mix of services, manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and trade. The service sector accounts for almost 60% of GDP; manufacturing, for 22%; tourism, telecommunications and finance are the main components of the service sector; however, none of them accounts for more than 10% of the whole. The Dominican Republic has a stock market, Bolsa de Valores de la Republica Dominicana (BVRD). and advanced telecommunication system and transportation infrastructure. High unemployment and income inequality are long-term challenges. International migration affects the Dominican Republic greatly, as it receives and sends large flows of migrants. Mass illegal Haitian immigration and the integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues. A large Dominican diaspora exists, mostly in the United States, contributes to development, sending billions of dollars to Dominican families in remittances.Remittances in Dominican Republic increased to US$4571.30 million in 2014 from US$3333 million in 2013 (according to data reported by the Inter-American Development Bank). Economic growth takes place in spite of a chronic energy shortage, which causes frequent blackouts and very high prices. Despite a widening merchandise trade deficit, tourism earnings and remittances have helped build foreign exchange reserves. Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation until 2002, after which the economy entered a recession.This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest commercial bank in the country, Baninter, linked to a major incident of fraud valued at US$3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%. All defendants, including the star of the trial, Ram\u00f3n B\u00e1ez Figueroa (the great-grandson of President Buenaventura B\u00e1ez), were convicted.\nAccording to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked No. 71 in the world for resource availability, No. 79 for human development, and No. 14 in the world for resource mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.\nThe Dominican Republic has a noted problem of child labor in its coffee, rice, sugarcane, and tomato industries. The labor injustices in the sugarcane industry extend to forced labor according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Three large groups own 75% of the land: the State Sugar Council (Consejo Estatal del Az\u00facar, CEA), Grupo Vicini, and Central Romana Corporation.According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 104,800 people are enslaved in the modern day Dominican Republic, or 1.00% of the population. Some slaves in the Dominican Republic are held on sugar plantations, guarded by men on horseback with rifles, and forced to work.\n\n\n=== Currency ===\n\nThe Dominican peso (abbreviated $ or RD$; ISO 4217 code is \"DOP\") is the national currency, with the United States dollar, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc also accepted at most tourist sites. The exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, liberalized by 1985, stood at 2.70 pesos per dollar in August 1986, 14.00 pesos in 1993, and 16.00 pesos in 2000. As of September 2018 the rate was 50.08 pesos per dollar.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions. A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature of 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity. The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, a World Heritage Site.Tourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean. With the construction of projects like Cap Cana, San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, Casa De Campo and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in Punta Cana, the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\nEcotourism has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like Jarabacoa and neighboring Constanza, and locations like the Pico Duarte, Bahia de las Aguilas, and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries are required to get a tourist card, depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10 km from the Haitian border.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are DR-1, DR-2, and DR-3, which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur (DR-5) or alternative routes (DR-4).\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa \u2013 Constanza) and DR-12 (Constanza \u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the Santiago light rail system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a rapid transit system in Santo Domingo, the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular Caribbean and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open as of August 2013, is 27.35 kilometres (16.99 mi). Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a well developed telecommunications infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and landline services. Cable Internet and DSL are available in most parts of the country, and many Internet service providers offer 3G wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes downstream/upstream speed; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend Wi-Fi hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the digital spectrum, via HD Radio and HDTV after officially adopting ATSC as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones).\nThe largest telecommunications company is Claro \u2013 part of Carlos Slim's Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil \u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and IPTV services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP. There were 2,439,997 Internet users in March 2009.In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a \"gender perspective\" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. This is part of the regional eLAC2010 plan. The tool the Dominicans have chosen to design and evaluate all the public policies is the APC Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM).\n\n\n=== Electricity ===\n\nElectric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez. The recent investment in a 345 kilovolt \"Santo Domingo\u2013Santiago Electrical Highway\" with reduced transmission losses, is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.\nDuring the Trujillo regime electrical service was introduced to many cities. Almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and most do not pay or pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 volts alternating at 60 Hz. Electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the Dominican Republic has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure. Concentrated efforts were announced to increase efficiency of delivery to places where the collection rate reached 70%. The electricity sector is highly politicized. Some generating companies are undercapitalized and at times unable to purchase adequate fuel supplies.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's population was 10,627,141 in 2018. In 2010, 31.2% of the population was under 15 years of age, with 6% of the population over 65 years of age. There were an estimated 102.3 males for every 100 females in 2020. The annual population growth rate for 2006\u20132007 was 1.5%, with the projected population for the year 2015 being 10,121,000.The population density in 2007 was 192 per km2 (498 per sq mi), and 63% of the population lived in urban areas. The southern coastal plains and the Cibao Valley are the most densely populated areas of the country. The capital city Santo Domingo had a population of 2,907,100 in 2010.Other important cities are Santiago de los Caballeros (pop. 745,293), La Romana (pop. 214,109), San Pedro de Macor\u00eds (pop. 185,255), Hig\u00fcey (153,174), San Francisco de Macor\u00eds (pop. 132,725), Puerto Plata (pop. 118,282), and La Vega (pop. 104,536). Per the United Nations, the urban population growth rate for 2000\u20132005 was 2.3%.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nIn a 2014 population survey, 70.4% self-identified as mixed (mestizo/indio 58%, mulatto 12.4%), 15.8% as black, 13.5% as white, and 0.3% as \"other\". Ethnic immigrant groups in the country include West Asians\u2014mostly Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians. East Asians, primarily ethnic Chinese and Japanese, can also be found. Europeans are represented mostly by Spanish whites but also with smaller populations of German Jews, Italians, Portuguese, British, Dutch, Danes, and Hungarians. Some converted Sephardic Jews from Spain were part of early expeditions; only Catholics were allowed to come to the New World. Later there were Jewish migrants coming from the Iberian peninsula and other parts of Europe in the 1700s. Some managed to reach the Caribbean as refugees during and after the Second World War. Some Sephardic Jews reside in Sos\u00faa while others are dispersed throughout the country. Self-identified Jews number about 3,000; other Dominicans may have some Jewish ancestry because of marriages among converted Jewish Catholics and other Dominicans since the colonial years. Some Dominicans born in the United States now reside in the Dominican Republic, creating a kind of expatriate community.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe population of the Dominican Republic is mostly Spanish-speaking. The local variant of Spanish is called Dominican Spanish, which closely resembles other Spanish vernaculars in the Caribbean and has similarities to Canarian Spanish. In addition, it has influences from African languages and borrowed words from indigenous Caribbean languages particular to the island of Hispaniola. Schools are based on a Spanish educational model; English and French are mandatory foreign languages in both private and public schools, although the quality of foreign languages teaching is poor. Some private educational institutes provide teaching in other languages, notably Italian, Japanese and Mandarin.Haitian Creole is the largest minority language in the Dominican Republic and is spoken by Haitian immigrants and their descendants. There is a community of a few thousand people whose ancestors spoke Saman\u00e1 English in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly enslaved African Americans who arrived in the nineteenth century, but only a few elders speak the language today. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country's economic ties with the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English. The Dominican Republic is ranked 2nd in Latin America and 23rd in the World on English proficiency.\n\n\n=== Population centres ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n95.0%  Christians 2.6%  No religion 2.2%  Other religions As of 2014, 57% of the population (5.7 million) identified themselves as Roman Catholics and 23% (2.3 million) as Protestants (in Latin American countries, Protestants are often called Evangelicos because they emphasize personal and public evangelising and many are Evangelical Protestant or of a Pentecostal group). From 1896 to 1907 missionaries from the Episcopal, Free Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist and Moravians churches began work in the Dominican Republic. Three percent of the 10.63 million Dominican Republic population are Seventh-day Adventists. Recent immigration as well as proselytizing efforts have brought in other religious groups, with the following shares of the population: Spiritist: 2.2%, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 1.3%, Buddhist: 0.1%, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed: 0.1%, Chinese Folk Religion: 0.1%, Islam: 0.02%, Judaism: 0.01%.\nThe Catholic Church began to lose its strong dominance in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, priests, and support programs. During the same time, Protestant Evangelicalism began to gain a wider support \"with their emphasis on personal responsibility and family rejuvenation, economic entrepreneurship, and biblical fundamentalism\". The Dominican Republic has two Catholic patroness saints: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Altagracia (Our Lady Of High Grace) and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes (Our Lady Of Mercy).\nThe Dominican Republic has historically granted extensive religious freedom. According to the United States Department of State, \"The constitution specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Vatican designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties.\" In the 1950s restrictions were placed upon churches by the government of Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the Catholic Church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was put into place, with his assassination.\nDuring World War II a group of Jews escaping Nazi Germany fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of Sos\u00faa. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.\n\n\n=== 20th century immigration ===\n\nIn the 20th century, many Arabs (from Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine), Japanese, and, to a lesser degree, Koreans settled in the country as agricultural laborers and merchants. The Chinese companies found business in telecom, mining, and railroads. The Arab community is rising at an increasing rate and is estimated at 80,000.In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, St. Vincent, Montserrat, Tortola, St. Croix, St. Thomas, and Guadeloupe. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds and Puerto Plata. Puerto Rican, and to a lesser extent, Cuban immigrants fled to the Dominican Republic from the mid-1800s until about 1940 due to a poor economy and social unrest in their respective home countries. Many Puerto Rican immigrants settled in Hig\u00fcey, among other cities, and quickly assimilated due to similar culture. Before and during World War II, 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican Republic.Numerous immigrants have come from other Caribbean countries, as the country has offered economic opportunities. There is an increasing number of Puerto Rican immigrants, especially in and around Santo Domingo; they are believed to number around 10,000. There are over 700,000 people of Haitian descent, including a generation born in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n==== Haitian immigration ====\n\nHaiti is the neighboring nation to the Dominican Republic and is considerably poorer, less developed and is additionally the least developed country in the western hemisphere. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% living in abject poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people also has a fast growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force lack formal jobs. Haiti's per capita GDP (PPP) was $1,800 in 2017, or just over one-tenth of the Dominican figure.As a result, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, with some estimates of 800,000 Haitians in the country, while others put the Haitian-born population as high as one million. They usually work at low-paying and unskilled jobs in building construction and house cleaning and in sugar plantations. There have been accusations that some Haitian immigrants work in slavery-like conditions and are severely exploited.Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.Haiti also suffers from severe environmental degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti's forests remain, and in many places the soil has eroded right down to the bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, some Haitian bootleggers have created an illegal market for charcoal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.In 2005, Dominican President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez criticized collective expulsions of Haitians as having taken place \"in an abusive and inhuman way.\" After a UN delegation issued a preliminary report stating that it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against people of Haitian origin, Dominican Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso issued a formal statement denouncing it, asserting that \"our border with Haiti has its problems[;] this is our reality and it must be understood. It is important not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not to confuse security with xenophobia.\"The children of Haitian immigrants are eligible for Haitian nationality, are denied it by Haiti because of a lack of proper documents or witnesses.\n\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nThe first of three late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo, due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general. In 1965, the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas. From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals.In the early 1980s, underemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to a third wave of emigration from the Dominican Republic. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high. In 2012, there were approximately 1.7 million people of Dominican descent in the U.S., counting both native- and foreign-born. There was also a growing Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico, with nearly 70,000 Dominicans living there as of 2010. Although that number is slowly decreasing and immigration trends have reversed because of Puerto Rico's economic crisis as of 2016.\nThere is a significant Dominican population in Spain.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nIn 2020, the Dominican Republic had an estimated birth rate of 18.5 per 1000 and a death rate of 6.3 per 1000.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary education is regulated by the Ministry of Education, with education being a right of all citizens and youth in the Dominican Republic.Preschool education is organized in different cycles and serves the 2\u20134 age group and the 4\u20136 age group. Preschool education is not mandatory except for the last year. Basic education is compulsory and serves the population of the 6\u201314 age group. Secondary education is not compulsory, although it is the duty of the state to offer it for free. It caters to the 14\u201318 age group and is organized in a common core of four years and three modes of two years of study that are offered in three different options: general or academic, vocational (industrial, agricultural, and services), and artistic.\nThe higher education system consists of institutes and universities. The institutes offer courses of a higher technical level. The universities offer technical careers, undergraduate and graduate; these are regulated by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nIn 2012, the Dominican Republic had a murder rate of 22.1 per 100,000 population. There was a total of 2,268 murders in the Dominican Republic in 2012.The Dominican Republic has become a trans-shipment point for Colombian drugs destined for Europe as well as the United States and Canada. Money-laundering via the Dominican Republic is favored by Colombian drug cartels for the ease of illicit financial transactions. In 2004, it was estimated that 8% of all cocaine smuggled into the United States had come through the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic responded with increased efforts to seize drug shipments, arrest and extradite those involved, and combat money-laundering.\nThe often light treatment of violent criminals has been a continuous source of local controversy. In April 2010, five teenagers, aged 15 to 17, shot and killed two taxi drivers and killed another five by forcing them to drink drain-cleaning acid. On September 24, 2010, the teens were sentenced to prison terms of three to five years, despite the protests of the taxi drivers' families.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDue to cultural syncretism, the culture and customs of the Dominican people have a European cultural basis, influenced by both African and native Ta\u00edno elements, although endogenous elements have emerged within Dominican culture; culturally the Dominican Republic is among the most-European countries in Spanish America, alongside Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. Spanish institutions in the colonial era were able to predominate in the Dominican culture's making-of as a relative success in the acculturation and cultural assimilation of African slaves diminished African cultural influence in comparison to other Caribbean countries.\nMusic and sport are of great importance in the Dominican culture, with Merengue and Bachata as the national dance and music, and baseball as the favorite sport.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nDominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of fine art that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between neoclassicism and romanticism. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of realism and impressionism. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe 20th century brought many prominent Dominican writers, and saw a general increase in the perception of Dominican literature.  Writers such as Juan Bosch (one of the greatest storytellers in Latin America), Pedro Mir (national poet of the Dominican Republic), Aida Cartagena Portalatin (poetess par excellence who spoke in the Era of Rafael Trujillo), Emilio Rodr\u00edguez Demorizi (the most important Dominican historian, with more than 1000 written works), Manuel del Cabral (main Dominican poet featured in black poetry), Hector Inchustegui Cabral (considered one of the most prominent voices of the Caribbean social poetry of the twentieth century), Miguel Alfonseca (poet belonging to Generation 60), Rene del Risco (acclaimed poet who was a participant in the June 14 Movement), Mateo Morrison (excellent poet and writer with numerous awards), among many more prolific authors, put the island in one of the most important in Literature in the twentieth century. \nNew 21st century Dominican writers have not yet achieved the renown of their 20th century counterparts. However, writers such as Frank B\u00e1ez (won the 2006 Santo Domingo Book Fair First Prize), Junot D\u00edaz (2008 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) and Emil Cerda (won the Premio Joven Destacado Award 2019 for his novel M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo espiritual Vol. 1), lead Dominican literature in the 21st century.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the European colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and baroque structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of Santo Domingo, which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the Americas, located in the city's Colonial Zone, an area declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The Ta\u00edno people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Ta\u00edno hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly Spanish, Ta\u00edno, and African. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and mang\u00fa (mashed, boiled plantain). Heartier versions of mang\u00fa are accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically), cheese, or both. Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and salad. \"La Bandera\" (literally \"The Flag\") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. Sancocho is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.\n\nMeals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with sofrito, which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and saut\u00e9ed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes or tipili (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include chicharr\u00f3n, yuca, casabe, pastelitos (empanadas), batata, yam, pasteles en hoja, chimichurris, and tostones.\nSome treats Dominicans enjoy are arroz con leche (or arroz con dulce), bizcocho dominicano (lit. Dominican cake), habichuelas con dulce, flan, fr\u00edo fr\u00edo (snow cones), dulce de leche, and ca\u00f1a (sugarcane). The beverages Dominicans enjoy are Morir So\u00f1ando, rum, beer, Mama Juana, batida (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), mab\u00ed, coffee, and chaca (also called maiz caqueao/casqueado, maiz con dulce and maiz con leche), the last item being found only in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n\nMusically, the Dominican Republic is known for the world popular musical style and genre called merengue, a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the tambora and g\u00fcira.\nIts syncopated beats use Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are Wilfrido Vargas, Johnny Ventura, singer-songwriter Los Hermanos Rosario, Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, To\u00f1o Rosario, Milly Quezada, and Chich\u00ed Peralta.\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 1990s, when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of bachata, along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.Bachata, a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was amargue (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term bachata became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called bolero. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\nPalo is an Afro-Dominican sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the Congo region of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.Salsa music has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like Johnny Pacheco, creator of the Fania All Stars, played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\nDominican rock and Reggaeton are also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Dise\u00f1o de Altos de Chav\u00f3n, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design. Noted fashion designer Oscar de la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga and then worked with the house of Lanvin in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles. Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America, where it became very popular, and remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n. De la Renta died of complications from cancer on October 20, 2014.\n\n\n=== National symbols ===\n\nSome of the Dominican Republic's important symbols are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem, titled Himno Nacional. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (meaning \"Dominican Republic\"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.\nThe national flower is the Bayahibe Rose and the national tree is the West Indian Mahogany. The national bird is the Cigua Palmera or Palmchat (\"Dulus dominicus\").The Dominican Republic celebrates Dia de la Altagracia on January 21 in honor of its patroness, Duarte's Day on January 26 in honor of one of its founding fathers, Independence Day on February 27, Restoration Day on August 16, Virgen de las Mercedes on September 24, and Constitution Day on November 6.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBaseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. The country has a baseball league of six teams. Its season usually begins in October and ends in January. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second highest number of Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Ozzie Virgil Sr. became the first Dominican-born player in the MLB on September 23, 1956. Juan Marichal, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, and Vladimir Guerrero are the only Dominican-born players in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Other notable baseball players born in the Dominican Republic are Jos\u00e9 Bautista, Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9, George Bell, Robinson Can\u00f3, Rico Carty, Bartolo Col\u00f3n, Nelson Cruz, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez, Francisco Liriano, David Ortiz, Pl\u00e1cido Polanco, Albert Pujols, Hanley Ram\u00edrez, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Jos\u00e9 Reyes, Sammy Sosa, and Miguel Tejada. Felipe Alou has also enjoyed success as a manager and Omar Minaya as a general manager. In 2013, the Dominican team went undefeated en route to winning the World Baseball Classic.\nIn boxing, the country has produced scores of world-class fighters and several world champions, such as Carlos Cruz, his brother Leo, Juan Guzman, and Joan Guzman. Basketball also enjoys a relatively high level of popularity. Tito Horford, his son Al, Felipe Lopez, and Francisco Garcia are among the Dominican-born players currently or formerly in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Olympic gold medalist and world champion hurdler F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez hails from the Dominican Republic, as does NFL defensive end Luis Castillo.Other important sports are volleyball, introduced in 1916 by U.S. Marines and controlled by the Dominican Volleyball Federation, taekwondo, in which Gabriel Mercedes won an Olympic silver medal in 2008, and judo.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Dominican Republic-related articles\nOutline of the Dominican Republic\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nThatsDominican.Com (June 18, 2011). \"Dominican Republic Population\".

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city.

It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east.

        "wiki": "Ciudad Colonial (Spanish for \"Colonial City\") is the historic central neighborhood of Santo Domingo and the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the of the Americas. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is also known as Zona Colonial (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as \"La Zona\" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the Ozama River, which bisects the city. It covers 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) bounded by a walled perimeter.\nIt is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, Fortaleza Ozama, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor, and others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by Bartholomew Columbus on the East bank of the Ozama River near the end of the XV century. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed Francisco de Bobadilla among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. Ovando and his successor Diego Col\u00f3n presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. Santo Domingo's fortifications were an important feature of the urban landscape. The defense wall (muralla) extended from the Ozama River to the Puerta del Conde, which was the entrance to the hinterland and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.\n\nThe Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering Mexico, Peru, and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a siege led by the English officers William Penn and Robert Venables. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva, to whom the Puerta del Conde (\"Gate of the Count\") is named after. The defensive wall was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the Puerta del Conde is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a bastion, El Baluarte del Conde.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the Trujillo era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Colonial City today ==\nThe Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.\nThe central public space of the district is Parque Colon, a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in its center. East of Parque Col\u00f3n, the cobblestone Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including Fortaleza Ozama, the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando and now a luxury hotel call Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando; the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic; and the Museo de las Casas Reales, in the former governors' palace and Audiencia building.\n\nCalle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the Puerta del Conde and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to tourists.On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family\u2014beginning with his son Diego\u2014is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A. It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.\n\n\n== Historical sites of Ciudad Colonial ==\n\nIn the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street.

          "We went very eager to hear about the history of Santo Domingo, but in summary, the Spaniards were good people and English were not... it was well made but that was it. Could have described a bit better the discovery, arrival of Cristobal Colon, etc. Otherwise, you can pay for a",

          "I seem to be in the minority here, but I found the whole 4d thing a bit tedious. The film gives some interesting viewpoints of 'The Pirate' Sir Francis Drake and his conquest of the city but I found the use if 3d plus shaking chairs, water spray and bubbles a bit tedious to say",
          "I really enjoyed this experience!! It costs about $8.50 in US currency to get in. After exploring the city on a hot day this is a wonderful retreat into a cool spot. It is done nicely from start to finish. It is a small setting so you are right up in the action. I found",

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse.

          "This monument is known locally as the \"Obelisco Macho\". It is located at the intersection of Av. George Washington and Pdte. Vicini Burgos. This area is a short walk west on the Malecon. The 137 foot tall obelisk was built in 1935 to recognise the renaming of the city from Santo",
          "This obelisk is only just that. an obelisk commemorating Dominican history. It is something you will see if you travel the malecon but not worth an extra trip if you are not going that way.",
          "its very nice and it gas its history dut is in the middele of a circle of a crowded avenue, you should pass by.",
          "Interesting to walk down to the coast here, not really worth a special trip. It is a major traffic route so noisy and care needed to cross road.",
          "It\u2019s definitely worth checking out to take a few photos and marvel at this beautiful monument if you are near the Melacon. But you will not spend more then a few minutes at this site. I would recommend stopping here fir photos and then taking a nice walk along the ocean and then",
          "The Mirabal Sisters were martyred by dictator Trujillo in the 1060's. They were rebels against a regime that was cruel and unyielding against their husbands, and their ideals of liberty. Worth the stop for pictures and an introduction to these bfrave women. But, its a traffic",

          "Situated on the waterfront, this is a very busy area with a major road and traffic to negotiate if you are walking. A bit of a rough crowd and was approached by many hustlers looking to get my money one way or another. The beach itself is a total mess, strewn with garbage. A bit",
          "Not much I can say other than a obelisk that's been tainted in godly pictures. Took a trip by bus so didn't really get a good enough view",

          "interesting history given that it's something trujillo erected during his reign of awfulness. more recently, they made it a monument to the people and from the looks of it, as a memorial to trujillo's most famous victims-the mirabel sisters who are commonly represented as/with",

        "wiki": "The recorded history of the Dominican Republic began when the Genoa-born navigator Christopher Columbus, working for the Spanish Crown, happened upon a large island in the region of the western Atlantic Ocean that later came to be known as the Caribbean. It was inhabited by the Ta\u00edno, an Arawakan people, who variously called their island Ayiti, Bohio, or Quisqueya (Kiskeya). Columbus promptly claimed the island for the Spanish Crown, naming it La Isla Espa\u00f1ola (\"the Spanish Island\"), later Latinized to Hispaniola. What would become the Dominican Republic was the Spanish Captaincy General of Santo Domingo until 1821, except for a time as a French colony from 1795 to 1809. It was then part of a unified Hispaniola with Haiti from 1822 until 1844. In 1844, Dominican independence was proclaimed and the republic, which was often known as Santo Domingo until the early 20th century, maintained its independence except for a short Spanish occupation from 1861 to 1865 and occupation by the United States from 1916 to 1924.\n\n\n== Pre-Spanish history ==\n\nThe Ta\u00edno people called the island Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (land of high mountains). At the time of Columbus' arrival in 1492, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\n\n\n== Spanish colony: 1492\u20131795 ==\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Spanish ===\n\nChristopher Columbus reached the island of Hispa\u00f1ola on his first voyage, in December 1492. On Columbus' second voyage in 1493, the colony of La Isabela was built on the northeast shore. Isabela nearly failed because of hunger and disease. In 1496 Santo Domingo was built and became the new capital. Here the New World's first cathedral was erected, and for a few decades, Santo Domingo was also the administrative heart of the expanding empire. Before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors, men like Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro lived and worked in Santo Domingo.\nCaonabo, the cacique, (leader or chief), of Maguana, one of five Taino geographical divisions on Hispaniola, attacked Columbus on January 13, 1493. Shooting arrows and wounding a few Spaniards, the Tainos halted the invaders' collection of provisions for Columbus's return trip to Spain. Caonabo struck again when his forces attacked and burned a fort built by Columbus, killing forty Spaniards. During the last trip of Christopher Columbus, in 1495, the Taino leader Guarionex, supported by Caonabo and other Taino leaders, staged the Battle of La Vega Real against the Spanish in 1495. But while more than ten thousand Tainos fought against the Spanish, they succumbed to the power of the Spanish weaponry.\nWhen Guarionex attacked the Spanish again, in 1497, both he and Caonabo were caught by the Spanish and both shipped to Spain; on the journey Caonabo died\u2014according to legend, of rage\u2014and Guarionex drowned. His wife, Anacaona, moved to the Xaragua division, where her brother, Bohechio, was cacique. After Bohechio's death, she became cacique and subsequently extended refuge and assistance to runaway enslaved Tainos and Africans.\nOne hundred thousand Tainos died from 1494\u20131496, half of them by their own hand through self-starvation, poison, leaps from cliffs, etc. The conquistador-turned-priest Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas wrote an eyewitness history of the Spanish incursion into the island of Hispaniola that reported the conquistadors' almost feral misconduct:\n\nInto this land of meek outcasts there came some Spaniards who immediately behaved like ravening wild beasts, wolves, tigers or lions that had been starved for many days. And Spaniards have behaved in no other way during the past forty years, down to the present time, for they are still acting like ravening beasts, killing, terrorizing, afflicting, torturing, and destroying the native peoples, doing all this with the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty.\n\n\n=== Sixteenth century ===\n\nHundreds of thousands of Tainos living on the island were enslaved to work in gold mines. As a consequence of disease, forced labor, famine, and mass killings, by 1508, only 60,000 were still alive. In 1501, the Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand I and Isabella, first granted permission to the colonists of the Caribbean to import African slaves, who began arriving to the island in 1503. The first enslaved blacks were purchased in Lisbon, Portugal. Some had been transported there from the West African Guinea coast, and others had been born and raised in Portugal or Spain. Southern Spain and Portugal were multiethnic and multiracial regions long before the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, and many Africans, free and enslaved, participated in the Iberian Peninsula's conquest and colonization of the Americas.In 1510, the first sizable shipment, consisting of 250 Black Ladinos, arrived in Hispaniola from Spain. Eight years later African-born slaves arrived in the West Indies. Many of the Africans brutally jammed into the slave ships had been the losers in Africa's endemic and endless wars. Others were kidnapped from the coast or taken from villages inland. The Colony of Santo Domingo was organized as the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo in 1511. Sugar cane was introduced to Hispaniola from the Canary Islands, and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola. The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the Real Audiencia from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their hides. The enslaved population numbered between twenty and thirty thousand in the mid-sixteenth century and included mine, plantation, cattle ranch, and domestic laborers. A small Spanish ruling class of about twelve hundred monopolized political and economic power, and it used ordenanzas (laws) and violence to control the population of color.\nIn 1517, a guerrilla war between the colonizers and Taino and African forces was initiated by the Taino leader Enriquillo. Descending from the Bahoruco Mountains with his troops, Enriquillo killed Spaniards, devastated farms and property, and took Africans back with him. The crown appointed General Francisco Barrionuevo, a veteran of many battles in Spain, as captain to lead the war against Enriquillo. Barrionuevo opted to negotiate, realizing that violence had not worked and that resources for more armed actions were scarce. In 1533 he met Enriquillo on what is today's Cabrito Island, in the middle of Lake Jaragua (now Enriquillo Lake) and reached a peace agreement that granted Enriquillo and his troops freedom and land.\nThe first known armed rebellion of enslaved Africans occurred in 1521. On Christmas Eve two hundred enslaved workers fled the plantation of Diego Columbus, located on the Isabela River near Santo Domingo, and headed south toward Azua. Others from plantations in Nigua, San Crist\u00f3bal, and Ban\u00ed joined them on the march, burning plantations and killing several Spaniards. According to official records, they stopped next at the Ocoa plantation, with the intention of killing more whites and recruiting more enslaved blacks and Indians, then moved on to Azua. After being informed of the insurrection, Columbus recruited a small army, which, mounted on horseback and shouting their battle cry \"Santiago\", headed south in pursuit. In the meantime, the rebels entered the plantation of Melchor de Castro near the Nizao River where they killed one Spaniard, sacked the house, and freed more enslaved persons, including Indians. Columbus's army confronted the rebels at the Nizao, the Spanish shooting at them with guns and the rebels responding by throwing stones and logs. Five days later the Spanish attacked again. They caught several rebels, whom they executed by lynching along the colonial road, but many more had escaped to face later attacks, in which more were killed or apprehended.\nBy the mid-sixteenth century, there were an estimated seven thousand maroons (runaway slaves) beyond Spanish control on Hispaniola. The Bahoruco Mountains were their main area of concentration, although Africans had escaped to other areas of the island as well. From their refuges, they descended to attack the Spanish. In 1546 the slave Diego de Guzman led an insurrection that swept through the San Juan de la Maguana area, after which he escaped to the Bahoruco Mountains. After his capture, de Guzman was savagely killed and some of his fellow rebels were burned alive, others burned with branding irons, others hung, and others had their feet cut off. The most extended insurrection was led by Sebasti\u00e1n Lemba. For fifteen years Lemba attacked Spanish towns, plantations, and farms with an army of four hundred Africans. Lemba was eventually caught and was executed in 1548. His head was mounted on the door that connected the Fort of San Gil (today Fort Ozama) to Fort Conde, and for centuries it was called \"the Lemba door\". Insurrections continued to burden the colony's tranquility and economy. From 1548 to the end of the sixteenth century, maroons attacked farms, plantations, and villages. By 1560 the colony was unable to recruit and pay troops to pursue the rebels.\nWhile sugar cane dramatically increased Spain's earnings on the island, large numbers of the newly imported slaves fled into the nearly impassable mountain ranges in the island's interior, joining the growing communities of cimarr\u00f3nes\u2014literally, 'wild animals'. By the 1530s, cimarr\u00f3n bands had become so numerous that in rural areas the Spaniards could only safely travel outside their plantations in large armed groups. Beginning in the 1520s, the Caribbean Sea was raided by increasingly numerous French pirates. In 1541 Spain authorized the construction of Santo Domingo's fortified wall, and in 1560 decided to restrict sea travel to enormous, well-armed convoys. In another move, which would destroy Hispaniola's sugar industry, in 1561 Havana, more strategically located in relation to the Gulf Stream, was selected as the designated stopping point for the merchant flotas, which had a royal monopoly on commerce with the Americas. In 1564, the island's main inland cities Santiago de los Caballeros and Concepci\u00f3n de la Vega were destroyed by an earthquake. In the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas.\n\nWith the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of Mexico and Peru, while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding intermixing, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, African, and Ta\u00edno descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the sole source of livelihood for the island dwellers.\nIn 1586, Sir Francis Drake captured the city of Santo Domingo, collecting a ransom for its return to Spanish rule. A third of the city lay in ruins and almost all of its civic, military and religious buildings had been either damaged or destroyed. During his occupation of Santo Domingo, Drake sent a black boy with a message to the governor. A Hidalgo who was standing by considered this an insult and ran the boy through with his sword. The English commander, infuriated, proceeded to the spot where the murder had been committed and had two friars hanged. He told the governor that he would hang two more friars every day until the murderer had been executed. The murderer was hanged by his own countrymen.\nIn 1592, Christopher Newport attacked the town of Azua on the bay of Ocoa, which was taken and plundered. In 1595 the Spanish, frustrated by the twenty-year rebellion of their Dutch subjects, closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren on the Spanish main.\n\n\n=== Seventeenth century ===\n\nIn 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island were carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe, and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of Santo Domingo. This action, known as the Devastaciones de Osorio, proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.  Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops \u2013 many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships. The settlements of La Yaguana, and Bayaja, on the west and north coasts respectively of modern-day Haiti were burned, as were the settlements of Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata on the north coast and San Juan de la Maguana in the southwestern area of the modern-day Dominican Republic.\nThe withdrawal of the colonial government from the northern coastal region opened the way for French buccaneers, who had a base on Tortuga Island, off the northwest coast of present-day Haiti, to settle on Hispaniola in the mid-seventeenth century. Although the Spanish destroyed the buccaneers' settlements several times, the determined French would not be deterred or expelled. The creation of the French West India Company in 1664 signalled France's intention to colonize western Hispaniola. Intermittent warfare went on between French and Spanish settlers over the next three decades; however, Spain, hard-pressed by warfare in Europe, could not maintain a garrison in Santo Domingo sufficient to secure the entire island against encroachment. In 1697, under the Treaty of Ryswick, Spain ceded the western third of the island to France.\nIn 1655, Oliver Cromwell dispatched a fleet, commanded by Admiral Sir William Penn, to conquer Santo Domingo. A Spanish defending force of perhaps 400\u2013600 men, mostly militia, repulsed a landing force of 9,000 men. Yet although the English had failed to overrun the island, they nevertheless seized nearby Jamaica, and other foreign strongholds subsequently began multiplying throughout the West Indies. Madrid sought to contest such encroachments by using Santo Domingo as an advance military base, but Spanish power was by now too depleted to expel the rival colonies. The city itself was furthermore subjected to a smallpox epidemic, cacao blight, and hurricane in 1666; another storm two years later; a second epidemic in 1669; a third hurricane in September 1672; plus an earthquake in May 1673 that killed two dozen residents.During this seventeenth \"century of misery\", the Spanish on Hispaniola continued to persecute maroons living peacefully in the island's interior mountains and valleys. With little to show for it, this policy of armed harassment added more public expense to a weak colonial economy, and the financial recovery of the Spanish colony in the eighteenth century led to increased slave insurrections and marronage.\n\n\n=== Eighteenth century ===\nThe House of Bourbon replaced the House of Habsburg in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last flotas sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. The population of Santo Domingo grew from about 6,000 in 1737 to approximately 125,000 in 1790. Of this number, about 40,000 were white landowners, about 25,000 were mulatto freedmen, and some 60,000 were slaves. However, it remained poor and neglected, particularly in contrast with its western, French neighbor Saint-Domingue, which became the wealthiest colony in the New World and had half a million inhabitants. The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, said to themselves: \"It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island. In our veins runs the blood of the heroic conquistadores who won this island of ours with sword and blood.\"When the War of Jenkins' Ear between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish privateers, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to troll the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. These practices of human traffic and terror facilitated capital accumulation. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.Dominicans constituted one of the many diverse units which fought alongside Spanish forces under Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez during the conquest of British West Florida (1779\u20131781).As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural hateros (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the French Revolution. French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe. The Spanish colony was ceded first to France in 1795 as part of the Treaty of Basel between the defeated Spanish and the French, then it was invaded by the British in 1796. Five years later, black slaves in rebellion invaded from Saint-Domingue. The devastated Spanish-speaking colony was then occupied by the French in 1802, in spite of the dramatic defeat of Napoleon's forces at the hands of the former French slaves who proclaimed the independent Republic of Haiti in 1804. Santo Domingo was invaded again by Haitians in 1805 and then yet again by the British in 1809. The Spanish reclaimed it later that year but found the colony in economic ruins and demographic decline.\n\n\n== Spanish colony: 1809\u20131821 ==\n\nThe population of the new Spanish colony stood at approximately 104,000. Of this number, about 30,000 were slaves, and the rest a mixture of white, Indian, and black. The European Spaniards were few, and consisted principally of Catalans. In 1812, a group of blacks and mulattoes staged a rebellion, with the goal of annexation to the Republic of Haiti. On August 15 and 16, mulattoes Jos\u00e9 Leocadio, Pedro Seda, and Pedro Henriquez, with other conspirators, attacked the Mendoza hacienda in Mojarra in the municipality of Guerra near the capital. Seda and Henriquez were apprehended and executed; Leocadio was captured within days, hanged, dismembered, and boiled in oil. A year later enslaved laborers in the rural community El Chav\u00f3n also rebelled, but they were quickly caught and executed.\nSpain's hold over Santo Domingo remained precarious. The arrival of the fugitive Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and his followers in Haiti in 1815 alarmed the Spanish authorities in Santo Domingo. Following the rebellion of the Army in Spain during 1820, which restored the liberal constitution, some of the colonial administrators in Santo Domingo broke with the mother country; and on December 1, 1821, the Spanish Lieutenant Governor, Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, proclaimed the independence of \"Spanish Haiti\".\nDominican leaders\u2014recognizing their vulnerability both to Spanish and to Haitian attack and also seeking to maintain their slaves as property\u2014attempted to annex themselves to Gran Colombia. While this request was in transit, Jean-Pierre Boyer, the ruler of Haiti, invaded Santo Domingo on February 9 with a 10,000-man army. Having no capacity to resist, N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres surrendered the capital on February 9, 1822.\n\n\n== Unification of Hispaniola 1822\u20131844 ==\n\nThe twenty-two-year Haitian occupation that followed is recalled by Dominicans as a period of brutal military rule, though the reality is more complex. It led to large-scale land expropriations and failed efforts to force production of export crops, impose military services, restrict the use of the Spanish language, and eliminate traditional customs such as cockfighting. It reinforced Dominicans' perceptions of themselves as different from Haitians in \"language, race, religion and domestic customs\". Yet, this was also a period that definitively ended slavery as an institution in the eastern part of the island.\nHaiti's constitution forbade whites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Most emigrated to the Spanish colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, or to independent Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. Santo Domingo's university, the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, lacking students, teachers, and resources, closed down. In order to receive diplomatic recognition from France, Haiti was forced to pay an indemnity of 150 million francs to the former French colonists, which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, and Haiti imposed heavy taxes on the eastern part of the island. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint.\nAttempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's Code Rural. In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\n\n== Independence: First Republic 1844\u20131861 ==\nOn July 16, 1838,  Juan Pablo Duarte together with Pedro Alejandrino Pina, Juan Isidro P\u00e9rez, Felipe Alfau, Benito Gonz\u00e1lez, F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Ruiz, Juan Nepumoceno Ravelo and Jacinto de la Concha founded a secret society called La Trinitaria to win independence from Haiti. A short time later, they were joined by Ram\u00f3n Mat\u00edas Mella, and Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez. In 1843 they allied with a Haitian movement in overthrowing Boyer. Because they had revealed themselves as revolutionaries working for Dominican independence, the new Haitian president, Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard, exiled or imprisoned the leading Trinitarios (Trinitarians). At the same time, Buenaventura B\u00e1ez, an Azua mahogany exporter and deputy in the Haitian National Assembly, was negotiating with the French Consul-General for the establishment of a French protectorate. In an uprising timed to preempt B\u00e1ez, on February 27, 1844, the Trinitarios declared independence from Haiti, backed by Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle-rancher from El Seibo who commanded a private army of peons who worked on his estates.\n\n\n=== First Republic ===\n\nThe Dominican Republic's first constitution was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.  It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by Pedro Santana on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.\n\nH\u00e9rard sent three columns of Haitian troops, each numbering 10,000 men, to reestablish his authority. In the south, Santana defeated H\u00e9rard at the Battle of Azua on March 19. Dominican forces suffered no casualties in the battle, while the Haitians sustained over 1,000 killed. In the north, Dominican General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert defeated the Haitian column led by Jean-Louis Pierrot at the Battle of Santiago. Over 600 Haitians were killed while the Dominicans suffered no casualties. Events at sea also went poorly for the Haitians. Three Dominican schooners under the command of Juan Bautista Cambiaso intercepted a Haitian brigantine and two schooners which were bombarding shore targets. In the ensuing engagement, all three Haitian vessels were sunk, ensuring Dominican naval superiority for the rest of the war. On August 6, 1845, the new Haitian president, Luis Pierrot, launched a new invasion. On September 17, Dominican General Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Puello defeated the Haitian vanguard near the frontier at Estrelleta where the Dominican square, with bayonets, repulsed a Haitian cavalry charge. The Dominicans suffered no deaths during the battle and only three wounded. On September 27, 1845, Dominican General Francisco Antonio Salcedo defeated the Haitian army at the Battle of Beler. Salcedo was supported by Admiral Juan Bautista Cambiaso's squadron of three schooners, which blockaded the Haitian port of Cap-Ha\u00eftien. Haitian losses were 350 killed and 10 captured; the Dominicans lost 16 killed.\nSantana used the ever-present threat of Haitian invasion as a justification for consolidating dictatorial powers. For the Dominican elite\u2014mostly landowners, merchants and priests\u2014the threat of re-annexation by more populous Haiti was sufficient to seek protection from a foreign power. Offering the deepwater harbor of Saman\u00e1 bay as bait, over the next two decades, negotiations were made with Britain, France, the United States and Spain to declare a protectorate over the country.\nThe constant threat and fear of renewed Haitian intervention required all men of fighting age to take up arms in defense against the Haitian military. Theoretically, fighting age was generally defined as between fifteen and eighteen years of age to forty or fifty years. Despite wide, popular glorification of military service, many in the ranks of the Liberation Army were mutinous and desertion rates were high despite penalties as severe as death for shirking the obligation of military service.\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the Cibao Valley, the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, Manuel Jimenes.\nAfter returning to lead Dominican forces against a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo, deposing Jimenes. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. B\u00e1ez determined to take the offensive against Haiti. His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. In 1853 Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing the last Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. The Cibanian tobacco planters, who were ruined when inflation ensued, revolted, recalling Santana from exile to lead their rebellion. After a year of civil war, Santana seized Santo Domingo and installed himself as president.\nIn 1860, a group of Americans tried unsuccessfully to take over the small Dominican island of Alto Velo off the southwestern border coast of Hispaniola.\n\n\n== Spanish colony: 1861\u20131865 ==\nPedro Santana inherited a bankrupt government on the brink of collapse. Having failed in his initial bids to secure annexation by the U.S. or France, Santana initiated negotiations with Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Captain-General of Cuba to have the island reconverted into a Spanish colony. The American Civil War rendered the United States incapable of enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. In Spain, Prime Minister Don Leopoldo O'Donnell advocated renewed colonial expansion, waging a campaign in northern Morocco that conquered the city of Tetuan. In March 1861, Santana officially restored the Dominican Republic to Spain.\nSantana initially was named Capitan-General of the new Spanish province, but it soon became obvious that Spanish authorities planned to deprive him of his power, leading him to resign in 1862. Restrictions on trade, discrimination against the mulatto majority, and an unpopular campaign by the new Spanish Archbishop, Bienvenido Monz\u00f3n, against extramarital unions, which were widespread after decades of abandonment by the Catholic Church, all fed resentment of Spanish rule.\nMonz\u00f3n also persecuted Freemasons, whose activities were widespread before the annexation, barring them from communion until they canted their vows and gave up their Masonic documents and practices. Monz\u00f3n actively persecuted Protestants as well. Protestant churches in Saman\u00e1 and Santo Domingo were taken over, burned, or confiscated for military purposes, forcing many Dominican Protestants to consider moving to Haiti in search of religious toleration.\nOn August 16, 1863, a national war of restoration began in Santiago, where the rebels established a provisional government. \"Before God, the entire world, and the throne of Castile, just and legal reasons have obliged us to take arms to restore the Dominican Republic and reconquer our liberty,\" the provisional government's declaration of independence read. Dominicans were divided. Some fought for the reserve forces alongside Spanish troops. Santana returned to lead them.\n\n\n=== War of Restoration ===\n\nThe Spanish forces of the Cibao valley were obliged to concentrate in Fort San Luis, at Santiago, where they were besieged by the insurgents. The rebels had possession of three forts which face the Puerto Plata road. They undertook to make a general assault on the fort where the Spanish troops were concentrated. The besieged forces let the enemy's bands come near, and when within musket range opened a tremendous fire of artillery, which, committing great destruction, drove them back in disorder. They, however, tried their luck again, and this time set fire to the houses of the town in different parts and made their attack in the midst of the conflagration. Spanish reinforcements arrived and charged the insurgents, who received them with grapeshot and musketry from the three forts which they held. The insurgents were repulsed and the forts retaken at the point of the bayonet. The garrison of Santiago abandoned the city and marched to Puerto Plata, the main northern port, attacked by Dominicans all the way. The Spaniards reportedly lost 1,300 men. They joined the garrison in the fort at Puerto Plata, leaving the city to be pillaged by the rebels. Eventually, 600 Spanish sallied out and drove off the rebels, with help from the cannon of the fort, but by then the city had been plundered and burnt almost out of existence. The damage to Santiago and Puerto Plata was estimated at $5,000,000. By mid-November, virtually the whole garrisons of Cuba and Puerto Rico were deployed on Santo Domingo and 8,000 troops had been sent from Europe, diverted from deployment in Morocco. The Spanish navy had complete command of the sea and used a fleet of paddle wheel steamers to transport troops to, and around, the island.\nAs the fighting continued, racist incidents became more acute. Spanish soldiers were openly hostile to Dominicans of color, and incidents of unprovoked violence against black Dominicans and migrants in the towns proliferated. Perhaps because of the fright that Spain would seek to make Santo Domingo an enslaved twin of Cuba, Dominicans were said to fight like \"supernatural fiends\" with a \"desperate\" intensity. By early 1864, the Spanish army, unable to contain guerrilla resistance, had suffered 1,000 killed in action and 9,000 dead from disease. Spanish colonial authorities encouraged Queen Isabella II to abandon the island, seeing the occupation as a nonsensical waste of troops and money. However, the rebels were in a state of political disarray and proved unable to present a cohesive set of demands. The first president of the provisional government, Pepillo Salcedo (allied with B\u00e1ez) was deposed by General Gaspar Polanco in September 1864, who, in turn, was deposed by General Antonio Pimentel three months later. The rebels formalized their provisional rule by holding a national convention in February 1865, which enacted a new constitution, but the new government exerted little authority over the various regional guerrilla caudillos, who were largely independent of one another.\nUnable to extract concessions from the disorganized rebels, when the American Civil War ended, in March 1865, Queen Isabella annulled the annexation and independence was restored, with the last Spanish troops departing by July. More than 7,000 Dominicans perished in battles and epidemics. Relations between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were tense once the new Dominican government came to power since Haitian President Fabre Geffrard had refused to support the independence movement out of fear of Spanish reprisals. Within three years after fighting ended in Santo Domingo, uprisings began in both remaining Spanish colonies. In both islands, Dominican veterans joined the independence fight. Within the decade, Spanish colonialism began to crumble, and rebels won emancipation.\n\n\n== Restoration: Second Republic 1865\u20131916 ==\n\n\n=== Second Republic ===\nBy the time the Spanish departed, most of the main towns lay in ruins and the island was divided among several dozen caudillos. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral controlled most of Barahona and the southwest with the support of B\u00e1ez's mahogany-exporting partners, while cattle rancher Ces\u00e1reo Guillermo assembled a coalition of former Santanista generals in the southeast, and Gregorio Luper\u00f3n controlled the north coast. Once the Spanish were vanquished, the numerous military and guerrilla leaders began to fight among themselves. From the Spanish withdrawal to 1879, there were twenty-one changes of government and at least fifty military uprisings. Haiti served as a haven for Dominican political exiles and a base of operations for insurgents, often with the support of the Haitian government, during the frequent civil wars and revolutions of the period.\nIn the course of these conflicts, two parties emerged. The Partido Rojo (Literally \"Red Party\") represented the southern cattle ranching latifundia and mahogany-exporting interests, as well as the artisans and laborers of Santo Domingo, and was dominated by B\u00e1ez, who continued to seek annexation by a foreign power. The Partido Azul (literally \"Blue Party\"), led by Luper\u00f3n, represented the tobacco farmers and merchants of the Cibao and Puerto Plata and was nationalist and liberal in orientation. During these wars, the small and corrupt national army was far outnumbered by militias organized and maintained by local caudillos who set themselves up as provincial governors. These militias were filled out by poor farmers or landless plantation workers impressed into service who usually took up banditry when not fighting in revolution.\n\nWithin a month of the nationalist victory, Cabral, whose troops were the first to enter Santo Domingo, ousted Pimentel, but a few weeks later General Guillermo led a rebellion in support of B\u00e1ez, forcing Cabral to resign and allowing B\u00e1ez to retake the presidency in October. B\u00e1ez was overthrown by the Cibao farmers under Luper\u00f3n, leader of the Partido Azul, the following spring, but Luper\u00f3n's allies turned on each other and Cabral reinstalled himself as president in a coup in 1867. After bringing several Azules (\"Blues\") into his cabinet the Rojos (\"Reds\") revolted, returning B\u00e1ez to power. In 1869, B\u00e1ez negotiated a treaty of annexation with the United States. Supported by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, who hoped to establish a Navy base at Saman\u00e1, in 1871 the treaty was defeated in the United States Senate through the efforts of abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner.In 1874, the Rojo governor of Puerto Plata, Ignacio Maria Gonz\u00e1lez Sant\u00edn, staged a coup in support of an Azul rebellion but was deposed by the Azules two years later. In February 1876, Ulises Espaillat, backed by Luper\u00f3n, was named President, but ten months later troops loyal to B\u00e1ez returned him to power. One year a new rebellion allowed Gonz\u00e1lez to seize power, only to be deposed by Ces\u00e1reo Guillermo in September 1878, who was in turn deposed by Luper\u00f3n in December 1879. Ruling the country from his hometown of Puerto Plata, enjoying an economic boom due to increased tobacco exports to Germany, Luper\u00f3n enacted a new constitution setting a two-year presidential term limit and providing for direct elections, suspended the semi-formal system of bribes and initiated construction on the nation's first railroad, linking the town of La Vega with the port of S\u00e1nchez on Saman\u00e1 Bay.\nThe Ten Years' War in Cuba brought Cuban sugar planters to the country in search of new lands and security from the insurrection that freed their slaves and destroyed their property. Most settled in the southeastern coastal plain, and, with assistance from Luper\u00f3n's government, built the nation's first mechanized sugar mills. They were later joined by Italians, Germans, Puerto Ricans and Americans in forming the nucleus of the Dominican sugar bourgeoisie, marrying into prominent families to solidify their social position. Disruptions in global production caused by the Ten Years' War, the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War allowed the Dominican Republic to become a major sugar exporter. Over the following two decades, sugar surpassed tobacco as the leading export, with the former fishing hamlets of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds and La Romana transformed into thriving ports. To meet their need for better transportation, over 300 miles of private rail-lines were built by and serving the sugar plantations by 1897. An 1884 slump in prices led to a wage freeze, and a subsequent labor shortage was filled by migrant workers from the Leeward Islands\u2014the Virgin Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and Antigua (referred to by Dominicans as cocolos). These English-speaking blacks were often victims of racism, but many remained in the country, finding work as stevedores and in railroad construction and sugar refineries.\nPuerto Ricans were imported to work under near-slave conditions on Puerto Rican-owned sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic, in the area of La Romana, during the nineteenth century. Others worked in coffee fields. Arabs began to arrive in the Dominican Republic during the latter part of the nineteenth century. They were widely accused of being dirty and of having bad manners and habits, and the government was reproached for having allowed these immigrants into the nation. Since upper-class Dominicans refused to give membership to wealthy Arabs to their private clubs like the exclusive Club de Uni\u00f3n, the Arabs created their own. During the U.S. occupation of 1916\u201324, peasants from the countryside, called Gavilleros, would not only kill U.S. Marines, but would also attack and kill Arab vendors traveling through the countryside.\n\n\n=== Ulises Heureaux and U.S. protectorate ===\nAllying with the emerging sugar interests, the dictatorship of General Ulises Heureaux, who was popularly known as Lil\u00eds, brought unprecedented stability to the island through an iron-fisted rule that lasted almost two decades. The son of a Haitian father and a mother from St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Lil\u00eds was distinguished by his blackness from most Dominican political leaders, with the exception of Luper\u00f3n. He served as President 1882\u20131883, 1887, and 1889\u20131899, wielding power through a series of puppet presidents when not occupying the office. Incorporating both Rojos and Azules into his government, he developed an extensive network of spies and informants to crush potential opposition. His government undertook a number of major infrastructure projects, including the electrification of Santo Domingo, the beginning of telephone and telegraph service, the construction of a bridge over the Ozama River, and the completion of a single-track railroad linking Santiago and Puerto Plata, financed by the Amsterdam-based Westendorp Co.Lil\u00eds's dictatorship was dependent upon heavy borrowing from European and American banks to enrich himself, stabilize the existing debt, strengthen the bribe system, pay for the army, finance infrastructural development and help set up sugar mills. However, sugar prices underwent a steep decline in the last two decades of the 19th century. When the Westendorp Co. went bankrupt in 1893, he was forced to mortgage the nation's customs fees, the main source of government revenues, to a New York financial firm called the San Domingo Improvement Co. (SDIC), which took over its railroad contracts and the claims of its European bondholders in exchange for two loans, one of $1.2 million and the other of \u00a32 million. As the growing public debt made it impossible to maintain his political machine, Heureaux relied on secret loans from the SDIC, sugar planters and local merchants. In 1897, with his government virtually bankrupt, Lil\u00eds printed five million uninsured pesos, known as papeletas de Lil\u00eds, ruining most Dominican merchants and inspiring a conspiracy that ended in his death. In 1899, when Lil\u00eds was assassinated by the Cibao tobacco merchants whom he had been begging for a loan, the national debt was over $35 million, fifteen times the annual budget.\n\nThe six years after Lil\u00eds's death witnessed four revolutions and five different presidents. The Cibao politicians who had conspired against Heureaux\u2014Juan Isidro Jimenes, the nation's wealthiest tobacco planter, and General Horacio V\u00e1squez\u2014after being named President and Vice-President, quickly fell out over the division of spoils among their supporters, the Jimenistas and Horacistas. Troops loyal to V\u00e1squez overthrew Jimenes in 1903, but V\u00e1squez was deposed by Jimenista General Alejandro Woss y Gil, who seized power for himself. The Jimenistas toppled his government, but their leader, Carlos Morales, refused to return power to Jimenes, allying with the Horacistas, and he soon faced a new revolt by his betrayed Jimenista allies.\nIn 1904, American warships bombarded insurgents in Santo Domingo for insulting the United States flag and damaging an American steamer.With the nation on the brink of defaulting, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands sent warships to Santo Domingo to press the claims of their nationals. In order to preempt military intervention, United States president Theodore Roosevelt introduced the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would assume responsibility for ensuring that the nations of Latin America met their financial obligations. In January 1905, under this corollary, the United States assumed administration of the Dominican Republic's customs. Under the terms of this agreement, a Receiver-General, appointed by the U.S. President, kept 55% of total revenues to pay off foreign claimants, while remitting 45% to the Dominican government. After two years, the nation's external debt was reduced from $40 million to $17 million. In 1907, this agreement was converted into a treaty, transferring control over customs receivership to the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs and providing a loan of $20 million from a New York bank as payment for outstanding claims, making the United States the Dominican Republic's only foreign creditor. In 1905, the Dominican Peso was replaced by the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn 1906, Morales resigned, and Horacista vice-president Ramon C\u00e1ceres became president. After suppressing a rebellion in the northwest by Jimenista General Desiderio Arias, his government brought political stability and renewed economic growth, aided by new American investment in the sugar industry. However, his assassination in 1911, for which Morales and Arias were at least indirectly responsible, once again plunged the republic into chaos. For two months, executive power was held by a civilian junta dominated by the chief of the army, General Alfredo Victoria. The surplus of more than 4 million pesos left by C\u00e1ceres was quickly spent to suppress a series of insurrections. He forced Congress to elect his uncle, Eladio Victoria, as President, but the latter was soon replaced by the neutral Archbishop Adolfo Nouel. After four months, Nouel resigned and was succeeded by Horacista Congressman Jos\u00e9 Bordas Valdez, who aligned with Arias and the Jimenistas to maintain power.  In 1913, V\u00e1squez returned from exile in Puerto Rico to lead a new rebellion. In June 1914 U.S. President Woodrow Wilson issued an ultimatum for the two sides to end hostilities and agree on a new president, or have the United States impose one. After the provisional presidency of Ram\u00f3n B\u00e1ez, Jimenes was elected in October, and soon faced new demands, including the appointment of an American director of public works and financial advisor and the creation of a new military force commanded by U.S. officers. The Dominican Congress rejected these demands and began impeachment proceedings against Jimenes. The United States occupied Haiti in July 1915, with the implicit threat that the Dominican Republic might be next. Jimenes's Minister of War Desiderio Arias staged a coup d'\u00e9tat in April 1916, providing a pretext for the United States to occupy the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n== United States occupation: 1916\u20131924 ==\n\n\n=== Conventional campaign ===\nUnited States Marines landed in Santo Domingo on May 15, 1916. Prior to their landing, Jimenes resigned, refusing to exercise an office \"regained with foreign bullets\". On June 1, Marines occupied Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata. They occupied Monte Cristi without meeting resistance, but at Puerto Plata they had to fight their way into the city under heavy but inaccurate fire from about 500 pro-Arias irregulars. During this landing the Marines sustained several casualties, including the death of Captain Herbert J. Hirshinger, the first Marine killed in combat in the Dominican campaign. Insurgent losses, while never accurately determined, were light.\nA column of Marines under Colonel Joseph H. Pendleton marched toward Santiago de los Caballeros, where rebel forces had established a government. Along the way, Dominicans tore up the railroad tracks, forcing Marines to walk. They also burned bridges, delaying the march. Twenty-four miles into the march, the Marines encountered Las Trencheras, two fortified ridges the Dominicans had long thought invulnerable: the Spanish had been defeated there in 1864. At 08:00 hours on June 27, Pendleton ordered his artillery to pound the ridgeline. Machine guns offered covering fire. A bayonet attack cleared the first ridge. Rifle fire removed the rebels who were threatening from atop the second. The significance of this battle lies in the fact that this was the first experience of Marines advancing with the support of modern artillery and machine guns.\nA week later, the Marines encountered another entrenched rebel force at Guayacanas. The rebels kept up single-shot fire against the automatic weapons of the Marines before the Marines drove them off. The battle was important in the history of the 4th Marines insofar as the regiment subsequently acquired its first Medal of Honor recipient. First Sergeant Roswell Winans, while manning his machine gun, displayed such exceptional valor that he was later awarded the nation's highest military honor. Sergeant Winans obtained his award for the bravado that he demonstrated when for a time he single-handedly raked enemy lines with his weapon. Then, when the gun jammed, he set about clearing it in full view of the Dominicans without regard to his personal safety. With his supporters defeated, Arias surrendered on July 5 in exchange for being pardoned.At San Francisco de Macor\u00eds, Governor Juan P\u00e9rez, a supporter of Arias, refused to recognize the U.S. military government. Using some 300 released prisoners, he was preparing to defend the old Spanish colonial structure, the Fortazela. On November 29 U.S. Marine Lt. Ernest C. Williams, whose detachment was billeted in San Francisco, charged the closing gates of the fort at nightfall with a dozen Marines. Eight were shot down; the others, including Williams, forced their way in and seized the old structure. Another Marine detachment seized the police station. Reinforcements from nearby detachments soon suppressed the uprising. The Marine Corps' subsequent efforts at \"state-building\", as it is commonly known today, received little assistance from Dominicans. Dominican elites, animated by nationalist resentment of the takeover of their country, refused to help the foreigners restructure their government and society.\n\n\n=== Occupation ===\n\nThe Dominican Congress elected Dr. Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal as President, but in November, after he refused to meet the U.S. demands, Wilson announced the imposition of a U.S. military government, with Rear Admiral Harry Shepard Knapp as Military Governor. The American military government implemented many of the institutional reforms carried out in the United States during the Progressive Era, including reorganization of the tax system, accounting and administration, expansion of primary education, the creation of a nationwide police force to unify the country, and the construction of a national system of roads, including a highway linking Santiago to Santo Domingo.\nDespite the reforms, virtually all Dominicans resented the loss of their sovereignty to foreigners, few of whom spoke Spanish or displayed much real concern for the nation's welfare, and the military government, unable to win the backing of any prominent Dominican political leaders, imposed strict censorship laws and imprisoned critics of the occupation. In 1920, U.S. authorities enacted a Land Registration Act, which broke up the terrenos comuneros and dispossessed thousands of peasants who lacked formal titles to the lands they occupied, while legalizing false titles held by the sugar companies. In the southeast, dispossessed peasants formed armed bands, called gavilleros, waging a guerrilla war that lasted six years, with most of the fighting in Hato Mayor and El Seibo. At any given time, the Marines faced eight to twelve such bands each composed of several hundred followers. The guerrillas benefited from a superior knowledge of the terrain and the support of the local population, and the Marines relied on increasingly brutal counterinsurgency methods. However, rivalries between various gavilleros often led them to fight against one another, and even cooperate with occupation authorities. In addition, cultural schisms between the campesinos (i.e. rural people, or peasants) and city dwellers prevented the guerrillas from cooperating with the urban middle-class nationalist movement.\nThe most notorious rebel of Seibo was a daring Dominican bandit with the nom de guerre of Vicentico Evangelista. In March 1917 he brutally executed two American civilians, engineers from an American-owned plantation, who were lashed to trees, savagely hacked with machetes, then left dangling for ravenous wild boars. He led Marine pursuers on a merry chase before surrendering on July 5 of that year. Two days later Vicentico was shot and killed by Marines \"while trying to escape\". On August 13, 1918, a five-man Marine patrol was ambushed near Manchado; four Marines were killed and the survivor wounded. By 1919 the Marines had received radios that made it easier to coordinate their efforts and six Curtiss \"Jenny\" biplanes that allowed them to expand the reach of their patrolling and even to bomb some guerrilla outposts. The unrest in the eastern provinces lasted until 1922 when the guerrillas finally agreed to surrender in return for amnesty. During the course of the campaign between 1916 and 1922, the Marines claim to have killed or wounded 1,137 \"bandits\", while 20 Marines were killed and 67 wounded. (Forty U.S. sailors died separately when a hurricane wrecked their ship on Santo Domingo's rocky shore.)\nIn the San Juan valley, near the border with Ha\u00efti, followers of a Vodu faith healer named Liborio resisted the occupation and aided the Haitian cacos in their war against the Americans, until his death in 1922. When the Haitian and Dominican forces began to fight the U.S. interventions, they suffered immensely due to the superiority of U.S. training and technology. They were poorly armed and a \"minority of them carried old-model black-powder rifles; the majority went into battle with swords, machetes, and pikes.\" The obsolete weapons as well as the lack of training and institutional control over the regional armed forces ensured American military preeminence in the region.\n\nIn what was referred to as la danza de los millones, with the destruction of European sugar-beet farms during World War I, sugar prices rose to their highest level in history, from $5.50 in 1914 to $22.50 per pound in 1920. Dominican sugar exports increased from 122,642 tons in 1916 to 158,803 tons in 1920, earning a record $45.3 million. However, European beet sugar production quickly recovered, which, coupled with the growth of global sugar cane production, glutted the world market, causing prices to plummet to only $2.00 by the end of 1921. This crisis drove many of the local sugar planters into bankruptcy, allowing large U.S. conglomerates to dominate the sugar industry. By 1926, only twenty-one major estates remained, occupying an estimated 520,000 acres (2,100 km2). Of these, twelve U.S.-owned companies owned more than 81% of this total area. While the foreign planters who had built the sugar industry integrated into Dominican society, these corporations expatriated their profits to the United States. As prices declined, sugar estates increasingly relied on Haitian laborers. This was facilitated by the military government's introduction of regulated contract labor, the growth of sugar production in the southwest, near the Haitian border, and a series of strikes by cocolo cane cutters organized by the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\n\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n\nIn the 1920 United States presidential election Republican candidate Warren Harding criticized the occupation and promised eventual U.S. withdrawal. While Jimenes and V\u00e1squez sought concessions from the United States, the collapse of sugar prices discredited the military government and gave rise to a new nationalist political organization, the Dominican National Union, led by Dr. Henr\u00edquez from exile in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, which demanded unconditional withdrawal. They formed alliances with frustrated nationalists in Puerto Rico and Cuba, as well as critics of the occupation in the United States itself, most notably The Nation and the Haiti-San Domingo Independence Society. In May 1922, a Dominican lawyer, Francisco Peynado, went to Washington, D.C. and negotiated what became known as the Hughes\u2013Peynado Plan. It stipulated the immediate establishment of a provisional government pending elections, approval of all laws enacted by the U.S. military government, and the continuation of the 1907 treaty until all the Dominican Republic's foreign debts had been settled. On October 1, Juan Bautista Vicini, the son of a wealthy Italian immigrant sugar planter, was named provisional president, and the process of U.S. withdrawal began. The principal legacy of the occupation was the creation of a National Police Force, used by the Marines to help fight against the various guerrillas, and later the main vehicle for the rise of Rafael Trujillo.\nIn contrast to the much romanticized fighting of the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill in Cuba almost two decades earlier, the Marines' anti-rebel campaigns in the Dominican Republic were hot, often godlessly uncomfortable, and largely devoid of heroism and glory.\n\n\n== The rise and fall of Trujillo: Third Republic 1924\u20131965 ==\n\n\n=== Horacio V\u00e1squez 1924\u20131930 ===\nThe occupation ended in 1924, with a democratically elected government under president V\u00e1squez. The V\u00e1squez administration brought great social and economic prosperity to the country and respected political and civil rights. Rising export commodity prices and government borrowing allowed the funding of public works projects and the expansion and modernization of Santo Domingo.Though considered to be a relatively principled man, V\u00e1squez had risen amid many years of political infighting. In a move directed against his chief opponent Federico Velasquez, in 1927 V\u00e1squez agreed to have his term extended from four to six years. The change was approved by the Dominican Congress, but was of debatable legality; \"its enactment effectively invalidated the constitution of 1924 that V\u00e1squez had previously sworn to uphold.\" V\u00e1squez also removed the prohibition against presidential reelection and postulated himself for another term in elections to be held in May 1930. However, his actions had by then led to doubts that the contest could be fair. Furthermore, these elections took place amid economic problems, as the Great Depression had dropped sugar prices to less than one dollar per pound.\nIn February, a revolution was proclaimed in Santiago by a lawyer named Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a. When the commander of the Guardia Nacional Dominicana (the new designation of the armed force created under the Occupation), Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina, ordered his troops to remain in their barracks, the sick and aging V\u00e1squez was forced into exile and Estrella proclaimed provisional president. In May, Trujillo was elected with 95% of the vote, having used the army to harass and intimidate electoral personnel and potential opponents. After his inauguration in August, at his request, the Dominican Congress proclaimed the beginning of the 'Era of Trujillo'.\n\n\n=== The era of Trujillo 1931\u20131961 ===\nTrujillo established absolute political control while promoting economic development\u2014from which mainly he and his supporters benefitted\u2014and severe repression of domestic human rights. Trujillo treated his political party, El Partido Dominicano (The Dominican Party), as a rubber-stamp for his decisions. The true source of his power was the Guardia Nacional\u2014larger, better armed, and more centrally controlled than any military force in the nation's history. By disbanding the regional militias, the Marines eliminated the main source of potential opposition, giving the Guard \"a virtual monopoly on power\". By 1940, Dominican military spending was 21% of the national budget. At the same time, he developed an elaborate system of espionage agencies. By the late 1950s, there were at least seven categories of intelligence agencies, spying on each other as well as the public. All citizens were required to carry identification cards and good-conduct passes from the secret police. Obsessed with adulation, Trujillo promoted an extravagant cult of personality. When a hurricane struck Santo Domingo in 1930, killing over 3,000 people, he rebuilt the city and renamed it Ciudad Trujillo: \"Trujillo City\"; he also renamed the country's and the Caribbean's highest mountain, Pico Duarte (Duarte Peak), Pico Trujillo. Over 1,800 statues of Trujillo were built, and all public works projects were required to have a plaque with the inscription \"Era of Trujillo, Benefactor of the Fatherland\".\n\nAs sugar estates turned to Haiti for seasonal migrant labor, increasing numbers settled in the Dominican Republic permanently. The census of 1920, conducted by the U.S. occupation government, gave a total of 28,258 Haitians living in the country; by 1935 there were 52,657. In October 1937, Trujillo ordered the  massacre of up to 38,000 Haitians, the alleged justification being Haiti's support for Dominican exiles plotting to overthrow his regime. The killings were fuelled by the racism of Dominicans, who also disdained the manual labour which Haitians performed in conditions of near-slavery. This event later became known as the Parsley Massacre because of the story that Dominican soldiers identified Haitians by their inability to pronounce the Spanish word perejil. Subsequently, during the first half of 1938, thousands more Haitians were forcibly deported and hundreds killed in the southern frontier region.So that news of the slaughter would not leak out, Trujillo clamped tight censorship on all mail and news dispatches. A shocked American missionary, Father Barnes, wrote about the massacre in a letter to his sister. It never reached her. He was found on the floor of his home, murdered brutally. But the news leaked out, stirring a decision by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba to make a joint investigation. General Hugh Johnson, a former New Deal official, made a national broadcast describing how Haitian women had been stabbed and mutilated, babies bayoneted, and men tied up and thrown into the sea to drown.\nThe massacre was the result of a new policy which Trujillo called the \"Dominicanisation of the frontier\". Place names along the border were changed from Creole and French to Spanish, the practice of Voodoo was outlawed, quotas were imposed on the percentage of foreign workers that companies could hire, and a law was passed preventing Haitian workers from remaining after the sugar harvest. Another example of repression and prejudice came about a year after Trujillo's death, in December 28, 1962, when the mainly Dominico-Haitian peasant community of Palma Sola, which challenged the racial, political, and economic situation of the country, was bombarded with napalm by the Dominican Air Force.Although Trujillo sought to emulate Generalissimo Francisco Franco, he welcomed Spanish Republican refugees following the Spanish Civil War. During the Holocaust in the Second World War, the Dominican Republic took in many Jews fleeing Hitler who had been refused entry by other countries. The Jews settled in Sosua. These decisions arose from a policy of blanquismo, closely connected with anti-Haitian xenophobia, which sought to add more light-skinned individuals to the Dominican population by promoting immigration from Europe. As part of the Good Neighbor policy, in 1940, the U.S. State Department signed a treaty with Trujillo relinquishing control over the nation's customs. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor Trujillo followed the United States in declaring war on the Axis powers, even though he had openly professed admiration for Hitler and Mussolini. During the Cold War, he maintained close ties to the United States, declaring himself the world's \"Number One Anticommunist\" and becoming the first Latin American President to sign a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with the United States. One tactical asset of the United States in the Cold War was the missile tracking system established across the region, which comprised a series of individual stations in neighboring countries. One of these stations was located in the Dominican Republic, requiring bilateral negotiations to establish the facility, and cooperation to operate it. The ranks of the U.S. military mission in the Dominican Republic swelled, as aircraft trainers and mechanics joined the attach\u00e9s of the four service branches and their staffs working at the U.S. embassy. The missile tracking station and the military mission were the strongest Cold War ties between the United States and the Dominican Republic, but they became liabilities as the relationship soured.\nSoon after the end of World War II, Trujillo constructed an arms factory at San Crist\u00f3bal. It made hand grenades, gunpowder, dynamite, revolvers, automatic rifles, carbines, submachine guns, light machine guns, antitank guns, and munitions. In addition, some quantities of mortars and aerial bombs were produced and light artillery rebuilt. Trujillo's increasingly powerful military withstood a series of invasion attempts by leftist Dominican exiles. On June 19, 1949, an airplane carrying Dominican rebels from Guatemala was intercepted and destroyed by the Dominican coastguard at Luper\u00f3n on the north coast. Ten years later, on June 14, 1959, Dominican revolutionaries launched three simultaneous attacks. At Estero Hondo and Maim\u00f3n on the north coast, the rebels followed the Castro tactic of landing from ships, but the Dominican government's air power and artillery overwhelmed the attackers as they landed. At Constanza in the high mountains near the border with Haiti, a small band of armed exiles came by air. On that occasion, the heavy bombers of the Dominican Air Force came into action but were inaccurate, hitting more civilians than guerrillas. It was Dominican peasants who tracked down and captured or killed most of the fugitives, for which they received cash bounties from Trujillo's government.\nTrujillo and his family established a near-monopoly over the national economy. By the time of his death, he had accumulated a fortune of around $800 million; he and his family owned 50\u201360% of the arable land, some 700,000 acres (2,800 km2), and Trujillo-owned businesses accounted for 80% of the commercial activity in the capital. He exploited nationalist sentiment to purchase most of the nation's sugar plantations and refineries from U.S. corporations; operated monopolies on salt, rice, milk, cement, tobacco, coffee, and insurance; owned two large banks, several hotels, port facilities, an airline and shipping line; deducted 10% of all public employees' salaries (ostensibly for his party); and received a portion of prostitution revenues. World War II brought increased demand for Dominican exports, and the 1940s and early 1950s witnessed economic growth and considerable expansion of the national infrastructure. During this period, the capital city was transformed from merely an administrative center to the national center of shipping and industry, although \"it was hardly coincidental that new roads often led to Trujillo's plantations and factories, and new harbors benefited Trujillo's shipping and export enterprises.\"Mismanagement and corruption resulted in major economic problems. By the end of the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and a decision to make a major investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda de Gal\u00edndez, a Basque exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In June 1960, Dominican secret police agents in Caracas used a car bomb in a nearly successful attempt to kill President R\u00f3mulo Betancourt of Venezuela, who had become the leading voice in the anti-Trujillo chorus, burning him badly. Tracing the attack to Trujillo, the Organization of American States (OAS) imposed sanctions for the first time since its creation in 1946, cutting off shipments of oil, among other things, to the Dominican Republic. Refusing to back down, Trujillo lashed out at Catholic priests who read a pastoral letter from the pulpit asking for merciful treatment of political opponents. One of his last-ditch threats was to ally with the Soviet Union, as he had implied was an option in the past.\nA group of Dominican dissidents killed Trujillo in a car chase on the way to his country villa near San Crist\u00f3bal on May 30, 1961. The sanctions remained in force after Trujillo's assassination. His son Ramfis took over the presidency and rounded up all the conspirators. They were summarily executed, some of them being fed to sharks. In November 1961, the military plot of the Rebellion of the Pilots forced the Trujillo family into exile, fleeing to France, and the heretofore puppet-president Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer assumed effective power.\n\n\n=== The post-Trujillo instability 1961\u20131965 ===\nAt the insistence of the United States, Balaguer was forced to share power with a seven-member Council of State, established on January 1, 1962, and including moderate members of the opposition. OAS sanctions were lifted January 4, and, after an attempted coup, Balaguer resigned and went into exile on January 16. The reorganized Council of State, under President Rafael Filiberto Bonnelly headed the Dominican government until elections could be held. These elections, in December 1962, were won by Juan Bosch, a scholar and poet who had founded the opposition Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (Dominican Revolutionary Party, or PRD) in exile, during the Trujillo years. His leftist policies, including land redistribution, nationalization of certain foreign holdings, and attempts to bring the military under civilian control, antagonized the military officer corps, the Catholic hierarchy, and the upper-class, who feared \"another Cuba\".\nThe Presidency of Juan Bosch in 1963 led to one of the tensest periods in contemporary Haitian-Dominican relations. Bosch supported the efforts of Haitian exiles who trained to overthrow Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, Haiti's repressive president. In April 1963, former Haitian army officers reportedly tried to kill Duvalier's children, and many of those accused took refuge in the embassies of Latin American countries in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital. When Haitian police raided the Dominican embassy and held captive 22 refugees, the Dominican Republic broke off diplomatic relations and threatened to invade Haiti. The OAS mediated the dispute and eased the tension; Dominican troops, ready to invade, pulled back from the border; and many of the refugees were granted safe conduct out of Haiti. Hostilities erupted again in September that year when both sides shelled each other across the border. The OAS again intervened to make peace.\nIn September 1963 Bosch was overthrown by a right-wing military coup led by Colonel El\u00edas Wessin and was replaced by a three-man military junta. Bosch went into exile to Puerto Rico.  Afterwards, a supposedly civilian triumvirate established a de facto dictatorship.\n\n\n== Dominican Civil War and second United States occupation 1965\u201366 ==\n\nOn April 16, 1965, growing dissatisfaction generated another military rebellion on April 24, 1965 that demanded Bosch's restoration. The insurgents, reformist officers and civilian combatants loyal to Bosch commanded by Colonel Francisco Caama\u00f1o, and who called themselves the Constitutionalists, staged a coup, seizing the national palace. Immediately, conservative military forces, led by Wessin and calling themselves Loyalists, struck back with tank assaults and aerial bombings against Santo Domingo. A few days of upheaval saw heavy fighting in the streets of the city and a pitched battle fought on the main bridge across the Ozama River, where civilians used guns supplied by their military allies to repulse the tank corps loyal to the military government, preventing it from entering the capital.\nOn April 28, these anti-Bosch army elements requested U.S. military intervention and U.S. forces landed, ostensibly to protect U.S. citizens and to evacuate U.S. and other foreign nationals. U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, convinced of the defeat of the Loyalist forces and fearing the creation of \"a second Cuba\" on America's doorstep, ordered U.S. forces to restore order. In what was initially known as Operation Power Pack, 27,677 U.S. troops were ultimately ordered to the Dominican Republic. The 4th Marine Expeditionary Force and the army's 82nd Airborne Division spearheaded the occupation. Psychological Warfare and Special Forces units also took part in the action.\nDenied a military victory, the Constitutionalist rebels quickly had a Constitutionalist congress elect Caama\u00f1o president of the country. U.S. officials countered by backing General Antonio Imbert. On May 7, Imbert was sworn in as president of the Government of National Reconstruction. The next step in the stabilization process, as envisioned by Washington and the OAS, was to arrange an agreement between President Caama\u00f1o and President Imbert to form a provisional government committed to early elections. However, Caama\u00f1o refused to meet with Imbert until several of the Loyalist officers, including Wessin y Wessin, were made to leave the country. On 13 May General Imbert launched an eight-day offensive to eliminate rebel resistance north of the line of communications. During the attack, U.S. troops shot down one of the new government's five P-51 Mustangs when it accidentally strafed their position. Imbert's forces took the northern part of the capital, destroying many buildings and killing many black civilians. The United Nations dispatched a human rights team to investigate alleged atrocities.\n\nBy May 14 the Americans had established a \"safety corridor\" connecting the San Isidro Air Base and the \"Duarte\" Bridge to the Embajador Hotel and United States Embassy in the center of Santo Domingo, essentially sealing off the Constitutionalist area of Santo Domingo. Roadblocks were established and patrols ran continuously. Some 6,500 people from many nations were evacuated to safety. In addition, the US forces airlifted in relief supplies for Dominican nationals.\nBy mid-May, a majority of the OAS voted for Operation \"Push Ahead\", the reduction of United States forces and their replacement by an Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF). The Inter-American Peace Force was formally established on May 23. The following troops were sent by each country: Brazil \u2013 1,130, Honduras \u2013 250, Paraguay \u2013 184, Nicaragua \u2013 160, Costa Rica \u2013 21 military police, and El Salvador \u2013 3 staff officers. The first contingent to arrive was a rifle company from Honduras which was soon backed by detachments from Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Brazil provided the largest unit, a reinforced infantry battalion. Brazilian General Hugo Panasco Alvim assumed command of the OAS ground forces, and on 26 May the U.S. forces began to withdraw.\nOn 15 June the rebels launched their final attempt to escape their Ciudad Nuevo stronghold. Camaa\u00f1o hurled all his best remaining units and weapons against the American lines, and soon mortar rounds were hitting the 82nd Airborne Division. Although their heaviest weapons were recoilless cannons, the 82nd Airborne soundly defeated the rebels. The fighting cost the U.S. five killed and thirty-one wounded, three of whom later died. The Brazilians, who had orders to remain on the defensive, suffered five wounded.\nThe mauling the Constitutionalists received on the 15th made them more amenable, but not yet committed, to a negotiated settlement. The fighting continued until August 31, 1965, when a truce was declared. Most American troops left shortly afterwards as policing and peacekeeping operations were turned over to Brazilian troops, but some U.S. military presence remained until September 1966. A total of 44 American soldiers died, 27 in action. 172 were wounded in action, as were six Brazilians and five Paraguayans. An estimated 6,000 to 10,000 Dominicans died, many of them civilians killed when the Dominican Air Force bombed their crowded Santo Domingo neighborhoods prior to the U.S. invasion.\n\n\n== Fourth Republic 1966\u2013present ==\n\n\n=== Balaguer's second Presidency 1966\u20131978 ===\nIn June 1966, Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, leader of the Reformist Party (which later became the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), was elected and then re-elected to office in May 1970 and May 1974, both times after the major opposition parties withdrew late in the campaign because of the high degree of violence by pro-government groups. On November 28, 1966 a constitution was created, signed, and put into effect. The constitution stated that the president was elected to a four-year term. If there was a close election there would be a second round of voting to decide the winner. The voting age was eighteen, but married people under eighteen could also vote.\nRemnants of the constitutionalist movement and some scattered groups of the Dominican left started to plan for a revolution and in February 1973 Caama\u00f1o suddenly landed on a desolate beach in the southwest. Together with a small group of just ten men he made it for the mountains which they intended to make into a center for a campaign against the government of Balaguer. They were soon traced and hunted down by a party of 2,000 men, while 1,400 political, student and labor leaders were arrested all over the country. After two weeks Caama\u00f1o and his men were ambushed between Constanza and San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa and there the wounded and captured Francisco Alberto Caama\u00f1o De\u00f1\u00f3 was shot in the head by his captors.\nBalaguer led the Dominican Republic through a thorough economic restructuring, based on opening the country to foreign investment while protecting state-owned industries and certain private interests. This distorted, dependent development model produced uneven results. For most of Balaguer's first nine years in office the country experienced high growth rates (e.g., an average GDP growth rate of 9.4% between 1970 and 1975), to the extent that people talked about the \"Dominican miracle\". Foreign, mostly U.S. investment, as well as foreign aid, flowed into the country. Sugar, then the country's main export product, enjoyed good prices in the international market, and tourism grew tremendously.\nHowever, this excellent macroeconomic performance was not accompanied by an equitable distribution of wealth. While a group of new millionaires flourished during Balaguer's administrations, the poor simply became poorer. Moreover, the poor were commonly the target of state repression, and their socioeconomic claims were labeled 'communist' and dealt with accordingly by the state security apparatus. In the May 1978 election, Balaguer was defeated in his bid for a fourth successive term by Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez of the PRD. Balaguer then ordered troops to storm the election centre and destroy ballot boxes, declaring himself the victor. U.S. President Jimmy Carter refused to recognize Balaguer's claim, and, faced with the loss of foreign aid, Balaguer stepped down.\n\n\n=== Guzm\u00e1n / Blanco interregnum 1978\u20131986 ===\nGuzm\u00e1n's inauguration on August 16 marked the country's first peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to another. By the late 1970s, economic expansion slowed considerably as sugar prices declined and oil prices rose. Rising inflation and unemployment diminished support for the government and helped trigger a wave of mass emigration from the Dominican Republic to New York, coming on the heels of the similar migration of Puerto Ricans in the preceding decades.\nElections were again held in 1982. Salvador Jorge Blanco of the Dominican Revolutionary Party defeated Bosch and a resurgent Balaguer.\n\n\n=== Balaguer's third Presidency 1986\u20131996 ===\nBalaguer completed his return to power in 1986 when he won the Presidency again and remained in office for the next ten years. Elections in 1990 were marked by violence and suspected electoral fraud. The 1994 election too saw widespread pre-election violence, often aimed at intimidating members of the opposition. Balaguer won in 1994 but most observers felt the election had been stolen. Under pressure from the United States, Balaguer agreed to hold new elections in 1996. He himself would not run.\n\n\n=== Since 1996 ===\n\n\n=== Fern\u00e1ndez: First administration 1996\u20132000 ===\nIn 1996, U.S.-raised Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez Reyna  of Bosch's Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (Dominican Liberation Party) secured more than 51% of the vote, through an alliance with Balaguer. The first item on the president's agenda was the partial sale of some state-owned enterprises. Fern\u00e1ndez was praised for ending decades of isolationism and improving ties with other Caribbean countries, but he was criticized for not fighting corruption or alleviating the poverty that affected 60% of the population.\n\n\n=== Mej\u00eda's administration 2000\u20132004 ===\nIn May 2000 the center-left Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda of the PRD was elected president amid popular discontent over power outages in the recently privatized electric industry. His presidency saw major inflation and instability of the peso in 2003 because of the bankruptcy of three major commercial banks in the country due to the bad policies of the principal managers. During his remaining time as president, he took action to save most savers of the closed banks, avoiding a major crisis. The relatively stable currency fell from about 16 Dominican pesos to 1 United States dollar to about 60 DOP to US$1 and was in the 40s to the dollar when he left office in August 2004. In the May 2004 presidential elections, he was defeated by former president Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\n=== Fern\u00e1ndez: Second administration 2004\u20132012 ===\nFern\u00e1ndez instituted austerity measures to deflate the peso and rescue the country from its economic crisis, and in the first half of 2006, the economy grew 11.7%. The peso is currently (2019) at the exchange rate of c. 52 DOP to US$1.\nOver the last three decades, remittances (remesas) from Dominicans living abroad, mainly in the United States, have become increasingly important to the economy. From 1990 to 2000, the Dominican population of the U.S. doubled in size, from 520,121 in 1990 to 1,041,910, two-thirds of whom were born in the Dominican Republic itself. More than half of all Dominican Americans live in New York City, with the largest concentration in the neighborhood of Washington Heights in northern Manhattan. Over the past decade, the Dominican Republic has become the largest source of immigration to New York City, and today the metropolitan area of New York has a larger Dominican population than any city except Santo Domingo. Dominican communities have also developed in New Jersey (particularly Paterson), Miami, Boston, Philadelphia, Providence, Rhode Island, and Lawrence, Massachusetts. In addition, tens of thousands of Dominicans and their descendants live in Puerto Rico. Many Dominicans arrive in Puerto Rico illegally by sea across the Mona Passage, some staying and some moving on to the mainland U.S. (See Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico.) Dominicans living abroad sent an estimated $3 billion in remittances to relatives at home, in 2006. In 1997, a new law took effect, allowing Dominicans living abroad to retain their citizenship and vote in presidential elections. President Fern\u00e1ndez, who grew up in New York, was the principal beneficiary of this law.\nThe Dominican Republic was involved in the US-led coalition in Iraq, as part of the Spain-led Latin-American Plus Ultra Brigade. But in 2004, the nation pulled its 300 or so troops out of Iraq.\n\n\n=== Danilo Medina: 2012\u2013present ===\nDanilo Medina began his tenure with a series of controversial tax reforms so as to deal with the government's troublesome fiscal situation encountered by the new administration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Haiti\nHistory of Latin America\nHistory of North America\nHistory of the Americas\nHistory of the Caribbean\nList of Presidents of the Dominican Republic\nPolitics of the Dominican Republic\nSpanish colonization of the Americas\nTimeline of Santo Domingo (city)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDerby, Robin.

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports. Aeropuerto Internacional La Isabela a newly constructed airport located in the northern section of the city, within kilometres of the city center. It serves mostly domestic and charter flights. The major international airport that serves the city is Santo Domingo Las Americas, which serves North, Central and South America and also Europe.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nThe Port of Santo Domingo is located on the Ozama River. Its location at the center of the Caribbean is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\nThe port's renovation is part of a major redevelopment project, aimed at integrating the port area and the Zona Colonial and foster a cruise, yacht, and high-end tourism destination. Supported by legislation approved in 2005, the project, developed by the Sans Souci Group, also includes the development of a new sports marina and a 122-acre (0.49 km2) mixed-leisure real estate development adjacent to the port.\n\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\nSanto Domingo is the terminus for four of the five national highways. The city is connected to the southwest of the country by the national highway DR-2 (Avenida George Washington and Autopista 30 de Mayo), and with the cities of the country's northwest by DR-1 (Expreso Kennedy, Corredor Duarte), which serves as a direct link to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros. DR-3 (Expreso 27 de Febrero/Autopista de Las Am\u00e9ricas) connects Santo Domingo directly to the east of the country, including the cities of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, La Romana, and major tourist sites such as Punta Cana and B\u00e1varo, and to the Saman\u00e1 Province (in the northeast) via the Samana Highway. In the city, motoconchos (motorcycle taxis), guaguas/voladoras (low quality public buses), and carros p\u00fablicos/conchos (shared taxis) are common modes of transport. The Santo Domingo Metro is the highest quality in the region of the Caribbean and Central America. It is composed of 2 lines that cross the city.\n\n\n=== Main avenues ===\nExpreso John F. Kennedy: This expressway crosses the National District from east to west in the north-central part. The Avenue consists of a total of ten lanes, five on each side. The two center lanes of the road are express lanes to facilitate transit. It also has several bypasses and elevated crossings.\n\nAvenida 27 de Febrero: It is the main avenue to cross the National District from east to west in the central part of Santo Domingo. It starts at the Juan Bosch bridge and crosses the entire city until the roundabout at the Plaza de la Bandera, which extends into the town of Santo Domingo West and ends on the Duarte Highway.

        "wiki": "La Puerta del Conde (The Count's Gate) was the main entrance to the fortified city of Santo Domingo (in present-day Dominican Republic), named to honor Governor Captain-General Bernardino de Meneses Bracamonte y Zapata, 1st Count of Pe\u00f1alva, who during his tenure saved the city from a siege in 1655 by Englishmen General Robert Venables and Admiral William Penn amid the Third Anglo-Spanish War.\nThe gate is part of a structure called El Baluarte del Conde (The Count's Bulwark), a fort in Ciudad Colonial, the colonial area of Santo Domingo. The fort was part of a larger system of fortifications that ran along a defensive wall which surrounded Ciudad Colonial. The Altar of the Fatherland and Independence Park are located there.\nFrancisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez, one of the Dominican Founding Fathers, proclaimed Dominican independence and raised the first Dominican Flag, on February 27, 1844.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial era ===\nThe construction of this site began in 1543 and the site was originally named Fort San Genaro. It was designed to defend Santo Domingo from invading armies and attacks by pirates and corsairs.The murralla (defensive wall) was modified in 1655 after the English, led by William Penn and Robert Venables, undertook the Siege of Santo Domingo. The invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe\u00f1alva. Due to his valor, the site was named in his honor La Puerta del Conde. The muralla was appended to Fort San Genaro and the structures became indistinguishable and known since 1655 as La Puerta del Conde.El Baluarte del Conde was a typical model of the school of 17th-century bastion fortresses of Italian influence, which are preserved in the Caribbean as a major legacy of 17th-century fortifications. The city's defensive wall reached its full footprint by about the 18th century with the addition of various defensive structures, effectively enclosing Colonial Santo Domingo in a pentagonal wall. La Puerta del Conde was the western entrance into Colonial Santo Domingo. Not much remains of the defensive walls which once surrounded the entire city, except for several sections with gates and forts, including: La Puerta del Conde, La Puerta de la Misericordia, Fuerte San Jose, Fuerte Santa Barbara, Fuerte San Gil, etc.\n\n\n== Contemporary Dominican Republic ==\nToday, La Puerta del Conde serves as the main entrance to El Parque Nacional (The National Park), also referred to as Independence Park. Inscribed above the arch of La Puerta del Conde is \"\u1ec9Dulce et Decori est pro patria mori\u1e2f\", in Latin, which means \"It is indeed sweet and honorable to die for the fatherland\". El Baluarte del Conde is a symbol of independence and contains several monuments and structures which attest to the Dominican struggle for freedom. It is common to refer to the fort as La Puerta del Conde/Parque Nacional, being that these are the two most visible and relevant symbols of the Dominican Republic; the park is where the Altar de la Patria (the Altar of the Fatherland) is located.\n\n\n=== Parque Independencia ===\nEl Parque Independencia (Independence Park) is a historic park within the confines of El Baluarte del Conde so named because it contains the site where Dominican independence was proclaimed in 1844. The Altar de la Patria (see below) is located in the Park. Parque Independencia is nowadays only bound by a section of the original defensive wall, La Puerta del Conde. In 1912, the Park was redesigned by architect Antonin Nechodoma to its present state; no longer was there a street passing through the park. This redesign later facilitated the construction of the Altar de la Patria.\n\n\n=== Altar de la Patria ===\n\nThe Altar de la Patria, or Altar of the Fatherland, is a mausoleum made of white marble, built in 1976. The Altar houses the remains of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic: Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez, and Mat\u00edas Ram\u00f3n Mella, collectively known as Los Trinitarios. Within the mausoleum there are statues of the founding fathers, carved by Italian sculptor Nicholas Arrighini, and there is also an \"eternal flame\" that is kept lit in memory of the patriots.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Dominican Republic\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s de Monroy y Pizarro Altamirano, 1st Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca (; Spanish: [e\u027e\u02c8na\u014b ko\u027e\u02c8tes \u00f0e mon\u02c8roj i pi\u02c8\u03b8aro altami'\u027eano]; 1485 \u2013 December 2, 1547) was a Spanish Conquistador who led an expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec Empire and brought large portions of what is now mainland Mexico under the rule of the King of Castile in the early 16th century. Cort\u00e9s was part of the generation of Spanish explorers and conquistadors who began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas.\nBorn in Medell\u00edn, Spain, to a family of lesser nobility, Cort\u00e9s chose to pursue adventure and riches in the New World. He went to Hispaniola and later to Cuba, where he received an encomienda (the right to the labor of certain subjects). For a short time, he served as alcalde (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, which he partly funded. His enmity with the Governor of Cuba, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cort\u00e9s ignored.\nArriving on the continent, Cort\u00e9s executed a successful strategy of allying with some indigenous people against others. He also used a native woman, Do\u00f1a Marina, as an interpreter. She later bore his first son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cort\u00e9s, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of being punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the Aztec Empire, Cort\u00e9s was awarded the title of Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca, while the more prestigious title of Viceroy was given to a high-ranking nobleman, Antonio de Mendoza. In 1541 Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain, where he died six years later of natural causes.\nBecause of the controversial undertakings of Cort\u00e9s and the scarcity of reliable sources of information about him, it is difficult to describe his personality or motivations. Early lionizing of the conquistadores did not encourage deep examination of Cort\u00e9s. Modern reconsideration has done little to enlarge understanding regarding him. As a result of these historical trends, descriptions of Cort\u00e9s tend to be simplistic, and either damning or idealizing.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nCort\u00e9s himself used the form \"Hernando\" or \"Fernando\" for his first name, as seen in his signature and the title of an early portrait. William Hickling Prescott's Conquest of Mexico (1843) also refers to him as Hernando Cort\u00e9s. At some point writers began using the shortened form of \"Hern\u00e1n\" more generally.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCort\u00e9s was born in 1485 in the town of Medell\u00edn, then a village in the Kingdom of Castile, now a municipality of the modern-day province of Badajoz in Extremadura, Spain. His father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s de Monroy, born in 1449 to Rodrigo or Ruy Fern\u00e1ndez de Monroy and his wife Mar\u00eda Cort\u00e9s, was an infantry captain of distinguished ancestry but slender means. Hern\u00e1n's mother was Catal\u00edna Pizarro Altamirano.Through his mother, Hern\u00e1n was second cousin once removed of Francisco Pizarro, who later conquered the Inca Empire of modern-day Peru, and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro, who joined Cort\u00e9s to conquer the Aztecs. (His maternal grandmother, Leonor S\u00e1nchez Pizarro Altamirano, was first cousin of Pizarro's father Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodriguez.) Through his father, Hern\u00e1n was related to Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, the third Governor of Hispaniola. His paternal great-grandfather was Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz, 5th Lord of Monroy.\nAccording to his biographer, chaplain, and friend Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, Cort\u00e9s was pale and sickly as a child. At the age of 14, he was sent to study Latin under an uncle in Salamanca. Modern historians have misconstrued this personal tutoring as time enrolled at the University of Salamanca.After two years, Cort\u00e9s returned home to Medell\u00edn, much to the irritation of his parents, who had hoped to see him equipped for a profitable legal career. However, those two years in Salamanca, plus his long period of training and experience as a notary, first in Valladolid and later in Hispaniola, gave him knowledge of the legal codes of Castile that he applied to help justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico.At this point in his life, Cort\u00e9s was described by G\u00f3mara as ruthless, haughty, and mischievous. The 16-year-old youth had returned home to feel constrained life in his small provincial town. By this time, news of the exciting discoveries of Christopher Columbus in the New World was streaming back to Spain.\n\n\n== Early career in the New World ==\nPlans were made for Cort\u00e9s to sail to the Americas with a family acquaintance and distant relative, Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, the newly appointed Governor of Hispaniola. (This island is now divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Cort\u00e9s suffered an injury and was prevented from traveling. He spent the next year wandering the country, probably spending most of his time in Spain's southern ports of Cadiz, Palos, Sanlucar, and Seville. He finally left for Hispaniola in 1504 and became a colonist.\n\n\n=== Arrival ===\nCort\u00e9s reached Hispaniola in a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero, who tried to deceive his superiors and reach the New World before them in order to secure personal advantages. Quintero's mutinous conduct may have served as a model for Cort\u00e9s in his subsequent career. The history of the conquistadores is rife with accounts of rivalry, jockeying for positions, mutiny, and betrayal.Upon his arrival in 1504 in Santo Domingo, the capital of Hispaniola, the 18-year-old Cort\u00e9s registered as a citizen; this entitled him to a building plot and land to farm. Soon afterward, Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando granted him an encomienda and appointed him as a notary of the town of Azua de Compostela. His next five years seemed to help establish him in the colony; in 1506, Cort\u00e9s took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba. The expedition leader awarded him a large estate of land and Indian slaves for his efforts.\n\n\n=== Cuba (1511\u20131519) ===\nIn 1511, Cort\u00e9s accompanied Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, an aide of the Governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. Vel\u00e1zquez was appointed Governor of New Spain. At the age of 26, Cort\u00e9s was made clerk to the treasurer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown received the quinto, or customary one fifth of the profits from the expedition.\nVel\u00e1zquez was so impressed with Cort\u00e9s that he secured a high political position for him in the colony. He became secretary for Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Cort\u00e9s was twice appointed municipal magistrate (alcalde) of Santiago. In Cuba, Cort\u00e9s became a man of substance with an encomienda to provide Indian labor for his mines and cattle. This new position of power also made him the new source of leadership, which opposing forces in the colony could then turn to. In 1514, Cort\u00e9s led a group which demanded that more Indians be assigned to the settlers.\nAs time went on, relations between Cort\u00e9s and Governor Vel\u00e1zquez became strained. This began once news reached Vel\u00e1zquez that Juan de Grijalva had established a colony on the mainland where there was a bonanza of silver and gold, and Vel\u00e1zquez decided to send him help. Cort\u00e9s was appointed Captain-General of this new expedition in October 1518, but was advised to move fast before Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind.With Cort\u00e9s' experience as an administrator, knowledge gained from many failed expeditions, and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and 300 men, within a month. Vel\u00e1zquez's jealousy exploded and he decided to put the expedition in other hands. However, Cort\u00e9s quickly gathered more men and ships in other Cuban ports.\nCort\u00e9s also found time to become romantically involved with Catalina Xu\u00e1rez (or Ju\u00e1rez), the sister-in-law of Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Part of Vel\u00e1zquez's displeasure seems to have been based on a belief that Cort\u00e9s was trifling with Catalina's affections. Cort\u00e9s was temporarily distracted by one of Catalina's sisters but finally married Catalina, reluctantly, under pressure from Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. However, by doing so, he hoped to secure the good will of both her family and that of Vel\u00e1zquez.It was not until he had been almost 15 years in the Indies that Cort\u00e9s began to look beyond his substantial status as mayor of the capital of Cuba and as a man of affairs in the thriving colony. He missed the first two expeditions, under the orders of Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba and then Juan de Grijalva, sent by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez to Mexico in 1518.\n\n\n== Conquest of Mexico (1519\u20131521) ==\n\nIn 1518, Vel\u00e1zquez put Cort\u00e9s in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization. At the last minute, due to the old argument between the two, Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind and revoked Cort\u00e9s's charter. He ignored the orders and, in an act of open mutiny, went anyway in February 1519. He stopped in Trinidad, Cuba, to hire more soldiers and obtain more horses. Accompanied by about 11 ships, 500 men (including seasoned slaves), 13 horses, and a small number of cannons, Cort\u00e9s landed on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mayan territory. There he encountered Geronimo de Aguilar, a Spanish Franciscan priest who had survived a shipwreck followed by a period in captivity with the Maya, before escaping. Aguilar had learned the Chontal Maya language and was able to translate for Cort\u00e9s.In March 1519, Cort\u00e9s formally claimed the land for the Spanish crown. Then he proceeded to Tabasco, where he met with resistance and won a battle against the natives. He received twenty young indigenous women from the vanquished natives, and he converted them all to Christianity.Among these women was La Malinche, his future mistress and mother of his son Mart\u00edn. Malinche knew both the Nahuatl language and Chontal Maya, thus enabling Cort\u00e9s to communicate with the Aztecs through Aguilar. At San Juan de Ul\u00faa on Easter Sunday 1519, Cort\u00e9s met with Moctezuma II's Aztec Empire governors Tendile and Pitalpitoque.\n\nIn July 1519, his men took over Veracruz. By this act, Cort\u00e9s dismissed the authority of the Governor of Cuba to place himself directly under the orders of King Charles. In order to eliminate any ideas of retreat, Cort\u00e9s scuttled his ships.\n\n\n=== March on Tenochtitl\u00e1n ===\nIn Veracruz, he met some of the tributaries of the Aztecs and asked them to arrange a meeting with Moctezuma II, the tlatoani (ruler) of the Aztec Empire. Moctezuma repeatedly turned down the meeting, but Cort\u00e9s was determined. Leaving a hundred men in Veracruz, Cort\u00e9s marched on Tenochtitl\u00e1n in mid-August 1519, along with 600 soldiers, 15 horsemen, 15 cannons, and hundreds of indigenous carriers and warriors.On the way to Tenochtitl\u00e1n, Cort\u00e9s made alliances with indigenous peoples such as the Totonacs of Cempoala and the Nahuas of Tlaxcala. The Otomis initially, and then the Tlaxcalans fought with the Spanish in a series of three battles from 2 to 5 September 1519, and at one point, Diaz remarked, \"they surrounded us on every side\". After Cort\u00e9s continued to release prisoners with messages of peace, and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Moctezuma, Xicotencatl the Elder and Maxixcatzin persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader, Xicotencatl the Younger, that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.In October 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his men, accompanied by about 1,000 Tlaxcalteca, marched to Cholula, the second largest city in central Mexico. Cort\u00e9s, either in a pre-meditated effort to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him at Tenochtitlan or (as he later claimed, when he was being investigated) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza, then partially burned the city.\n \nBy the time he arrived in Tenochtitl\u00e1n the Spaniards had a large army. On November 8, 1519, they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II. Moctezuma deliberately let Cort\u00e9s enter the Aztec capital, the island city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, hoping to get to know their weaknesses better and to crush them later.Moctezuma gave lavish gifts of gold to the Spaniards which, rather than placating them, excited their ambitions for plunder. In his letters to King Charles, Cort\u00e9s claimed to have learned at this point that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl or Quetzalcoatl himself \u2013 a belief which has been contested by a few modern historians. But quickly Cort\u00e9s learned that several Spaniards on the coast had been killed by Aztecs while supporting the Totonacs, and decided to take Moctezuma as a hostage in his own palace, indirectly ruling Tenochtitl\u00e1n through him.\n\nMeanwhile, Vel\u00e1zquez sent another expedition, led by P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez, to oppose Cort\u00e9s, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men. Cort\u00e9s left 200 men in Tenochtitl\u00e1n and took the rest to confront Narv\u00e1ez. He overcame Narv\u00e1ez, despite his numerical inferiority, and convinced the rest of Narv\u00e1ez's men to join him. In Mexico, one of Cort\u00e9s's lieutenants Pedro de Alvarado, committed the massacre in the Great Temple, triggering a local rebellion.Cort\u00e9s speedily returned to Tenochtitl\u00e1n. On July 1, 1520 Moctezuma was killed (the Spaniards claimed he was stoned to death by his own people; others claim he was murdered by the Spanish once they realized his inability to placate the locals). Faced with a hostile population, Cort\u00e9s decided to flee for Tlaxcala. During the Noche Triste (June 30 \u2013 July 1, 1520), the Spaniards managed a narrow escape from Tenochtitl\u00e1n across the Tlacopan causeway, while their rearguard was being massacred. Much of the treasure looted by Cort\u00e9s was lost (as well as his artillery) during this panicked escape from Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\n\n\n=== Destruction of Tenochtitl\u00e1n ===\nAfter a battle in Otumba, they managed to reach Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men. With the assistance of their allies, Cort\u00e9s's men finally prevailed with reinforcements arriving from Cuba. Cort\u00e9s began a policy of attrition towards Tenochtitl\u00e1n, cutting off supplies and subduing the Aztecs' allied cities. During the siege he would construct brigantines  in the lake and slowly destroy blocks of the city to avoid fighting in an urban setting. The Mexicas would fall back toTlatelolco and even succeed in ambushing the pursuing Spanish forces, inflicting heavy losses, but would ultimately be the last portion of the island that resisted the conquistadores. The siege of Tenochtitl\u00e1n ended with Spanish victory and the destruction of the city.In January 1521, Cort\u00e9s countered a conspiracy against him, headed by Antonio de Villafana, who was hanged for the offense. Finally, with the capture of Cuauht\u00e9moc, the tlatoani (ruler) of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, on August 13, 1521, the Aztec Empire was captured, and Cort\u00e9s was able to claim it for Spain, thus renaming the city Mexico City. From 1521 to 1524, Cort\u00e9s personally governed Mexico.\n\n\n== Appointment to governorship of Mexico and internal dissensions ==\n\nMany historical sources have conveyed an impression that Cort\u00e9s was unjustly treated by the Spanish Crown, and that he received nothing but ingratitude for his role in establishing New Spain. This picture is the one Cort\u00e9s presents in his letters and in the later biography written by Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara. However, there may be more to the picture than this. Cort\u00e9s's own sense of accomplishment, entitlement, and vanity may have played a part in his deteriorating position with the king:\n\nCort\u00e9s personally was not ungenerously rewarded, but he speedily complained of insufficient compensation to himself and his comrades. Thinking himself beyond reach of restraint, he disobeyed many of the orders of the Crown, and, what was more imprudent, said so in a letter to the emperor, dated October 15, 1524 (Ycazbalceta, \"Documentos para la Historia de M\u00e9xico\", Mexico, 1858, I). In this letter Cort\u00e9s, besides recalling in a rather abrupt manner that the conquest of Mexico was due to him alone, deliberately acknowledges his disobedience in terms which could not fail to create a most unfavourable impression.\nKing Charles appointed Cort\u00e9s as governor, captain general and chief justice of the newly conquered territory, dubbed \"New Spain of the Ocean Sea\". But also, much to the dismay of Cort\u00e9s, four royal officials were appointed at the same time to assist him in his governing \u2013 in effect, submitting him to close observation and administration. Cort\u00e9s initiated the construction of Mexico City, destroying Aztec temples and buildings and then rebuilding on the Aztec ruins what soon became the most important European city in the Americas.Cort\u00e9s managed the founding of new cities and appointed men to extend Spanish rule to all of New Spain, imposing the encomienda system in 1524. He reserved many encomiendas for himself and for his retinue, which they considered just rewards for their accomplishment in conquering central Mexico. However, later arrivals and members of factions antipathetic to Cort\u00e9s complained of the favoritism that excluded them.In 1523, the Crown (possibly influenced by Cort\u00e9s's enemy, Bishop Fonseca), sent a military force under the command of Francisco de Garay to conquer and settle the northern part of Mexico, the region of P\u00e1nuco. This was another setback for Cort\u00e9s who mentioned this in his fourth letter to the King in which he describes himself as the victim of a conspiracy by his archenemies Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, Diego Columbus and Bishop Fonseca as well as Francisco Garay. The influence of Garay was effectively stopped by this appeal to the King who sent out a decree forbidding Garay to interfere in the politics of New Spain, causing him to give up without a fight.\n\n\n== Royal grant of arms (1525) ==\n\nAlthough Cort\u00e9s had flouted the authority of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in sailing to the mainland and then leading an expedition of conquest, Cort\u00e9s's spectacular success was rewarded by the crown with a coat of arms, a mark of high honor, following the conqueror's request. The document granting the coat of arms summarizes Cort\u00e9s's accomplishments in the conquest of Mexico. The proclamation of the king says in part:\n\nWe, respecting the many labors, dangers, and adventures which you underwent as stated above, and so that there might remain a perpetual memorial of you and your services and that you and your descendants might be more fully honored ... it is our will that besides your coat of arms of your lineage, which you have, you may have and bear as your coat of arms, known and recognized, a shield ...\nThe grant specifies the iconography of the coat of arms, the central portion divided into quadrants. In the upper portion, there is a \"black eagle with two heads on a white field, which are the arms of the empire\". Below that is a \"golden lion on a red field, in memory of the fact that you, the said Hernando Cort\u00e9s, by your industry and effort brought matters to the state described above\" (i.e., the conquest). The specificity of the other two quadrants is linked directly to Mexico, with one quadrant showing three crowns representing the three Aztec emperors of the conquest era, Moctezuma, Cuitlahuac, and Cuauhtemoc and the other showing the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Encircling the central shield are symbols of the seven city-states around the lake and their lords that Cort\u00e9s defeated, with the lords \"to be shown as prisoners bound with a chain which shall be closed with a lock beneath the shield\".\n\n\n== Death of his first wife and remarriage ==\n \nCort\u00e9s's wife Catalina S\u00faarez arrived in New Spain around summer 1522, along with her sister and brother. His marriage to Catalina was at this point extremely awkward, since she was a kinswoman of the governor of Cuba, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, whose authority Cort\u00e9s had thrown off and who was therefore now his enemy. Catalina lacked the noble title of do\u00f1a, so at this point his marriage with her no longer raised his status. Their marriage had been childless. Since Cort\u00e9s had sired children with a variety of indigenous women, including a son around 1522 by his cultural translator, Do\u00f1a Marina, Cort\u00e9s knew he was capable of fathering children. Cort\u00e9s's only male heir at this point was illegitimate, but nonetheless named after Cort\u00e9s's father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s. This son Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s was sometimes called \"El Mestizo\".Catalina Su\u00e1rez died under mysterious circumstances the night of November 1\u20132, 1522. There were accusations at the time that Cort\u00e9s had murdered his wife. There was an investigation into her death, interviewing a variety of household residents and others. The documentation of the investigation was published in the nineteenth century in Mexico and these archival documents were uncovered in the twentieth century. The death of Catalina Su\u00e1rez produced a scandal and investigation, but Cort\u00e9s was now free to marry someone of high status more appropriate to his wealth and power. In 1526, he built an imposing residence for himself, the Palace of Cort\u00e9s in Cuernavaca, in a region close to the capital where he had extensive encomienda holdings. In 1529 he had been accorded the noble designation of don, but more importantly was given the noble title of Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Do\u00f1a Juana de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. The marriage produced three children, including another son, who was also named Mart\u00edn. As the first-born legitimate son, Don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was now Cort\u00e9s's heir and succeeded him as holder of the title and estate of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca. Cort\u00e9s's legitimate daughters were Do\u00f1a Maria, Do\u00f1a Catalina, and Do\u00f1a Juana.\n\n\n== Cort\u00e9s and the \"Spiritual Conquest\" of Mexico ==\nSince the conversion to Christianity of indigenous peoples was an essential and integral part of the extension of Spanish power, making formal provisions for that conversion once the military conquest was completed was an important task for Cort\u00e9s. During the Age of Discovery, the Catholic Church had seen early attempts at conversion in the Caribbean islands by Spanish friars, particularly the mendicant orders. Cort\u00e9s made a request to the Spanish monarch to send Franciscan and Dominican friars to Mexico to convert the vast indigenous populations to Christianity. In his fourth letter to the king, Cort\u00e9s pleaded for friars rather than diocesan or secular priests because those clerics were in his view a serious danger to the Indians' conversion.\n\nIf these people [Indians] were now to see the affairs of the Church and the service of God in the hands of canons or other dignitaries, and saw them indulge in the vices and profanities now common in Spain, knowing that such men were the ministers of God, it would bring our Faith into much harm that I believe any further preaching would be of no avail.\nHe wished the mendicants to be the main evangelists. Mendicant friars did not usually have full priestly powers to perform all the sacraments needed for conversion of the Indians and growth of the neophytes in the Christian faith, so Cort\u00e9s laid out a solution to this to the king.\n\nYour Majesty should likewise beseech His Holiness [the pope] to grant these powers to the two principal persons in the religious orders that are to come here, and that they should be his delegates, one from the Order of St. Francis and the other from the Order of St. Dominic. They should bring the most extensive powers Your Majesty is able to obtain, for, because these lands are so far from the Church of Rome, and we, the Christians who now reside here and shall do so in the future, are so far from the proper remedies of our consciences and, as we are human, so subject to sin, it is essential that His Holiness should be generous with us and grant to these persons most extensive powers, to be handed down to persons actually in residence here whether it be given to the general of each order or to his provincials.\nThe Franciscans arrived in May 1524, a symbolically powerful group of twelve known as the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, led by Fray Mart\u00edn de Valencia. Franciscan Geronimo de Mendieta claimed that Cort\u00e9s's most important deed was the way he met this first group of Franciscans. The conqueror himself was said to have met the friars as they approached the capital, kneeling at the feet of the friars who had walked from the coast. This story was told by Franciscans to demonstrate Cort\u00e9s piety and humility and was a powerful message to all, including the Indians, that Cort\u00e9s's earthly power was subordinate to the spiritual power of the friars. However, one of the first twelve Franciscans, Fray Toribio de Benavente Motolinia does not mention it in his history. Cort\u00e9s and the Franciscans had a particularly strong alliance in Mexico, with Franciscans seeing him as \"the new Moses\" for conquering Mexico and opening it to Christian evangelization. In Motolinia's 1555 response to Dominican Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, he praises Cort\u00e9s.\n\nAnd as to those who murmur against the Marqu\u00e9s del Valle [Cort\u00e9s], God rest him, and who try to blacken and obscure his deeds, I believe that before God their deeds are not as acceptable as those of the Marqu\u00e9s. Although as a human he was a sinner, he had faith and works of a good Christian, and a great desire to employ his life and property in widening and augmenting the fair of Jesus Christ, and dying for the conversion of these gentiles ... Who has loved and defended the Indians of this new world like Cort\u00e9s? ... Through this captain, God opened the door for us to preach his holy gospel and it was he who caused the Indians to revere the holy sacraments and respect the ministers of the church.\nIn Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan's 1585 revision of the conquest narrative first codified as Book XII of the Florentine Codex, there are laudatory references to Cort\u00e9s that do not appear in the earlier text from the indigenous perspective. Whereas Book XII of the Florentine Codex concludes with an account of Spaniards' search for gold, in Sahag\u00fan's 1585 revised account, he ends with praise of Cort\u00e9s for requesting the Franciscans be sent to Mexico to convert the Indians.\n\n\n== Expedition to Honduras and aftermath ==\n\nFrom 1524 to 1526, Cort\u00e9s headed an expedition to Honduras where he defeated Crist\u00f3bal de Olid, who had claimed Honduras as his own under the influence of the Governor of Cuba Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. Fearing that Cuauht\u00e9moc might head an insurrection in Mexico, he brought him with him to Honduras. In a controversial move, Cuauht\u00e9moc was executed during the journey. Raging over Olid's treason, Cort\u00e9s issued a decree to arrest Vel\u00e1zquez, whom he was sure was behind Olid's treason. This, however, only served to further estrange the Crown of Castile and the Council of Indies, both of which were already beginning to feel anxious about Cort\u00e9s's rising power.\n\nCort\u00e9s's fifth letter to King Charles attempts to justify his conduct, concludes with a bitter attack on \"various and powerful rivals and enemies\" who have \"obscured the eyes of your Majesty\". Charles, who was also Holy Roman Emperor, had little time for distant colonies (much of Charles's reign was taken up with wars with France, the German Protestants and the expanding Ottoman Empire), except insofar as they contributed to finance his wars. In 1521, year of the Conquest, Charles was attending to matters in his German domains and Bishop Adrian of Utrecht functioned as regent in Spain.\nVel\u00e1zquez and Fonseca persuaded the regent to appoint a commissioner (a Juez de residencia, Luis Ponce de Le\u00f3n) with powers to investigate Cort\u00e9s's conduct and even arrest him. Cort\u00e9s was once quoted as saying that it was \"more difficult to contend against [his] own countrymen than against the Aztecs.\" Governor Diego Vel\u00e1zquez continued to be a thorn in his side, teaming up with Bishop Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca, chief of the Spanish colonial department, to undermine him in the Council of the Indies.\nA few days after Cort\u00e9s's return from his expedition, Ponce de Le\u00f3n suspended Cort\u00e9s from his office of governor of New Spain. The Licentiate then fell ill and died shortly after his arrival, appointing Marcos de Aguilar as alcalde mayor. The aged Aguilar also became sick and appointed Alonso de Estrada governor, who was confirmed in his functions by a royal decree in August 1527. Cort\u00e9s, suspected of poisoning them, refrained from taking over the government.\nEstrada sent Diego de Figueroa to the south. De Figueroa raided graveyards and extorted contributions, meeting his end when the ship carrying these treasures sank. Albornoz persuaded Alonso de Estrada to release Gonzalo de Salazar and Chirinos. When Cort\u00e9s complained angrily after one of his adherents' hands was cut off, Estrada ordered him exiled. Cort\u00e9s sailed for Spain in 1528 to appeal to King Charles.\n\n\n=== First return to Spain (1528) and Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca ===\n\nIn 1528, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain to appeal to the justice of his master, Charles V. Juan Altamirano and Alonso Valiente stayed in Mexico and acted as Cort\u00e9s' representatives during his absence. Cort\u00e9s presented himself with great splendor before Charles V's court. By this time Charles had returned and Cort\u00e9s forthrightly responded to his enemy's charges. Denying he had held back on gold due the crown, he showed that he had contributed more than the quinto (one-fifth) required. Indeed, he had spent lavishly to build the new capital of Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, leveled during the siege that brought down the Aztec empire.\nHe was received by Charles with every distinction, and decorated with the order of Santiago. In return for his efforts in expanding the still young Spanish Empire, Cort\u00e9s was rewarded in 1529 by being accorded the noble title of don but more importantly named the \"Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca\" (Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Do\u00f1a Juana Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, after the 1522 death of his much less distinguished first wife, Catalina Su\u00e1rez. The noble title and senorial estate of the Marquesado was passed down to his descendants until 1811. The Oaxaca Valley was one of the wealthiest regions of New Spain, and Cort\u00e9s had 23,000 vassals in 23 named encomiendas in perpetuity.Although confirmed in his land holdings and vassals, he was not reinstated as governor and was never again given any important office in the administration of New Spain. During his travel to Spain, his property was mismanaged by abusive colonial administrators. He sided with local natives in a lawsuit. The natives documented the abuses in the Huexotzinco Codex.\nThe entailed estate and title passed to his legitimate son Don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s upon Cort\u00e9s's death in 1547, who became the Second Marquess. Don Mart\u00edn's association with the so-called Encomenderos' Conspiracy endangered the entailed holdings, but they were restored and remained the continuing reward for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's family through the generations.\n\n\n=== Return to Mexico ===\n\nCort\u00e9s returned to Mexico in 1530 with new titles and honors, but with diminished power. Although Cort\u00e9s still retained military authority and permission to continue his conquests, viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza was appointed in 1535 to administer New Spain's civil affairs. This division of power led to continual dissension, and caused the failure of several enterprises in which Cort\u00e9s was engaged. On returning to Mexico, Cort\u00e9s found the country in a state of anarchy. There was a strong suspicion in court circles of an intended rebellion by Cort\u00e9s.\nAfter reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order, Cort\u00e9s retired to his estates at Cuernavaca, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Mexico City. There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration. Remaining in Mexico between 1530 and 1541, Cort\u00e9s quarreled with Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n and disputed the right to explore the territory that is today California with Antonio de Mendoza, the first viceroy.\nCort\u00e9s acquired several silver mines in Zumpango del Rio in 1534. By the early 1540s, he owned 20 silver mines in Sultepec, 12 in Taxco, and 3 in Zacualpan. Earlier, Cort\u00e9s had claimed the silver in the Tamazula area.In 1536, Cort\u00e9s explored the northwestern part of Mexico and discovered the Baja California Peninsula. Cort\u00e9s also spent time exploring the Pacific coast of Mexico. The Gulf of California was originally named the Sea of Cort\u00e9s by its discoverer Francisco de Ulloa in 1539. This was the last major expedition by Cort\u00e9s.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\n\n=== Second return to Spain ===\nAfter his exploration of Baja California, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain in 1541, hoping to confound his angry civilians, who had brought many lawsuits against him (for debts, abuse of power, etc.).On his return he went through a crowd to speak to the emperor, who demanded of him who he was. \"I am a man,\" replied Cort\u00e9s, \"who has given you more provinces than your ancestors left you cities.\"\n\n\n=== Expedition against Algiers ===\n\nThe emperor finally permitted Cort\u00e9s to join him and his fleet commanded by Andrea Doria at the great expedition against Algiers in the Barbary Coast in 1541, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire and was used as a base by Hayreddin Barbarossa, a famous Turkish corsair and Admiral-in-Chief of the Ottoman Fleet. During this campaign, Cort\u00e9s was almost drowned in a storm that hit his fleet while he was pursuing Barbarossa.\n\n\n=== Last years, death, and remains ===\nHaving spent a great deal of his own money to finance expeditions, he was now heavily in debt. In February 1544 he made a claim on the royal treasury, but was ignored for the next three years. Disgusted, he decided to return to Mexico in 1547. When he reached Seville, he was stricken with dysentery. He died in Castilleja de la Cuesta, Seville province, on December 2, 1547, from a case of pleurisy at the age of 62.\nHe left his many mestizo and white children well cared for in his will, along with every one of their mothers. He requested in his will that his remains eventually be buried in Mexico. Before he died he had the Pope remove the \"natural\" status of four of his children (legitimizing them in the eyes of the church), including Martin, the son he had with Do\u00f1a Marina (also known as La Malinche), said to be his favourite. His daughter, Do\u00f1a Catalina, however, died shortly after her father's death.\n\nAfter his death, his body was moved more than eight times for several reasons. On December 4, 1547 he was buried in the mausoleum of the Duke of Medina in the church of San Isidoro del Campo, Sevilla. Three years later (1550) due to the space being required by the duke, his body was moved to the altar of Santa Catarina in the same church. In his testament, Cort\u00e9s asked for his body to be buried in the monastery he had ordered to be built in Coyoacan in M\u00e9xico, ten years after his death, but the monastery was never built. So in 1566, his body was sent to New Spain and buried in the church of San Francisco de Texcoco, where his mother and one of his sisters were buried.\n\nIn 1629, Don Pedro Cort\u00e9s fourth \"Marquez del Valle, his last male descendant, died, so the viceroy decided to move the bones of Cort\u00e9s along with those of his descendant to the Franciscan church in M\u00e9xico. This was delayed for nine years, while his body stayed in the main room of the palace of the viceroy. Eventually it was moved to the Sagrario of Franciscan church, where it stayed for 87 years. In 1716, it was moved to another place in the same church. In 1794, his bones were moved to the \"Hospital de Jesus\" (founded by Cort\u00e9s), where a statue by Tols\u00e1 and a mausoleum were made. There was a public ceremony and all the churches in the city rang their bells.In 1823, after the independence of M\u00e9xico, it seemed imminent that his body would be desecrated, so the mausoleum was removed, the statue and the coat of arms were sent to Palermo, Sicily, to be protected by the Duke of Terranova. The bones were hidden, and everyone thought that they had been sent out of M\u00e9xico. In 1836, his bones were moved to another place in the same building.It was not until November 24, 1946 that they were rediscovered, thanks to the discovery of a secret document by Lucas Alam\u00e1n. His bones were put in the charge of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia (INAH). The remains were authenticated by INAH. They were then restored to the same place, this time with a bronze inscription and his coat of arms. When the bones were first rediscovered, the supporters of the Hispanic tradition in Mexico were excited, but one supporter of an indigenist vision of Mexico \"proposed that the remains be publicly burned in front of the statue of Cuauhtemoc, and the ashes flung into the air\". Following the discovery and authentication of Cort\u00e9s's remains, there was a discovery of what were described as the bones of Cuauht\u00e9moc, resulting in a \"battle of the bones\".\n\n\n== Taxa named after Cort\u00e9s ==\nCort\u00e9s is commemorated in the scientific name of a subspecies of Mexican lizard, Phrynosoma orbiculare cortezii.\n\n\n== Disputed interpretation of his life ==\nThere are relatively few sources to the early life of Cort\u00e9s; his fame arose from his participation in the conquest of Mexico and it was only after this that people became interested in reading and writing about him.\nProbably the best source is his letters to the king which he wrote during the campaign in Mexico, but they are written with the specific purpose of putting his efforts in a favourable light and so must be read critically. Another main source is the biography written by Cort\u00e9s's private chaplain Lopez de G\u00f3mara, which was written in Spain several years after the conquest. G\u00f3mara never set foot in the Americas and knew only what Cort\u00e9s had told him, and he had an affinity for knightly romantic stories which he incorporated richly in the biography. The third major source is written as a reaction to what its author calls \"the lies of Gomara\", the eyewitness account written by the Conquistador Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo does not paint Cort\u00e9s as a romantic hero but rather tries to emphasize that Cort\u00e9s's men should also be remembered as important participants in the undertakings in Mexico.\n\nIn the years following the conquest more critical accounts of the Spanish arrival in Mexico were written. The Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas wrote his A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies which raises strong accusations of brutality and heinous violence towards the Indians; accusations against both the conquistadors in general and Cort\u00e9s in particular. The accounts of the conquest given in the Florentine Codex by the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and his native informants are also less than flattering towards Cort\u00e9s. The scarcity of these sources has led to a sharp division in the description of Cort\u00e9s's personality and a tendency to describe him as either a vicious and ruthless person or a noble and honorable cavalier.\n\n\n=== Representations in Mexico ===\n\nIn M\u00e9xico there are few representations of Cort\u00e9s. However, many landmarks still bear his name, from the castle Palacio de Cort\u00e9s in the city of Cuernavaca to some street names throughout the republic.\nThe pass between the volcanoes Iztacc\u00edhuatl and Popocat\u00e9petl where Cort\u00e9s took his soldiers on their march to Mexico City. It is known as the Paso de Cort\u00e9s.\nThe muralist Diego Rivera painted several representation of him but the most famous, depicts him as a powerful and ominous figure along with Malinche in a mural in the National Palace in Mexico City.\n\nIn 1981, President Lopez Portillo tried to bring Cort\u00e9s to public recognition. First, he made public a copy of the bust of Cort\u00e9s made by Manuel Tols\u00e1 in the Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno with an official ceremony, but soon a nationalist group tried to destroy it, so it had to be taken out of the public. Today the copy of the bust is in the \"Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno\"  while the original is in Naples, Italy, in the Villa Pignatelli.\nLater, another monument, known as \"Monumento al Mestizaje\" by Juli\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez y M. Maldonado (1982) was commissioned by Mexican president Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo to be put in the \"Z\u00f3calo\" (Main square) of Coyoacan, near the place of his country house, but it had to be removed to a little known park, the Jard\u00edn Xicot\u00e9ncatl, Barrio de San Diego Churubusco, to quell protests. The statue depicts Cort\u00e9s, Malinche and their son Mart\u00edn.There is another statue by Sebasti\u00e1n Aparicio, in Cuernavaca, was in a hotel \"El casino de la selva\". Cort\u00e9s is barely recognizable, so it sparked little interest. The hotel was closed to make a commercial center, and the statue was put out of public display by Costco the builder of the commercial center.\n\n\n=== Cultural depictions ===\n\nHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s is a character in the opera La Conquista (2005) by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero, which depicts the major episodes of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521.\n\n\n=== Writings: the Cartas de Relaci\u00f3n ===\nCort\u00e9s' personal account of the conquest of Mexico is narrated in his five letters addressed to Charles V. These five letters, the cartas de relaci\u00f3n, are Cort\u00e9s' only surviving writings. See \"Letters and Dispatches of Cort\u00e9s\", translated by George Folsom (New York, 1843); Prescott's \"Conquest of Mexico\" (Boston, 1843); and Sir Arthur Helps's \"Life of Hernando Cortes\" (London, 1871).His first letter was considered lost, and the one from the municipality of Veracruz has to take its place. It was published for the first time in volume IV of \"Documentos para la Historia de Espa\u00f1a\", and subsequently reprinted. \nThe Segunda Carta de Relacion, bearing the date of October 30, 1520, appeared in print at Seville in 1522. The third letter, dated May 15, 1522, appeared at Seville in 1523. The fourth, October 20, 1524, was printed at Toledo in 1525. The fifth, on the Honduras expedition, is contained in volume IV of the Documentos para la Historia de Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n== Children ==\nNatural children of Don Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\n\ndo\u00f1a Catalina Pizarro, born between 1514 and 1515 in Santiago de Cuba or maybe later in Nueva Espa\u00f1a, daughter of a Cuban woman, Leonor Pizarro.

        "wiki": "Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8santo \u00f0o\u02c8mi\u014b\u0261o] meaning \"Saint Dominic\"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (\"D.N.\", \"National District\"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 t\u027eu\u02c8xi\u029do]), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal.  In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos.  Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws.The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. In 1586, Francis Drake of England captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached England in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people.\" Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English were repulsed by mulatto and mestizo militiamen. Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo trolled the Caribbean Sea, attacking slave ships. This activity proved very beneficial to the Dominican privateers, as evidenced by the fact that Captain Lorenzo Daniel, aka Lorencin, captured more than 70 ships from Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1762\u20131763.\nThe French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in Saint-Domingue, and they were exploited until the French Revolution of 1789. Former plantation slave Toussaint L'ouverture led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons. They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The Haitian rebels fought not only against the Dominicans, but also the French, rival rebel groups, and the British.\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was conquered by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.On 27 February 1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.The mulatto landowner Buenaventura B\u00e1ez emerged as one of the leaders of the Dominican War of Independence, and he failed (in 1846) to convince France to establish a protectorate in the Dominican Republic. B\u00e1ez went on to serve as President from 1849 to 1853 and from 1856 to 1858, and he launched a naval offensive against Haiti. The Dominican Navy attacked Haitian ports and ships in southern Haiti, effectively destroying the Haitian Navy. In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island. The war left more than 50,000 people dead,  including 40,888 Spanish. Despite regaining its freedom, the capital would continue to experience difficulties, beginning when Pedro Antonio Pimentel, the head of the provisional government at Santiago de los Caballeros, attempted to march triumphantly upon Santo Domingo in August 1865 only to be checked by rival southern forces under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral.\n\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on October 24\u201325, 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans. Eventually the Americans withdrew in 1924.The city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of mulatto dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Trujillo imposed a cult of personality and on 2\u20138 October 1937 he ordered a massacre against Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the \"Parsley Massacre\", killing 67,000 people. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war led by Francisco Caama\u00f1o who led the Constitucionalistas fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting against the Constitucionalistas on June 15 and June 16. Newsweek described it this way:\n\nAmid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965 with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead. Caama\u00f1o was exiled to London.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse \u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n \u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Ozama river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures of 17 to 19 \u00b0C (63 to 66 \u00b0F)). July through September are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on 29 May 2002.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family - beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\n\nCiudad (city) \u2013 applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.\nEnsanche (lit. \"widening\") \u2013 usually, but not always, applied to the more \"modern\" parts of the city.\nVilla (village) \u2013 the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population is composed of immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as U.S.-born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions. The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado.\nThe \"Polic\u00eda Nacional\" (National Police) and \"Policia Tur\u00edstica\" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.\n\nThe infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.\nSanto Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.\nBella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Commercial centers ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe performing arts are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.\n\nSanto Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located in the Zona Colonial district. In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of Alc\u00e1zar, in Diego Colon's palace, the Museum of the Casas Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient weapons donated by Trujillo, the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican independence, and the World of Ambar Museum.\n\nPlaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the Centro Ol\u00edmpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan American Games.\nIn the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian Ta\u00edno art.\n\n\n== Parks and recreational areas ==\nThe city has various parks, many of which are relatively large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Col\u00f3n Park are located in Zona Colonial.\n\nOther notable parks include:\n\nParque Enriquillo\nParque Independencia\nParque Metropolitano Las Praderas\nEl Malec\u00f3n\nJard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional\nParque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional\nBarrio Chino de Santo Domingo\nParque N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres\nParque Iberoam\u00e9rica\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas and is also the only public university in the city. Santo Domingo holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education degree.\n\nOther universities include:\n\nUniversidad Adventista Dominicana (UNAD)\nUniversidad APEC (UNAPEC)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC)\nUniversidad del Caribe (UNICARIBE)\nUniversidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) (UNIBE)\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Santo Domingo (UCSD)\nUniversidad de la Tercera Edad (UTE)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago (UTESA)\nUniversidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a (UNPHU)\nInstituto de Ciencias Exactas (INCE)\nUniversidad Organizaci\u00f3n y M\u00e9todo (O&M)\nUniversidad Interamericana (UNICA)\nUniversidad Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos (UNIREMOS)\nUniversidad Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC)\nUniversidad Instituto Cultural Dom\u00ednico Americano (UNICDA)\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM)\nUniversidad de Psicologia Industrial Dominicana (UPID)\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nSanto Domingo has an underground and elevated rapid transit metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.In 2018 a 5 kilometer Santo Domingo cable car (teleferico) was opened to the public with the purpose to provide service to the poorest areas to the east and north of the metropolitan area and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports.

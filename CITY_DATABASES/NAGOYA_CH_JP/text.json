        "wiki": "Nagoya (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02, Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region of Japan. It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1 million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of 6,923 persons per km2. Also as of December 2010 an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there\u2014a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of World War II in 1945.The area is 326.45 square kilometres (126.04 sq mi).  Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10 million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNagoya is the center of Greater Nagoya, which earned nearly 70 percent of Japan's 2003 trade surplus.\n\n\n=== Automotive industry ===\nNagoya's main industry is automotive. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus, Denso, Aisin Seiki Co., Toyota Industries, JTEKT and Toyota Boshoku have their headquarters in or near Nagoya. Mitsubishi Motors has an R&D division in the suburb of Okazaki. Major component suppliers such as Magna International and PPG also have a strong presence here. Spark plug maker NGK and Nippon Sharyo, known for manufacturing rolling stock including the Shinkansen are headquartered there.\n\n\n=== Aviation industry ===\nThe aviation history has historically been of importance since the industrialization. During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area. Robot technology is another rapidly developing industry.\nA materials engineering industry is developing.Brother Industries, which is known for office electronics such as multifunction printers is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, which is known for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment. Many small machine tool and electronics companies are also based in the area.The World Expo 2005, also known as Aichi Expo was held near Nagoya in the neighboring cities of Nagakute and Seto from March 25 to September 25, 2005.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nRetail is of importance in the city. Traditional department stores with roots in Nagoya are Matsuzakaya, Maruei and the Meitetsu Department Store. Oriental Nakamura was bought by Mitsukoshi from Tokyo in 1977.\n\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nThe Owari province was historically well known for the cloisonn\u00e9 art form. The Ando Cloisonn\u00e9 Company continues the long tradition.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Confectionery company Marukawa is well known.\nThe city offers venues for conferences and congresses such as the Nagoya Congress Center and the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nNagoya is served by Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO), built on an artificial island in Tokoname. The airport has international flights and a high volume of domestic flights.\nA second airport is Nagoya Airfield (Komaki Airport, NKM) near the city's boundary with Komaki and Kasugai. On February 17, 2005, Nagoya Airport's commercial international flights moved to Centrair Airport. Nagoya Airfield is now used for general aviation and as an airbase and is the main Fuji Dream Airlines hub.\nNagoya Station, the world's largest train station by floor area, is on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, and the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, among others. JR Central, which operates the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, has its headquarters there. Meitetsu is also based in Nagoya, and along with Kintetsu provides regional rail service to the T\u014dkai and Kansai regions. Nagoya Subway provides urban transit service.\nNagoya Port is the largest port by international trade value in Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation exports via this port.\nNagoya is known for its orderly grid street plan for which the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu is ultimately responsible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNagoya has mostly state-run primary and secondary schools. The area in the city limits includes international schools such as the Nagoya International School and Col\u00e9gio Brasil Jap\u00e3o Prof. Shinoda Brazilian school.State and private colleges and universities primarily located in the eastern area. Some Western-style institutions were founded early in the Meiji era, with more opening during the Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa eras. Nagoya University was set up in 1871 as a medical school and has produced six Nobel Prize laureates in science. Nanzan University was established by the Roman Catholic Society of the Divine Word in 1932 as a high school and expanded to include Nanzan Junior College and the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. The main campus was designed in the 1960s by the renowned architect Antonin Raymond. Some universities specialise in engineering and technology, such as Nagoya University Engineering school, Nagoya Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute; these universities receive support and grants from companies such as Toyota.\nOther colleges and universities include: Aichi Prefectural College of Nursing & Health, Aichi Shukutoku Junior College, Aichi Toho University, Chukyo University, Daido University, Doho University, Kinjo Gakuin University, Kinjo Gakuin University Junior College, Meijo University, Nagoya City University, Nagoya College of Music, Nagoya Future Culture College, Nagoya Gakuin University, Nagoya Management Junior College, Nagoya Women's University, St. Mary's College, Nagoya, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Sugiyama Jogakuen University Junior College, Tokai Gakuen Women's College.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city.

Wards and areas host local festivals such as the Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri (\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d, Street Performer's Festival) in \u014csu.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe Nagoya dialect (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01, Nagoya-ben) is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi). Dishes include: \n\nTebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori\nTenmusu: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp\nKishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.\nRed miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce and miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup)\nHitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as unadon, with spice and as chazuke.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe world premier of the first Godzilla movie was in Nagoya on October 27, 1954. The city, especially Nagoya Castle, has been featured in three other Godzilla movies: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, and Godzilla vs. Mothra.

          "Though there are no trains to the castle area it is just a 20 minute walk from Dow town. The castle is quite picturesque and the grounds around it are pleasant enough though not up to Himeji or Osaka Castle. They offer samari and ninja presentations on weekends and holidays -",

          "Even though, the castle was closed for renovation but the newly built Hommaru Palace is a must-see! It is located next to the Nagoya castle (where it always had been before destroyed in the WWII). The palace was rebuilt with the same techniques and materials used in the original",

          "I was skeptical about this castle as I just saw the Matsumoto Castle a few days ago. This is quite different. The area is huge. Not to be missed is the palace tour. I like how IT is incorporated at some points. You need to take out your shoes, so make sure your socks don\u2019t",
          "We arrived Nagoya Castle at around noon on a Sunday afternoon. The crowd was good. Huge area. The main tower was not accessible though hence quite a disappointment. As we did not take our lunch, we found a small restaurant in the area and the food was good. They serve the local",

          "The area was big and could spend more than half day there easily. The entry fee is \u00a5500 per person but worth it. A lot of historical stuff to see. The day we visited the castle was not that busy, so could take some decent pictures. Can go there by subway.",
          "I visited Nagoya Castle using the free Nagoya guide service. (Pre-booking required) My English speaking guide, Miho Nabata, was very helpful ,well informed and gave a history of the castle. Note: Offer to pay transportation costs (bus, subway, metro) and treat your guide to",
          "A perfect start to Nagoya. The castle grounds are beautiful. There are so many Sakura trees around it and it just looks even more wonderful when they are blooming. The castle itself was closed for maintenance work but we were able to visit another exhibition that was ongoing",
          "The castle was built in Edo period and was one of the largest castles in the country. The castle palace was recently rebuilt and was partly re-opened for visits. There were many artifacts displayed worth a view. The Gyoikou being a special species of sakura with green petals",
          "This castle is undergoing construction so you can not go inside. We found this out after we paid for our tickets. Be sure to ask before paying if it\u2019s open. The outside is gorgeous but just disappointed in the visit.",

          "Like many castles, this one was totally destroyed in WW2. The Japanese did however rebuild and continue to build the castle with original plans from the ancient. It is beautiful and great for pictures.",
          "We went to this scenic place in the midst of summer that\u2019s probably way too hot if you\u2019re opting to walk around the area. But for spring or winter this might be a better plan. The park was big and the area has refreshments. We didn\u2019t go inside the castle for some reasons but we",
          "Great Castle and impressive grounds. Only had a couple of hourse, so didnt into any of the inside displays, but enjoyed the stroll around the outside",
          "Great place to walk around in Nagoya during sakura season, but we were not able to go inside the castle. Lots of street food to try as you walk in the park near the castle area. There is no subway nearby the Nagoya castle so we had to walk a long way just to get to the site,",
          "Nice walk at Nagoya Castle... must go especially during the Sakura season.. you may choose Me-guru tour bus to reach here.",
          "The castle is located at the center of city and may be reached very easily. Great place with interesting history. A classic Japan theater is nearby and free to visit.",

          "Disappointed that the castle was closed for construction. Much of the garden area was blocked off as well. We did see a samurai show that was entertaining. Wait until next year to visit.",
          "Our ship arrived in Yokkaichi on a wet and cold day. The port is about half an hour away from the castle and we passed through large industrial sites. The castle can only be seen from the outside. It is a flat wall from the coach parking site It has 4 keeps it is pretty in",

          "I have found Nagoya a much slower pace (which is a good thing) and less crowded compared to Tokyo and Osaka. We spent a nice day leisurely stroll along the castle area, visited the replication of the inside castle with detail of all the rooms. Very nicely done. There's a garden",
          "The castle keep is closed but there are other things to see, particularly during Sakura season. The castle park is pretty sizable, and the cherry blossom trees are scattered in a number of spots. Beside the crowded and much photographed area in from of the castle, there is a",
          "Was abit disappointed as i am expecting to go inside the castle. However we are just able to see from outside and another replica building. I went to himeiji castle last year and was expecting the same. However the garden is nice especially with sakura outside",
          "We spent a nice hour on a sunny Sunday afternoon strolling here but there isn\u2019t much you can access, or which is not impacted by construction work. And its all rebuilt after WWII. So nothing original except impressive moat walls",
          "Castle visit is our top pick whenever travelling to any cities in Japan. This time we came to visit Nagoya castle, I would say it is really huge and graceful, everything in there is well organized with superb serenity. You will never regret spending 2-3 hours here, it just makes",

          "It's a must visit anyway if you're in Nagoya City. 10% Discount if you're using Meguru bus pass. There's a nearby eating places outside the castle",
          "It is actually an icon for Nagoya, it is kind of a must visit place. If you brought a day ticket for train, it is recommended to make a visit. Nothing much to do, just take a photo of its exterior as you can't get in to the castle as it was colse for renovations.",
          "It\u2019s been awhile since the residential area has been restored and it\u2019s my first time to see. Great efforts were made to restore the once it was declared national treasury before burnt down by fire. Although there is a need to queue up, it\u2019s worth while waiting to see how the",
          "The main castle is under reconstruction so it\u2019s closed for visiting. For 500 yen you enter the castle area and you can visit some smaller towers and the hommaru palace.

          "The ambience felt very peaceful in the area of the castle. The tower was still under construction, but I had a wonderful time walking the grounds. The palace was very interesting as well, even though everything was recreated. Sort of reminds me of the hall of mirrors, but less",

          "Truely magnificent! Very beautiful castle and always amazing the attention to detail, however some of the building is under construction.",

          "Nice place to relax and take photos! Suitable for family group!",
          "A remarkable slice of Japanese history but the castle is being renovated so you can\u2019t currently go inside it. For this reason I think the entry price should be discounted. For a construction site, it\u2019s still very tidy and organised (which is typically Japanese in itself).",

          "Actually this castle isn't too amazing if you keep in mind that it's not the original one anymore. It was rebuild after it burned down.\nBut since there is nothing else to do in Nagoya this still is one of the most spectacular things to see.",

It houses a great display of weapons, armour and period buildings and living.",

          "This aquarium was a lot better than the kyoto one as it is larger and has both orcas and beluga whales. The orca training is in the side pools of the stadium. We recommend taking the seats on the higer level so you could actually see the real live show rather than rely on the",
          "The Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium is one of the best i ever visited! The killer whale is one of the rare ones you will ever get to see. plus the dolphins n belugas, it makes the experience really good. And the close encounter n the closeness of the trainers with the whales,",
          "We went with 2 teenagers and 11 yr-old. Very impressed with tanks of belugas, orca, sardines which we have not seen over in Singapore SEA aquarium. Their dolphins performance is in Japanese only and nothing to rave about having seen better shows in Gold Coast. Fun filled 4 hours",
          "The entrance fees doesn't really burn ur pockets as it is public aquarium. Kids enjoyed the hands on experience wh the jelly fish. As the photos seen here,me dancing wh the dolphins \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01. Oh! Do explore the area around Nagoya Port.",
          "We went on a cloudy day and it was interesting to see the animals play in the shows etc. It was my first time seeing belugas and killer whales up close so it was a novelty. Nice aquarium, but definitely can improve on quality of shows. Also a little old - can use a renovation!",
          "This is a very fantastic aquarium. There many fishes and water animals. White Dolphin Beluga, Killer Whales, Turtles and many beautiful jellyfishes. You can go for walking, couples, families and friends.The aquarium was just like an amusement park. You can enjoy with anybody.",
          "The highlight of the aquarium is the shows, both indoor and outdoor. The Sardine Tornado is quite a unique, it dances with light and sound. The second best is the Beluga Show which I've never seen in any other aquarium before. For the Orca and Dolphin show is similar to",
          "The place is hyped. Huge place but they seem to exhibit or at least focus their exhibits on three animals. The killer whale, the belluga whale and the bottle nose dolphins. The shows are great. However, it seems saddening to see these beautiful animals kept in captivity.",
          "Must see the dolphin and Orca shows, make sure you go there 30min beforehand . We went on a Monday but packed (?summer holiday). The exhibits are a little average by comparison with other aquariums we visited in Japan and East Asia.",
          "It was a serious discrimination against the tourist. There was a child-parent visit adventure task to complete and at the end you will receive free souvenirs with a color pen or some animal folding paper. We were told that we were tourists and no souvenirs would be given at the",
          "They have a huge, huge dolphin pool and a huge pane of glass that gives us a great view of entire pool under water. Did not know the dolphins swims so fast and freely under the water. You will never be able to see something like this in any other aquarium in Japan.",
          "Our kids really love to visit aquariums. They have visited the ones in Osaka, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Jakarta but they had the most enjoyment and fun at the Nagoya aquarium, as did we. The dolphin show was really great as was the Orca show. The aquarium designed",
          "We visited in April and had an awesome time watching the Orcas and Belugas trainings and Dolphine show. Visitors who wants to view the Orca training should stand near the Orca tanks on the viewing deck. Visitors should also keep track of the time so as to watch all the shows. We",
          "The dolphin show is amazing. You kids will enjoy a lot. The aquarium is relatively small but it's worth to visit.",
          "One of the best aquarium I have ever seen. We went in Tuesday so it wasn\u2019t crowded. Well designed. Stroller friendly. Adult fee 2000\u00a5 and 500\u00a5 for a child ticket. It has dolphins performance show and Orca training which are not usual in aquarium. You easily spend 2-3 hrs may be",
          "Visited the aquarium in Dec 18. The outdoor show was awesome! Only penguin enclosure was disappointing.",
          "We arrived about 11am and already there were many people waiting in line to get in. As usual in Japan public places of interest are always overcrowded and people are lining up like sheep. Once inside you come to the viewing tanks of the dolphins which was nice. One thing I",
          "This was our second visit to the aquarium and still amazing! We enjoyed watching the dolphin show and the killer whale and beluga whale training. Lots of performances and demonstrations at different times to keep everyone\u2019s attention. The facility is very clean and",
          "This is the 1st place we went after dropping our luggage at the hotel. We took the efficient Nagoya subway from Hisaya Odori Station on the Meijo Line and arrived at the last station, Nagoya-ko. The Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium is a short walk from the station. Once you",
          "This has got to be the best thing we\u2019ve done in Nagoya. Both our 11 & 13 year old (us included) enjoyed ourselves here. There were many shows (and repeated shows in case you missed them). The Tornado of Sardines show has got to be the highlight of our trip here. They were",
          "The dolphin show was one of its kind. It was great. Saw that performance twice. Also saw \u201cpenguin walk \u201cbut the penguins were in bad condition. Sea creatures collection was great.",
          "The aquarium has 3 floors with north and south side. Spaceful and many attractions to see, but the walk path is quite confusing and may easily get lost. There's always show on the schedules, take the showtime table at the entrance. Great place for up to half-day to visit! But",
          "I enjoyed a lot specially dolphin show and penguin walk. but collection of sea life is not rich for travelers.",
          "Visited during the Japan Summer, and the crowds were big. With typical Japanese efficiency, we were able to get our tickets quickly and into the aquarium, going through the amazing arrays and varieties of marine creatures, large and small. The building is designed to move the",
          "Quite a bit of diversity for an aquarium including large and small mammals. Dolphin, Orca & Beluga whale Attraction were unforgettable attraction, especially for children. Recommended place to be visited when you are in Nagoya.",
          "As aquariums go this is good with excellent exhibitions from the various oceans including deep sea. Very impressive but let down for us by the two captive orcas who appwar to be kept in too small facilities. Im sure the trainers mean well but whales in captivity should not be",
          "The port of Nagoya is a small place but has a great collection of fishes. I was amazed by the skeleton of the whale.",
          "We have been to aquarium several times and my son loves it. Dolphins,killer whales , balugas and so many different fish species are there. Their shows are nice. Specially the beluga whales'. However the shows of dolphin and killer whales are not much nice as the ones in kamogawa",
          "The sea animals are in good condition. This aquarium has fish or specimen that hard to find elsewhere, such as fish with wings, and very deep water fish.",
          "We walked over to the port area in the early morning (planing later to eat at the Red Lobster for an early lunch) when we stumbled across this very nice aquarium... a mini Sea World. Very clean with an interesting layout. The whales and penguins were the highlights of course.",
          "The highlight of this aquarium definitely has to be the orcas and belugas. The size and magnitude of these creatures were breath-taking. The aquarium also has dolphins, penguins, jellyfishes. The orca training was done in the 2 smaller pools behind the large main pool and",
          "Different highlights compared to osaka kaiyukan aquarium. This one has great dolphins show, Belunga feeding and orca training show. Pluses: dolphins show, less crowded, great outdoor view (ocean), penguins. Minuses: not so many type of fish, less English sign/explanatory.",
          "Disappointed actually, not enough space for the whales and very little information was in English so unless you are fluent in Japanese I personally wouldn\u2019t go, although the dolphins are very intelligent and worth seeing!",
          "I enjoy zoos and aquariums when they're done right, but unfortunately this aquarium leaves a lot to be desired. - The killer whales and belugas don't have enough space at all. It was heartbreaking to see. - Some of their dolphins originate from Taiji and are captured on",
          "The public aquarium is a fun day out for kids but nothing out of the ordinary. The main attractions are the enormous killer whales and the dolphins which do regular shows throughout the day. The shows are fun but the tanks are small and you do worry about the welfare of the",
          "Lots for both adults and kids to see and learn. They have beluga whales, orcas, dolphins and some interesting species that I've not seen elsewhere. The Aquarium is probably quite old but extremely well maintained. They have touch pools and dolphin shows as well.",
          "Having been to Osaka's Kaiyukan Aquarium, I was expecting more of the same here. However, this aquarium is more akin to SeaWorld than Kaiyukan. Upon stepping inside, you will see the dolphins and orcas almost immediately. I have some reservations about animals kept in captivity",
          "I went there with my girlfriend last week and really we enjoyed the time there with wonderful performances",
          "There is so much to see, so make sure to come early! The penguin area was my favorite. Unfortunately I missed most of the shows for the animals, so make sure to keep track of time and locations for shows if they are a priority.",
          "upon entering the aquarium, you are greeted with the orca and dolphins! They are in a huge tank that filled up the place and the size is impressive for Japan. The show was very good and the range of fish they had was great too.",
          "Its a great place for family outing, regardless of age, the aquarium is nice place. The killer whales and dolphins are interesting to watch and you can spend half a day at the attraction.",
          "The Nagoya acquarium is one of the better ones in Asia. It is suitably located on the seafront and there is a subway station right at its doorstep. We spent 2-3 hours here, visiting on weekday (Friday) when it wasn't too busy. The highlights are the Beluga, dolphin and Orca",
          "We spent a few hours here one day while in Nagoya in November 2017. While they have some good attractions that are nice to see (such as the Orcas and Beluga Whales) I did not find the aquarium to be something you absolutely have to do while in Nagoya. If aquariums are your thing",
          "The price is quite cheap compared to what you get. Only 2,000 JPY for entry fee. Very easy to travel to by metro (Nagoyago station). There were 3 orcas, 5-6 belugas, and a lot of dolphin. Must visit if you are around nagoya.",
          "A nice place to spend a day wandering among the exhibits & catching their Orca, Dolphin shows. Daily subway pass holders get a discount on entrance tickets.",
          "The show that catch our attention is the orcas show. It is quite cool! My 5years old daughter is so happy seeing all those orcas for the first time. They also have some big white bellugas. Quite awesome and cute!",
          "We came here our first weekend of our trip whilst visiting family... and do had our 3 grandchildren with us... wonderful place with plenty to see and do.. the Beluga whales a particular favourite and dolphin show is amazing... also good fries!!",
          "our daughter loved it and was fascniated by the Orcas and Dolphins. highly recpmmended for families with kids",
          "It is a good place to visit with children. Good staff and maintenance. Different types of living beings from the sea. Food services are not good. The penguins walk could be skipped. They not seem to be happy. Indoor and outdoor attractions.",
          "i can say it one one of the best aquarium in japan you must see the dolphin show where in the trainer ride the dolphin that you cannot see in other aquarium in japan",
          "The dolphin show was fantastic - book the ticket when you pay and keep tabs of the time.There's a wide array of fish to explore. very cool.",
          "Personally. I really enjoyed it. I paid 2400 yen instead of 2000yen cause I do believe the 2400 yen covers the 3 shows (dolphin, orca, and beluga). However, I think for the Japanese people, it's more about the honour system. Regardless, it was pretty straight forward getting",
          "Nice aquarium and not as large as the one in Okinawa but still fun to go. Perfect for half a day. There is a Red Lobster next to it and we love the food there.",
          "Loved the dolphin and sardine shows. Loved the displays, they were all at the right height for my little 3 years old kiddo. He could see everything juts like everyone else. Bring your own lunch it will be cheaper and better.",
          "It was an amazing experience being at this aquarium. Even though I visited the place alone, it was wonderful whole day full of memories. Family and friends visiting togetherr definitely could enjoy a lot....lot...a lot..dolphin performance was best segment. Must visit place in",
          "Large Kuroshio tank- wow fun / Deep sea gallery - exciting / sea turtle - Q lovely/ Killer whale / lovely dolphin / beluga,.... all and all these aquarium, I guess Japan doing good with fun, not only kids also for our adult. if you love ocean, son't miss the place",
          "Having been to Seaworld in Orlando, I can say that this had some exhibits superior to theirs. The dolphin show was a real joy and the beluga whale interaction with keeper was fab. A really enjoyable afternoon was spent here, highly recommended for families and adults alike.",
          "They have shows going through all day and it is very educational IF you understand Japanese. Although it seems tanks are too small for some species, it was wonderful place to visit to see marine animals that you usually don't have chance to see.",
          "It was fun for my kids and I did enjoy the place too. The dolphin performance was fun. The Beluga and Orca training (show) were education so it was a little less exciting to watch but they were adorable mammals. They all speak Japanese and for the aquarium part, all",
          "It is a small aquarium, but enough to keep the kids interested. Nice and easy to get to, and there is a shopping centre with food stalls.",
          "Fabulous place. Start early when it opens as there is so much to see. Great shows with so much to see. Can get busy at weekend so if you can get there during the week that's the best time. Some fantastic whales and dolphins. Just a must see.",
          "Having a jr pass we got on a shinkansen from Kyoto. Very easy to get to with 2 train transfers. Short walk from last stop. Aquarium is massive. Had never seen an orca or beluga whale and wasn't disappointed. Belugas had a training talk scheduled so we watched that first,",
          "A visit to the Port of Nagoya Aquarium is essential on every visit to Nagoya. The dolphin show is world class, the Beluga whales are beautiful and the Orca whales are amazing! The Aquarium is massive and has a large variety of sea creatures to look at. We thoroughly enjoyed our",
          "One of the best aquariums ever. So much to see and soo entertaining. Loved their killer whale show, they were so cute! Great place to visit when in Nagoya. Went during the week so it wasn't crowded. I was able to enjoy some quiet time.",
          "My wife and I brought our 2-year-old daughter here and it surprised us. The entrance floor has several huge tanks and there are 3-4 big dolphins and 3 big white whales. And then there are another 3 big killer whales coming out. We've been to a lot of aquariums but this one",
          "Nice jellyfish exhibit and good variety of fish. Should orcas and Beluga whales be kept in captivity?",
          "One of the best aquariums around. I suggest to reach early and see as many shows as possible. The best one is dolphins and saradines one.",
          "I love this place. I even don't remember how many times I went in this place. The fantastic performance of the dolphins makes it so enjoyable on your tour. You will see different kinds of sea animals. The aquarium is so beautiful.. you can also have sight seeing outside the",
          "Awesome place in Nagoya to visit whether alone or with family or with friends. Can experience the underwater life from your naked eyes. The main attraction being the Dolphin show which shouldn't be missed at any cost. Penguins, White shark are other attractions. The coral reefs",
          "The aquariums are well kept, very clean and the animals are healthy. Very informative and worth the trip",
          "We were pleasantly surprise on how big the place was. Even though when we got there there was already a large crowd, they were able to manage people going in and around the area. You can watch the orcas, dolphins and seals in two ways.. the outside open-air stadium where shows",
          "Dolphin show was great. Very good introduction to Marine life for kids. Parents also can enjoy a lot.",
          "Fun day out at this aquarium. Did not expect to see orcas there - watching Black Fish made me sad about seeing these majestic animals kept in enclosures. Good variety of sea life, probably one of the bigger aquariums I've been to. Loved discovering the clione limacina aka sea",
          "The best thing to do in Nagoya! Don't miss the main shows: dolphins and killer whales. They are so skilled and funny and lovely. I smiled the whole way back to the city center.",
          "Spent the day wandering all of the diplays from orcas to penguins to dolphins and sardines! Such a wonderius display of colors in the corals",
          "An easy journey on the subway found us at the aquarium which is located at the port in Nagoya. Entrance prices were reasonable. Your first port of call will be the dolphins, orca and beluga whales which were all a first for us. The viewing area for the dolphins was brilliant and",
          "Average in terms of things to see or do, compared to other aquariums in other cites. Not crowded. Walk in surrounding area / Port of Nagoya a relaxing experience in sunny weather with cherry blossom.",
          "There were mixed reviews for this aquarium. I have been the Osaka aquarium, which was larger, and so many other aquariums. However, the highlight features of the Nagoya Aquarium were the dolphins, and whales. The entrance showed bottoms of large dolphin, killer whales, and",
          "Good for an educational trip. I am personally a killer whales lover, therefor I am able to spend the whole day sitting in the middle / front of the cover to look at them the whole day. There are also show time for the dolphin and killer whales + others animals, do remember to",
          "An interesting way to spend a morning touring a Japanese ice breaker that completed many expeditions to Antarctica. There is also an observatory and aquarium.",
          "This place is nice for family bonding and educational trip.The place is about sea creatures and they are friendly to the people.They are very entertaining especially the dolphins for it has its own show that shows their talents or skills.No one cant like this place.No age is",
          "This was one of our itineraries during our latest Japan trip this March. I was surprised to see their massive tanks housing dolphins, killer whales, and other marine life. The view of these tanks from the ground level was pretty spectacular, especially that their carpets can",
          "As far as aquariums go, this one is one of the most ordinary I've been to and its a 2000Yen ticket. I've visited 2 in Tokyo, 1 in Yokohama, 1 in Numazu, and several in the US as well. Numazu is the only one I could say is worse, and only by a fraction. The layout of the",
          "We only have a few hours at the aquarium. While it's not very big, they have plenty to offer. The dolphin and orca shows are among others. They offer more than just entertainment. While I don't really agree with captivity, but the aquariums give my kid the best chances to see,",
          "You are very mistaken if you think this place is just another \"Ocean Park\". The place is totally dedicated to marine life and the exhibitions are carefully designed. The only drawback is the seemingly forceful establishment of visiting route, that it's slightly tedious to",
          "Loved seeing the beluga training and the penguins being fed; worth a visit for those two things alone. Dolphin show was cute (replays got a little irritating after a while!) Enjoyable and educational.",
          "Plenty of fishes to see and was impressed with the dolphin show. Although a bit far from Nagoya station it was still worth it to make the trip. We could even went out if the aquarium for lunch (Red Lobster was delicious!) and came back in again. Spent a good whole day at there",
          "For people enjoy to see animals trapped in cages or tanks is just fine experience, I particular find it sad, however when I came to Nagoya I was taken there for tourist attraction and it is an ok place, clean.",
          "The Nagoya Port area is beautiful, and the aquarium here is top notch! The dolphin show is one of the best that I've seen, the seal show was probably the cutest thing I will ever see, and all of the exhibit areas are absolutely beautiful! It is a little pricey but it's",
          "Its a beautiful place.. ticket cost 2000 yen. We went late missed the dolphin show . Last show ends by 1600 hrs.",
          "This place is enormous and has everything you can ask for. Countless of fish to see including heaps of events run daily from morning till night. It's one of two aquariums in Japan which has two Killer Whales as well. Restaurants on every floor, and children's den in case they",
          "We came here by train. Despite the rain it was crowded as it was a weekend. Please plan ahead so that you are able to see most of the shows. The shows were excellent especially the dolphins show. The highly intelligent beluga whales were entertaining. The killer whales show was",
          "From the subway station, the crowd seemed to be headed for the same direction, towards the Nagoya port. On reaching the entrance, it was a rush for the ticket counter. The exhibits, especially the Orca, dolphins and penguins were comparable to other large aquariums such as Sea",
          "The whole walk took us a few hours. We got entertained with the dolphin shows and each section was really entertaining not only for the kids but me too! Totally recommended for families with kids or friends or couples, just about anyone would enjoy this, unless water in tanks as",
          "Scenic setting in a harbor with interesting buildings and a large orange Antarctic research ship. The tanks with beluga whales and dolphins provide amazing up close views of those creatures. Many other exhibits about prehistoric sea creatures and evolution. Many smaller displays",
          "It was a great experience to this aquarium with a chance to see the live Orca swimming in a big tank. Great performance by the dolphins as well. The place is not to huge but with great exhibits. Worth a visit. Located just beside the port, nice environment and easily accessed by",
          "Cheaper and better than the one in Singapore (zoo and aquarium)! Here you can see killer whales and at least 15 dolphins performing. Lots of penguins and seals as well. Kids loved it!",
          "it was a good memory for my family especially to my grandson..lots of things that you can do...spacious parking space for everyone...there are good restaurants to eat...a day is not enough to go around.",
          "For a first to a aquarium I had a great time This place is bigger than what it seem With a dolphin show and there other main attractions. Follow the signs and they will lead you to the other part of the building where they have other fish tanks souvenirs stores. With many types",
          "very beautiful the Japan Center in city of Nagoya, is to chubu harbor I recommend you go with your children and with friends and make beautiful pictures, have fun",
          "It is my first time seeing an aquarium with shows of Dolphin and keeps orcas. They did shows about every two hours. The shows are interesting, but not much different from Dolphin shows elsewhere, except the pool is quite small with about 12 dolphins. I feel very sorry for",
          "Good show with dolphins, sea lions, whales. Interesting displays and setup. Children-friendly and educational. Great place for families.",
          "We arrived at the aquarium around 11 am. As we left I had the impression as that it was getting busier so I would recommend aiming for earlier in the day. The aquarium is organised around several huge tanks that you see again and again and you spiral lower, each time seeing a",
          "If you are in Nagoya, this place is a must! It's the biggest aquarium in Japan, the scale is different from any other aquariums!! Shows are brilliant and educating. This is not the most popular show, but make sure you don't miss Dance of Iwashi show. Mind-blowing.",
          "The Awuarium does a good job of showing.a large variety of species including several tanks with live coral.",
          "The dolphin show was nice, but not too remarkable.. The fish collection in seaworld jakarta (indonesia) was better that this..",
          "Went to the aquarium two hours before closing time and found it to be enough time to see the exebision and the dolphin show. Really nice exebitions. Worth a visit.",
          "Like any public aquarium the price is a bit high, $80 total for a family of four. It is a good stop though and we enjoyed the tour. Even without a show you can watch the dolphins and orca being trained. Likely to be crowded most of the time as there are other attractions",
          "you can witness there a variety of whales and penguins in a not-very-wide area (if you are interested in whales it will be your favorite there). However, what identify the aquarium there is the spectacular dolphin show simply it's A MUST SEE!",
          "The central area where you can see inside the big tanks is impressive and left my 2 year old jumping for joy. Leaving the issue of whether large aquatic mammals should be held in captivity they are still wondrous too see. I have been lucky enough to see some of these animals in",

          "Relatively big aquarium. Good exhibition. Worth a visit if you need to get away from ordinary nagoya. I'm not a fan of dolphins show but perhaps very good quality for those who likes.",
          "I had low expectations on this park since I've heard in Japan the respect for dolphins/whales isnt the same as in the West. However, I was disappointed in the lack of space for the killer whales, beluga whales. The dolphins did somehow get a large pool. There is little to no",
          "Very nice aquarium! With killer whales, dolphins and beluga whales! Also other nice bassins with beautiful fish. If you have an underground day pass, than you get 200 yen discount!",
          "We have visited many aquariums before and this one is one of the outstanding one. One of the unforgettable one is the Orca exhibit. The dolphin show was awesome too. There is also a area with very wide glass aquarium which is magnificent. This place really worth a visit. You",
          "We love fishes. We have been to many Aquariums in the world, such as in Osaka, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong ......This is a very small aquarium and not much to see. The place may be only satisfies by little kids. Even the dolphins show is so short and simple. Overall, not much",
          "A small place. Need about 30 mins of travelling time from city. 2 hrs shld be sufficient for a visit. Okinawa aquairum was far better than this.",
          "I loved seeing all the wonderful exhibits at the aquarium here in Nagoya! The whales, dolphins, sea lions, and fish were all spectacular. They had a great mix of everything and all the shows they put on were some of the best I had ever seen. The dolphin show with 11 dolphins was",
          "The aquarium was such an experience, especially for my son. We were able to watch the dolphin show and it was very entertaining. I was in awe seeing all the animals in this aquarium.",
          "Very small aquarium with not muck species of fish and other sea creatures. The main show is also boring. You can watch this kind of show in every aquarium that have dolphins. But the port is nice.",
          "The shows were very good and the displays were excellent. It is the largest aquarium I have ever visited. Very clean.",
          "I love all of the shows especially the seal show. Also the biggest tank in the middle of the building was very impressive",
          "The Park has many layers and levels. Multiple language maps & guides available. We went on anon-holiday weekday and crowd was quite small. many interesting displays, with a really great dolphin show! There are restaurants inside, but also a convenient pier-side food court just",
          "We've just passed an excellent moment in the aquarium. There are a lot of things to see. Orcas and dolphins, belugas and all fishes in the aquarium. The big turtle are impressed !",
          "It's worth taking time to the place as the aquarium is well-structure and fully equiped with many informative education tools. Very good for family with children. Noted that not many good restaurant and food options there, better bring bento or snacks. I love orca and penquins!",
          "Defiantly worth going to. Beautiful animals and spectacular displays. Not over priced \u00a54000 ($50aud). Good way to spend your afternoon. Only mins walk from subway.",
          "I liked it very much even I've been to a lot of aquariums at many places. The dolphin show is great and there also nice other events e.g. you can see training units of orcas and beluga whales. Also the turtles are nice. The section about sealife at Japanese sea is great. Just",
          "My six-year-old loves acquariums so this is a must do if you find yourself in Nagoya. The acquarium is located in the port area which is very bright and pleasant and not overly commercialized so it feels more local. the acquarium is huge, with a couple of sections. We enjoyed",
          "One thing I can tell is that the people look after these dolphines and killer whales very well because their skin are very healthy as compared to the dolphines in Singapore. The shows are magnificient and it keeps me in awe. The price is also reasonable. Never overcharging",
          "This aquarium is described as one of Japans most spectacular aquariums. In reality its all about the dolhins. Most of the things you see here is different views of the dolphin habitat. Make sure you are there for the dolphin show or else its not worth the entry fee. The dolphins",
          "A must see experience in the Port of Nagoya. Very easy access via the Subway, with many sea species, lots of knowledge and fun. The aquarium takes a whole day, with a re-entry permit. The performance shows are the favorite, especially for family outings. Great place for all ages!",
          "It's not a small aquarium, with 2 major blocks, south and North, plenty of marine species, big and small, seen and lots of seen for the first time. Good guiding route, very suitable for all ages, family or even single. White dolphins were very lovely, and could be seen in a very",
          "My favorite out of the aquarium I have visited. Honestly Osaka Aquarium is the best in terms of exhibits but here in Nagoya, the performances attract the visitors a lot. Go to the website of the aquarium and find the time table of performances. You have to use the Japanese",
          "Must go experience in Nagoya. Outstanding place to visit, with many sea species, a lot of knowledge and fun. The acquarium takes the one whole day. The dauphins is very fun and surprising. Family great attraction!",
          "Except dolphin show pool, most of the facilities are indoor. So you can enjoy even on rainy day. The aquarium also open on the new year's day. So if you stay in Nagoya over the year end, then this aquarium can be a good option to visit on January 1st.",
          "A fantastic aquarium. Spotlessly clean and organized. Awesome displays. The dolphin show was great. Beautiful Beluga whale exhibit. Very easy to get to on the subway. Let's you off right at the aquarium.",
          "The dolphin show was definitely a highlight, and also seeing the orca whales and penguins! We all enjoyed wandering around the place - although I wish the aquarium had more shows to offer. We skipped the movies since they were in Japanese. The place was spread out in two big",
          "Around the end of December, this is one of the few places that are actually open. There were lots of families there and it is a great place to take children. The dolphin show is spectacular (about 10 dolphins) and there are many interesting exhibits in the south wing. The",
          "Jam packed full of events and shows throughout the day. You'll be pressed if you want to see everything in one day. Dolphin show was excellent and white whales are cute as well. Only negative is thag food inside is average and seating is very limited. You can go in and out of",
          "A great aquarium. Love to watch the dolphin and orca shows. Do get the tickets that include two other museums and observatory. It's more worth it - just 400 yen more.",
          "Can't help but compare this to the Osaka aquarium. The highlight of Nagoya's aquarium is the dolphin performance. Entertaining and a joy to watch...really amazing the tricks these intelligent mammals can execute. A smaller side show is the Beluga's indoor performance. What was",
          "This aquarium is gorgeous, don't miss the dolphin's show! The giant pool with the whale sharks eating is an impressive show! Beautiful!",
          "This is my second visit to Kaiyukan Aquarium and it did not disappoint on both occasions. The aquarium is quite large and houses animals (not just aquatic ones) according to areas they are found. The enclosures could be brighter though cos it was difficult to see the details of",
          "Firstly, the aquarium is located quite a fair distance away from central Nagoya. Secondaly, the ticket prices are very high and, honestly, not worth it. The place doesn't have much exhibits and some of the exhibits are way too small to contain the animals inside. There are Orca",
          "This Aquarium stood out for having beluga whales and orcas which we don't get to see in other places. We love the beluga whales and orcas sessions where visitors can take a really close look at them. It was quite magical to see these creatures who seem to have good chemistry",
          "This is good for a couple of hours with the kids. It is a nice aquarium and the main tank with whale shark is awesome but it is not an all day place.",
          "Amazingly this is the first aquarium I've ever visited - looks like I started with the best! Quite expensive to get in, but once inside you'll realise its a bargain. It's fantastic! Whales and Dolphins on show, with space to live :-) . To watch them swimming underwater is",
          "aquarium with giant glass tanks that you can observe dolphins and beluca whales swim from under water. love the 'sardines storm', so fascinating",
          "This is large aquarium with indoor and outdoor tanks. The highlights are the dolphin and killer whale shows that take place at fixed times in the day. Great day out if you're into aquariums.",
          "This is in fact the best aquarium I ever visited! It houses a wide array of sea animals and I like the fact that you feel so close to these animals. Do catch the dolphin performance at the main pool (north building level 3)! Will definitely come back here if I'm in Nagoya again!",
          "I have watched many dolphin shows in Japan, but i like this aquarium one the most! It is at 2 pm everyday. The entrance fee is a little bit high, about 20$ but you will not regret. Take care when you take the subway to this aquarium, there are two lines, Meijo line and Meiko",
          "We went to the Nagoya Public Aquarium, after reading good reviews on TripAdvisor. Though the entrance price of JPY 2000 per adult seemed steep, we were awed by the ocra whales and the dolphins. The ocra whales wowed visitors with some tricks (like somersaulting, bowing,",
          "It was one of the best aquariums we have visited! Very helpful staff, although a little more English could have helped with communication. The performance was great, we all enjoyed the show very much.",
          "This place was great for the kids and adults alike. The dolphin show left us in awe. Seeing the creatures swimming around in the tank was also very mesmerizing. My little one enjoyed herself tremendously. We had a relaxing day at the aquarium. It was very easy and convenient to",
          "The displays were interesting but it is always Sad to see Dolphins, Whales and Turtles in Captivity. The place was extremely busy for a week day with 100's of school children running about the place.",
          "A short break on Sunday afternoon. Can spend many hours here. Nice show and i like the dolphin big glass tank. You can watch them closely and seems that the dolphins greet & play with you. Nice day !",
          "Great place shouldn't miss it, kill whale and dolphin's shows was awesome. Surrounding got anti Ship and tower is great time i spend here...",
          "Good place for kids and adults who has never been to an aquarium. Though, I feel sad for the trained dolphins. They should be in the sea, where they were born.",
          "Port of Nagoya Aquarium is really awesone. From Sakae st, we took Meijo Line to Kanayama st. And after that we took Meiko Line to Nogayako st. It only take 5 minutes walked from Nogayako st. The admission fee is only \u00a5 2.000. The white whales, tordano of sardiness and pinguins",
          "A nice aquarium to spend a few hours near the port of Nagoya. It has the usual collection of the aquarium fishes and performances by dolphins. The screen will play back the stunts by the dolphin after each jump so you won't miss any of the action from any angles seated in the",
          "I personally don't like animals in captivity but the aquarium is excellent for kids to visit. Other exhibits around the port also cater for children.",
          "The price might seem a bit high, but this aquarium has a lot to offer. Between the animals, the activities, shows, and petting time, this aquarium should really be visited. You can spend all day if you want.",
          "Big Aquarium with dolphins demonstration, orcas and pinguins. Staff very helpfull and infos in english.",
          "I had chance in the past to visit several aquariums in US and Europe. This one stands out for the large tanks with dolphins, orca whales, belugas and a large dolphin exhibition theater. I ended up accidentally at the museum as I was looking for the Scmaglev and Railway Park",
          "Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium from the city is about a 1 hour commute although my daughter who lives in Japan hired a car for the day. Even so, it does turn into a more than half day excursion so allow the best part of the day. The train journey is found here:",
          "Although animals looked relatively healthy and the water clean, there were far too many animals in one pool. 3 Orcas in such a time area. They didn't look too happy although clearly being treated well. Dolphons too.. far too many in one little pool and as for the penguins..",
          "LOVE the Dolphin show!! This is my first time encounter with dolphin. good show, well trained, happy, genius dolphins.",
          "Easy 7min walk from Nagoyako Station. It was ~$55 for our family of four. We went on a summer Sunday and the crowds were INSANE. The two cafeterias were packed with lines out to forever. Our ticket price included a dolphin show, which we skipped in favor of enjoying the amazing",
          "This place is not big but the attractions are top notch. go as early as you can to touch the dolphins. There is a small fee but its up close and personal with a dolphin. The Beluga and Killer whales are must see. Its great for family or on a Date. You will have fun.",
          "Arrived via subway from Nagoya station. Aquarium was a fantastic. Facility was large with many fascinating sea life pools. Dolphin show was thrilling to watch.",
          "They are the stars of the aquarium and rightly so. We went on a typhoon day and it was a day well spent. Just looking at the giant mammals at the north building along will take you two hours. Plan your route round the dolphin show and training times. The beluga and orca training",
          "There is just so much to love about this aquarium but the dolphin show is just brilliant. Amazes kids and adults alike.",
          "Nagoya Port Aquarium appears to be a huge attraction when viewed from outside, once inside it is much smaller and many of the attractions are housed inside the buildings. We found ourselves wandering between the two buildings and their various floors. The dolphins, killer",
          "I visited the aqaurium here instead of one in Osaka because of its higher rating. This is not a typical aquarium as there are killer whales and white whales shows as well as amazing dolphin show. It is near to Nagoyako subway station,the end of the line. If you have subway one",
          "i went with my son on a weekday. it was so fun! we watched the dolphin show and it was awesome. you would think that going there for how many times would be a bore but the staff makes you feel that its always a magical experience! i love it. mom and son date day well spent!",
          "The aquarium was great including the short dolphin show. We were short of time so did not have the chance to see everything. At least half a day would be necessary to appreciate everything. It would have been better if the labels on the featured sea creatures also had English",
          "Location: terminal station along subway Meiko line, and a good 7-minute walk to its ticket counter Attractions: dolphin show is a MUST. Professionally executed by its caring workers. Beluga white whales are an eye opener. Didn't manage to catch the Orca show. Exhibitions are a",
          "This is a great small aquarium. It had a lot to see and do. There was quite a bit about deep water sea life. The price included a visit to a boat museum that served in the Antarctic which was very cool. Worth a visit.",
          "You can easily spend half a day here. Make sure that you attend the dolphin show which is very impressive. They have killer and beluga whales, sea turtles, seals, etc. They have different shows throughout the day with different animals. It's easily accessible by the subway.",
          "Very fare on entrance fee, Good Dolphins show but lack of space to watch the Whales. Some confusion on the walk way, The Toilet is very old compare to other places in Japan. Good outdoor place to take picture and relax",

          "We went there in the afternoon around 14:30we entered the aquarium at that time because of the website shows that the closing time is 17:00.. But actually 16:30 on that day, even it was on the weekend.. It was a huge aquarium facility, but the information is very confusing",
          "We, my husband and I started to go to Nagoya Port when he was assigned for work in Japan, first as visitor in 2002 and then for three years as an expatriate. We loved going there to eat seafood at the nearby resto and then for the love of marine mammals we always go and see the",
          "not top of my choice while planning my itinerary. however we glad we were there. penguin walking (only in winter) is a big surprise, we didn't know before we went. if you have kids, you should bring them here!",

          "Fun and impressive aquarium. What I liked most about this aquarium was that we were able to observe the sea creatures in close proximity from different angles/locations, indoors & outdoors. The dolphin show, which showcased the natural abilities of these amazing animals, was",
          "A place for the young and old (more the young, actually). See dolphins and orcas up-close and tuna chasing after schools of sardines. Much of everything is explained in Japanese but there are enough English signs to guide you along. A very good few hours of sightseeing.",
          "Visited this very well-managed aquarium with my wife and two young kids. Extremely enjoyed it as one get the chance to see training of young Belugas in close view. Highly recommend all to visit this place. We felt happy throughout the visit; spent hours at this place but only",

          "A great aquarium with a nice range of animals. The real highlight for my partner and I was the antarctic area with four different species of penguins - Emperor, Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. We spent a long time in that area alone. The only real con, which is pretty common in a",
          "A place for all ages! you wont disappointed with Nogaya Public Aquarium as whatever at their website or leaflet, you will have all in real! The shows are amazing! Pay for one time payment but you gets unlimited re-entry within the same day. Best to buy full package which include",
          "You can catch meijo line to nagoya-ko station. Then just follow the signboard to the aquarium. I really enjoy the orca and beluga feeding time and dolphin show. Please remind to check on the feeding and show schedule. Good for family. Fee is \u00a52000 for adult n \u00a5500 for child.",
          "The day we went the place was buzzing with young families: judging by the attractions e.g. Dolphin show, this seems to be the target audience. The large aquariums gives one a great close up of Killer whales, dolphins and other denizens of the sea. Its staff is helpful and always",
          "I took a school group who enjoyed it immensely but I think that this is more a family attraction. There are dolphin shows and great displays and the staff are quite friendly. The young kids will love this place",
          "Pros: They had a large selection of animals and activities. There were several really nice exhibits and it was all really informative. They had some activity tanks where you could pet little sharks, and then they had some dolphin shows. Cons: Food was expensive, and the",
          "Enjoyed the aquarium. It is located down on the water and is fairly easy to get to by subway. They have a nice dolphin show. They also have orcas and beluga whales. Their sea turtle (loggerheads, I think) exhibit is very cool. The aquarium is very reasonably priced.",
          "has killer whales, dolphins, in addition to the fish other aquariums have. The tanks have been set up so you can actually see what's living inside of them, which isn't always the case in aquariums. Also, the fish tornado show and the mambo fish feeding were very entertaining.",
          "My son enjoyed the dolphin show! watched it 2x... we were early and was able to get a good seat... first we were at the upper most bleacher so we wouldn't get wet... on the second show we went closer. i would have enjoyed more if only i understand the language. :)",
          "The dolphin show is a must see. Also there is a presentation for the killer whale and also the beluga. A very nice place to visit when in Port of Nagoya. You can also get a package ticket that includes the Antarctic ship and the port observatory and museum.",
          "A great place to see beluga whales and orcas up close but you need to get a place to stand as the areas are small for the crowds. We were there at opening time and had seats for the dolphin show. It was also very good and our granddaughter who has just turned four loved it.",
          "Some friends and I spent a pleasant afternoon at the Port, and the aquarium was a lot of fun. Be aware that it closes early most days, so plan accordingly. There are many animals here that I would never see in \"real life.\" Did I say it was fun? I should have said intriguing.",
          "Sea world like experience, really nice, especially for kids. A great show of dolphins on an outer deck stadium as well as under the water. Not too crowded even I was there on a weekend. Costs 2000 yen for a person but the hotel I stayed in (Hilton) gave me a coupon for 1800",
          "Even though the entrance fee is high ie. at 2000 yen but it is still worth it. Wonderful to see the whales and dolphins.",

          "Having lived in Nagoya for almost two years I must admit that coming down to the Port was one of the most common thing to do when not traveling other places in Japan. The Aquarium is beautiful and I enjoyed all the free shows that were put on during the day. Is well worth the",
          "We visited the Aquarium on 27 Dec 2013, during our 2 days in Nagoya. Initially we didn't want to visit, but we didn't had much to do in Nagoya already, so we decided to come and see what's here in the Aquarium. It turns out to be a wise choice! We were very impressed with and",
          "This is not the best and biggest aquarium in Japan but you will still enjoy the time spending there. The dolphin show is a must watch and you will be amazed by the great performance from all those lovely dolphins. You can get closer to them by watching then practicing in the",
          "The admission is a little expensive, but it's worth it. You can easily spend over three hours here. It's amazing to be eye-level with dolphins, whales, and more. They had a wonderful dolphin show that cannot be missed. There are countless different species to see.",
          "It's good place to see many fish! If you visit here, you will find big fish,beatiful fish and a lot of animal! The show give happy to you and your family. But I think that entrance fee is so expensive! Don't you think?",
          "We had a conference dinner there. The show was great. We came from many countries. Dolphin trainers spoke Japanese. At the end Japanese professor apologized that the performance was in Japanese, but he mentioned that this language is not so difficult, because even the dolphins",
          "My family decided to head to Nagoya Public Aquarium because of the Dolphins shows, Orcas and Belugas. We were amazed by their beauty and there was a moment when an orca was having eye contact with me for more than a minute in the tank. We also enjoyed the show where we get to",

          "The aquarium has 2 buildings, one focus mainly on dolphins and whales seems to be newer. It was very enjoyable watching the dolphins and learned about their origin. Make sure you watch the impressive performance. I visited both Nagoya and Osaka Aquarium this trip, I definitely",
          "It's big, a little too distant from each section but nice anyway. We didn't spend much time with the dolphin show as my daughter is too young for it. She loved the rest, especially the beluga.",
          "Very good aquarium and a good range of animals to see. Very easy to get to by the subway and as it is closed to the port of Nagoya, you get great views from there. Weather wise it was not too hot with some breezes as it is closed to the port. If you hold a day pass subway",
          "The aquarium is big and full of families walking by. The attractions are the dolphins and whales as expected and the babies are very cute and used to people. Next to the Aquarium there is a museum and the ferris wheel which is beatiful in the night.",
          "Clean, easy to get to, animals seem well cared for. The Orca pool seemed very small which was quite upsetting to see (I really hope they had a bigger pool to go to \"behind the scenes\"). The Belugas were lovely and treated well, it was the highlight of the visit.",
          "You can find more than just fish in this aquarium. There are four orca here and you can catch the orca show at the main pool daily. Besides the orca show, there is also the dolphins show in which these smart little creatures can stun you with their impressive moves. A great",

          "If you believe that keeping animals in captivity is cruel then I wouldn't recommend this experience. But otherwise, don't miss this if you visit Nagoya. The dolphins, orcas, belugas and other sea creatures appear to be well fed and cared for and they put on an amazing show. The",

          "Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium is one of the best I've visited (the other being the Osaka Aquarium). The aquarium is split into two main buildings, the north building and south building. In the north building you'll find the dolphins and whales (belugas and orcas); the first",

          "The highlight of this Aquarium would be the Orcas. Do not miss the Orca show and also, do not miss the dolphin show. They are really spectacular. The aquarium might be very big but it attracts a lot of their locals. I had to queue for almost an hour on a Wednesday morning, so",
          "I have been to wonderful aquaria in Sydney, Monterey and in many places in the world. But I must say that the presentation of the Nagoya aquarium was perhaps the most impressive - the ceiling to floor plate glass separating you from the orcas, dolphins and beluga whales felt",
          "It is worth spending money and watching all the sea animals and their show. I really liked that place. If you have family and kids, do not hesitate just go and entertain. Everything is done only to watch and relax. Variety of attractions and different types of food will make you",

          "Other cities in Japan have better aquariums, but if you're in Nagoya for any length of time and looking for something to do, look no farther than the aquarium. It's pricey, as are virtually all aquariums. I think for two adults we paid about $50 (honestly we almost didn't go in",

        "wiki": "Nagoya (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02, Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region of Japan. It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1 million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of 6,923 persons per km2. Also as of December 2010 an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there\u2014a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of World War II in 1945.The area is 326.45 square kilometres (126.04 sq mi).  Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10 million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNagoya is the center of Greater Nagoya, which earned nearly 70 percent of Japan's 2003 trade surplus.\n\n\n=== Automotive industry ===\nNagoya's main industry is automotive. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus, Denso, Aisin Seiki Co., Toyota Industries, JTEKT and Toyota Boshoku have their headquarters in or near Nagoya. Mitsubishi Motors has an R&D division in the suburb of Okazaki. Major component suppliers such as Magna International and PPG also have a strong presence here. Spark plug maker NGK and Nippon Sharyo, known for manufacturing rolling stock including the Shinkansen are headquartered there.\n\n\n=== Aviation industry ===\nThe aviation history has historically been of importance since the industrialization. During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area. Robot technology is another rapidly developing industry.\nA materials engineering industry is developing.Brother Industries, which is known for office electronics such as multifunction printers is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, which is known for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment. Many small machine tool and electronics companies are also based in the area.The World Expo 2005, also known as Aichi Expo was held near Nagoya in the neighboring cities of Nagakute and Seto from March 25 to September 25, 2005.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nRetail is of importance in the city. Traditional department stores with roots in Nagoya are Matsuzakaya, Maruei and the Meitetsu Department Store. Oriental Nakamura was bought by Mitsukoshi from Tokyo in 1977.\n\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nThe Owari province was historically well known for the cloisonn\u00e9 art form. The Ando Cloisonn\u00e9 Company continues the long tradition.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Confectionery company Marukawa is well known.\nThe city offers venues for conferences and congresses such as the Nagoya Congress Center and the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nNagoya is served by Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO), built on an artificial island in Tokoname. The airport has international flights and a high volume of domestic flights.\nA second airport is Nagoya Airfield (Komaki Airport, NKM) near the city's boundary with Komaki and Kasugai. On February 17, 2005, Nagoya Airport's commercial international flights moved to Centrair Airport. Nagoya Airfield is now used for general aviation and as an airbase and is the main Fuji Dream Airlines hub.\nNagoya Station, the world's largest train station by floor area, is on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, and the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, among others. JR Central, which operates the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, has its headquarters there. Meitetsu is also based in Nagoya, and along with Kintetsu provides regional rail service to the T\u014dkai and Kansai regions. Nagoya Subway provides urban transit service.\nNagoya Port is the largest port by international trade value in Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation exports via this port.\nNagoya is known for its orderly grid street plan for which the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu is ultimately responsible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNagoya has mostly state-run primary and secondary schools. The area in the city limits includes international schools such as the Nagoya International School and Col\u00e9gio Brasil Jap\u00e3o Prof. Shinoda Brazilian school.State and private colleges and universities primarily located in the eastern area. Some Western-style institutions were founded early in the Meiji era, with more opening during the Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa eras. Nagoya University was set up in 1871 as a medical school and has produced six Nobel Prize laureates in science. Nanzan University was established by the Roman Catholic Society of the Divine Word in 1932 as a high school and expanded to include Nanzan Junior College and the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. The main campus was designed in the 1960s by the renowned architect Antonin Raymond. Some universities specialise in engineering and technology, such as Nagoya University Engineering school, Nagoya Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute; these universities receive support and grants from companies such as Toyota.\nOther colleges and universities include: Aichi Prefectural College of Nursing & Health, Aichi Shukutoku Junior College, Aichi Toho University, Chukyo University, Daido University, Doho University, Kinjo Gakuin University, Kinjo Gakuin University Junior College, Meijo University, Nagoya City University, Nagoya College of Music, Nagoya Future Culture College, Nagoya Gakuin University, Nagoya Management Junior College, Nagoya Women's University, St. Mary's College, Nagoya, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Sugiyama Jogakuen University Junior College, Tokai Gakuen Women's College. Various universities from outside Nagoya have set up satellite campuses, such as Tokyo University of Social Welfare.\nThe H\u014dsa Library dates to the 17th century and houses 110,000 items, including books of classic literature such as historic editions of The Tale of Genji that are an heirloom of the Owari Tokugawa and were bequeathed to the city. The Nagoya City Archives store a large collection of documents and books. Tsuruma Central Library is a public library and Nagoya International Center has a collection of foreign-language books.\n\nNational UniversitiesNagoya University (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5927\u5b66, Nagoya Daigaku)\nNagoya Institute of Technology (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5de5\u696d\u5927\u5b66, Nagoya K\u014dgy\u014d Daigaku)Prefectural UniversityAichi Prefectural College of Nursing & Health (\u611b\u77e5\u770c\u7acb\u770b\u8b77\u5927\u5b66, Aichi kenritsu kango Daigaku)\nNagoya City University (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, Nagoya shiritsu Daigaku)Private UniversitiesAichi University (\u611b\u77e5\u5927\u5b66, Aichi Daigaku)\nAichi Gakuin University (\u611b\u77e5\u5b66\u9662\u5927\u5b66, Aichi gakuin Daigaku)\nAichi Shukutoku University (\u611b\u77e5\u6dd1\u5fb3\u5927\u5b66, Aichi Shukutoku Daigaku)\nAichi Toho University (\u611b\u77e5\u6771\u90a6\u5927\u5b66, Aichi Toho Daigaku)\nChukyo University (\u4e2d\u4eac\u5927\u5b66, Ch\u016bky\u014d Daigaku)\nDaido University (\u5927\u540c\u5927\u5b66, Daid\u014d Daigaku)\nDoho University (\u540c\u670b\u5927\u5b66, D\u014dh\u014d Daigaku)\nKinjo Gakuin University (\u91d1\u57ce\u5b66\u9662\u5927\u5b66, Kinj\u014d Gakuin Daigaku)\nMeijo University (\u540d\u57ce\u5927\u5b66, Meij\u014d Daigaku)\nNagoya College of Music (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u97f3\u697d\u5927\u5b66, Nagoya Ongaku Daigaku)\nNagoya Gakuin University (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5b66\u9662\u5927\u5b66, Nagoya Gakuin Daigaku)\nNagoya Women's University (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5973\u5b50\u5927\u5b66, Nagoya Joshi Daigaku)\nNanzan University (\u5357\u5c71\u5927\u5b66, Nanzan Daigaku)\nSugiyama Jogakuen University (\u6919\u5c71\u5973\u5b66\u5712\u5927\u5b66, Sugiyama Jogakuen Daigaku)\nTokyo University of Social Welfare (\u6771\u4eac\u798f\u7949\u5927\u5b66, Tokyo Fukushi Daigaku)\nTokai Gakuen University (\u6771\u6d77\u5b66\u5712\u5927\u5b66, Tokai Gakuen Daigaku)\nToyota Technological Institute (\u8c4a\u7530\u5de5\u696d\u5927\u5b66, Toyota K\u014dgy\u014d Daigaku)\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nNagoya was a major trading city and political seat of the Owari lords, the most important house of the Tokugawa clan. They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the Shoin-zukuri architecture of the feudal era. Tokugawa Art Museum is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated national Treasures of Japan, including some of the oldest scrolls of The Tale of Genji.

Meiji Mura is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Showa eras. Another museum in Nagoya is the Mandolin Melodies Museum.\nOther museums in the city include the International Design Centre Nagoya, the Japan Spinning Top Museum and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum.\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"Cultural Path\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nNoh theatre and Ky\u014dgen date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The Nagoya Noh Theater at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's kabuki grand stages is Misono-za, which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\nIn 1912, the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the Nagoya harp music instrument.\nIn 1992, the large, modern Aichi Arts Center was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for performing arts, featuring a main hall that can be used for opera and theatre and a concert hall. The Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national festivals and holidays, other festivals in Nagoya are unique to the city/region.\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri (\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d, Street Performer's Festival) in \u014csu.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe Nagoya dialect (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01, Nagoya-ben) is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi).

It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1 million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of 6,923 persons per km2. Also as of December 2010 an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there\u2014a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of World War II in 1945.The area is 326.45 square kilometres (126.04 sq mi).  Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10 million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNagoya is the center of Greater Nagoya, which earned nearly 70 percent of Japan's 2003 trade surplus.\n\n\n=== Automotive industry ===\nNagoya's main industry is automotive. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus, Denso, Aisin Seiki Co., Toyota Industries, JTEKT and Toyota Boshoku have their headquarters in or near Nagoya. Mitsubishi Motors has an R&D division in the suburb of Okazaki. Major component suppliers such as Magna International and PPG also have a strong presence here. Spark plug maker NGK and Nippon Sharyo, known for manufacturing rolling stock including the Shinkansen are headquartered there.\n\n\n=== Aviation industry ===\nThe aviation history has historically been of importance since the industrialization. During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area. Robot technology is another rapidly developing industry.\nA materials engineering industry is developing.Brother Industries, which is known for office electronics such as multifunction printers is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, which is known for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment. Many small machine tool and electronics companies are also based in the area.The World Expo 2005, also known as Aichi Expo was held near Nagoya in the neighboring cities of Nagakute and Seto from March 25 to September 25, 2005.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nRetail is of importance in the city. Traditional department stores with roots in Nagoya are Matsuzakaya, Maruei and the Meitetsu Department Store. Oriental Nakamura was bought by Mitsukoshi from Tokyo in 1977.\n\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nThe Owari province was historically well known for the cloisonn\u00e9 art form. The Ando Cloisonn\u00e9 Company continues the long tradition.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Confectionery company Marukawa is well known.\nThe city offers venues for conferences and congresses such as the Nagoya Congress Center and the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nNagoya is served by Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO), built on an artificial island in Tokoname. The airport has international flights and a high volume of domestic flights.\nA second airport is Nagoya Airfield (Komaki Airport, NKM) near the city's boundary with Komaki and Kasugai. On February 17, 2005, Nagoya Airport's commercial international flights moved to Centrair Airport. Nagoya Airfield is now used for general aviation and as an airbase and is the main Fuji Dream Airlines hub.\nNagoya Station, the world's largest train station by floor area, is on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, and the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, among others. JR Central, which operates the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, has its headquarters there. Meitetsu is also based in Nagoya, and along with Kintetsu provides regional rail service to the T\u014dkai and Kansai regions. Nagoya Subway provides urban transit service.\nNagoya Port is the largest port by international trade value in Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation exports via this port.\nNagoya is known for its orderly grid street plan for which the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu is ultimately responsible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNagoya has mostly state-run primary and secondary schools. The area in the city limits includes international schools such as the Nagoya International School and Col\u00e9gio Brasil Jap\u00e3o Prof. Shinoda Brazilian school.State and private colleges and universities primarily located in the eastern area. Some Western-style institutions were founded early in the Meiji era, with more opening during the Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa eras. Nagoya University was set up in 1871 as a medical school and has produced six Nobel Prize laureates in science. Nanzan University was established by the Roman Catholic Society of the Divine Word in 1932 as a high school and expanded to include Nanzan Junior College and the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. The main campus was designed in the 1960s by the renowned architect Antonin Raymond.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed.

It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi). Dishes include: \n\nTebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori\nTenmusu: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp\nKishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.\nRed miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce and miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup)\nHitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as unadon, with spice and as chazuke.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe world premier of the first Godzilla movie was in Nagoya on October 27, 1954.

          "If you only plan to visit the tower, then its not worth it. Its just a tower in the middle of the park. But if you go around and shop in the area, then it should be fine.",
          "Nagoya TV Tower is the first radio tower built in Japan. 180 meter is the height of this tower and has a Sky balcony after reaching 100 meters of it\u2019s height.",
          "A came for Nagoya Matsuri Festival, so the city might have been brighter and more alive than normal. Hisaya Odori Park (where the tower is located) was full of live music, food vendors and other events, which is hopefully also a normal part of the appeal and attraction of the",
          "It was next to Oasis 21, so we visited the tower as well. From Oasis 21 it looked quite unimpressive, but up close it it is actually quite big. It is on the way from Oasis 21 to Sunshine Sakae, so worth a visit.",
          "This wasn't part of my itinerary but it's a few blocks away from my hotel. Seems the lights from the tower is inviting so even after a long day of walking and touring around couldn't resist making a turn and see the place. There are dining shops in the area where you can enjoy",
          "Right above Central Park, the tower can be seen from quite a distance. In the heart of Sakae. Cost is about 700yen for entry. I was there on a rainy Saturday afternoon but was a wonderful experience. Being the \"original Japanese TV tower\" certainly a step into recent history. No",
          "Located in central park area in Dakar. I didn't go up the tower, but just walked around at the bottom. There is a beer garden restuarant with outdoor seating at the base of the tower which seemed a busy place",
          "nice and you can see from almost all direction of Nagoya central city. it's beautiful in daytime and night. Not really a big tower but i like it because t is located in a nice area. Around the area, you can sit outside of the coffee shop or pub/bar and then enjoy the atmosphere.",
          "The tower itself is a must do experience but below the tower is the very nice Brooklyn Cafe with outdoor elevated terrance. Anything from food to beer and cappucino. After 17.00 one can drink at the beer tent and often there are eating and drinking festivals on around central",
          "Just had a look far from Oasis 21 in the afternoon. Probably a must-go photospot for a 1st time Nagoya traveller. Did not go up to the tower though.",

          "A landmark in Nagoya, it is near Oasis 21 and located within a park. The tower is impressive not only because of its height but also due to its location.",
          "I believe this tower was designed by the same designer as the Sapporo tower. They looked similar. Never been to the top of the tower personally. But I good place to take some good pictures.",
          "We paid 700 yen to go up to the deck- I wouldn\u2019t say it offers the best night view and would probably not go again. Oasis 21 can be seen from the tower. There is also a little \u201clove sanctuary\u201d 1 floor up from the observation deck, very average though.",

          "Nagoya TV Tower has it all: fantastic views, helpful landmark guides, and is very affordable. The observation deck has two levels - an interior floor with floor-to-ceiling glass, and an upper, outlide floor, bringing you clos to Nagoya's beautiful cityscape.",
          "This tower is not really something to go out of your way to visit unless you are a huge fan of radio towers. Since this tower was just a block a way from Sakae shopping area, we decided to drop by for some tourist pictorials.",
          "Nice place with the best view of Nagoya. You can see the best night view in this tower. The staff was friendly too",
          "The TV Tower and Oasis 21 is the famous tour location in Sakae near Nagoya. This is especially beautiful when in sunset and when the lights of both are on. The colors of lighting are keep changing and so give you a great colorful watching view. This view is especially good when",

          "Nice view. We went there some Saturday evening couple weeks ago. Beautiful when it\u00b4s clear and dark.",
          "This place is must when visiting Nagoya. The light show at night is very pretty. Near to many restaurants and bar. Easy access to train as well.",
          "Besides just seeing the view of Nagoya city, there was a show if you visited at night time. It's called the Sky Theatre in which two actors played a love story and there were some special effects of projecting the fireworks on the windows. The show attracted much crowd but was",
          "I been visit this area during day & evening time, both quite interesting esp take photo. enjoy beer a beer garden, the area with a park great place. it's funny i saw a lot of kids to wait for entrance it's funny . make sure visit oasis 21 too",
          "Highly recommend going at night for pretty lighting. Lots of restaurants and lots to do around the tower area. Very cool destination",
          "a great way to experience the expanses of Nagoya- we were there at night, as were 100's of noisy school kids but plenty of room and no problems - short walk from our hotel",
          "There was no queue and the view over nearby streets, the floral clock and the Oasis shopping centre was very good.",
          "We went to Nagoya TV tower during the sunset. It was beautiful to watch the sunset to all darkness when all the city is lit up. I'd recommend going to this tower see a view of the city if you're not pressed for time.",
          "This Tv tower is located in Sakae area of Nagoya city in Japan. It is adjacent to Oasis 21 and both look amazing in the night.",
          "This tower has nothing really to offer the usual tourist except a good city view at night. It represents the postwar boom when Japan was reaching its economic peak, so for this, it is an interesting historical piece to see. Kids enjoy going up to the top and if you just",
          "TV towers in Japan were money making off tourists. Theres at least one in every big city. I had seen so many TV towers and went up there to check out the view. We stayed at many high rise hotels in Japan that had great views, so we just skipped this one. Also the day was raining",
          "While this might be older and shorter than Sky Promenade (at Midland Square), the surrounding is more well planned with idea like US NY central parks nearby, so the view is rather unblock and unique",
          "It's right in the centre of sakae and very accessible, a good 20mins to spend time especially on a clear night to get a fairly decent city view. It's not very tall but can be beautiful on a clear night, and not too expensive to go up.",
          "The TV tower is prominently located in the city centre. We passed by it both day and night and we loved its night scene with the shinny lights on. It neutralize the traffic of cars and people passing by the busy area.",
          "Beautiful to see from outside, and it allows you to see how endless Nagoya's skyline can be, although there's not much to say beyond that.",
          "Great view over Nagoya. A bit expensive but still a nice ride up. We were there in the morning, it was not crowded.",
          "It was nice to go check this out at night time when I was exploring the city. It's quite small but still a nice sight.",
          "From the TV tower, it is possible to spot several landmarks of Nagoya with the southern part of Japan Alps in the background. The 1000 yen ticket is well worth. Access to the tower is from Sakae subway station or buses serving Sakae.",
          "As far as I read this is the very first TV Antenna in Japan. Nice to see, especially during the night, but way smaller that the others in Kyoto and Tokyo.",
          "Upon arrival we were told that there will be a fireworks and we could have a chance to see it at the top of the tower !!! Great Nice Timing !!! So, we bought tickets and went upstairs!! What a night ! There was just a fake fireworks from the visualizer hahahaahahahahahah",
          "Interestingly, the TV towers in japan seems to be tourist attractions. This one really looks similar to the one I saw in Sapporo. Good place to take some pictures as there is also a small garden beside it, just like the one at Sapporo.",

          "Amazing lights show during night time. One of the highlights of sakae. There are cafes at the area, it is also near and walking distance to oasis 21, and an underground shopping. It is easily accesible by subway and even by bus",
          "I didn't visit the viewing platform but this is located in Nagoya's big park. It's a beautiful setting, especially if you happen to score a cool evening. There is a decent open air bar / grill at the base of the tower.",

          "This attraction reminds your friends that you are in Japan. Almost every city have this tower. It is a nice place to spend a morning or afternoon. Just below it is a beautiful garden with blooming cherry blossoms and lovely flowers. Benches to sit and rest abound the area. There",
          "It is no longer used as a 'TV tower' sending out TV signals but still remains as one of the most significant landmarks of Nagoya. The tower and the park around are lit up after sunset every evening.",
          "We went at night 8pm on a Saturday. Perfect because there was not a large crowd. It was lit up and beautiful. We didn't go to the top, we want to go during the day to see the view. It's clean, safe and really pretty.",
          "Good place to visit after dark for photos, but pricey for a trip up the tower but the view is ok not a lot of people using the attraction when we were there.",
          "Great for seeing Nagoya. Lovely, reasonably priced restaurant underneath. Right next to Oasis 21. Go there at night and walk on the water filled roof. Mad photos.",

          "The tower provides an ideal place for stunning night views (360 degrees) of the whole of the Nagoya city, especially as the sun sinks. 10m up to the Lovers' Sanctuary, the cool breeze is awesome. A convenient to get night shots of Nagoya and its environs. Very easy access via",
          "Just another Japanese style tv tower. Nothing spectacular but ok to visit on a clear day if you might be in the neighbourhood",
          "near oasis 21 mall, great view of nagoya up top, good idea to visit at night too to see the lights, located at the central park too",

          "For small amounts 7000 Y up to 100m. Also the Park around the Tower is beautiful: a very nice look all over Nagoya, inkl. Castle and the Mountains/Vulcanos in the North",
          "Was there just in time for the LED show. The lift ride is a bit scary for claustrophobic and acrophobia. It's very windy, during winter, it's colder.",
          "nothing special during the day, but at night with the lighting is very pretty, can see it anywhere near the sakae area",
          "We have to take the lift to a lobby and then transfer to the deck floor ( about 90m) . The loft access is fast and service staffs are excellent and prompt . However generally it provides you with the overview of the city and the entire trip took less than 30 min .",
          "The tower is a relaxing view after you've worn out from your day tour. The light changes every now and then at night.",
          "Located at Central Park of Nagoya, this could be an ideal place for those seeking for sunset in Nagoya as its view is spectacular, especially as the sun sinks, you can observe the changes of light in four sides of the tower. Otherwise, there are not much things to do, if you're",
          "From here you can be minutes from all important places in Sakae. Sadly it is not a place that you need to make a point of visiting. However, there is a massive shopping mall below the tower.",

          "The tower is located next to a big pool of water with transparent glass floor. The oval-shaped pool can be accessed via a lift at the ground level, which is next to a bus stop for sightseeing. We were there almost noon time, the sun was bright and the reflection of the tower on",
          "I've only been up it in the day time, if I ever return to Nagoya, I've got to go at night. Great views and a lovely way to see Oasis 21 from another angle. We went up in the lift, but went down the stairs - that's one hell of an experience! I'm fit and not bothered by heights",
          "Did not have the opportunity to in/up, but viewed from the street I was delighted with all the colors and flashing light! Very beautiful!",
          "Its a 90 meter view which is only worth going at night as there is very little to see but the purple ring which looks impressive from the top.The cost is reasonable (700 for adults,300 for students & 600 for pensioners).",
          "Saw this as I was walking the streets in Nagoya. It's a nice landmark for the city and definitely an eye-catcher at night when it lights up, but my family that lives in Nagoya didn't know much about the landmark to inform me, which didn't spark my curiosity to visit the tower,",
          "Nagoya Tower is a nice place to visit especially at night, when the city lights are on it will be a nice view up the tower. You will also see Oasis 21 from above which is nice to look at when all lit up.",
          "The tower is not so high that the night view was not so fabulous. But it's nice place to drop by at night.",
          "Exactly as the title says, this place is nothing special. it is like an eiffel tower, but just not as magnificent. Really something that you can give a miss if you visit Nagoya. Still the \"park\" around it is a nice place to get away from the shopping, but definitely could use a",
          "Not a must come place. A photo or 2 from far will do. It's nice but not a big deal if you missed it.",
          "Suggest to take picture of Nagoya TV tower at night from Oasis 21. Lighting of Nagoya TV tower is attractive.",
          "I liked the view from the tower observation and took quite a few photos.I would recommend it as part of a tour of Nagoya.",
          "Someone used to said Nagoya TV Tower resembles Eiffel Tower. I have no idea because I never been to Paris. But when I looked at it, yeah, it's nearly similar",
          "A very good place be if you want a 360 degrees view of the city. The view deck is at 90 M height. There is Cafe' and souvenir shop at the bottom of tower. The Eiffel tower of Nagoya. Adjacent to Oasis 21 ( A bus station and mall ).",
          "Very cool area to visit, the tower of course looked cool. Lots of shopping in the area and plenty of other things to do.",

          "Although it's quite touristic it's also essential to know and see the whole city from above. You can also buy some merchandising after the visit.",
          "Japan's oldest TV tower (dating back over half a century!) is basically an e Eiffel-like tower with two observation decks and a restaurant. While it's certainly not worth to visit the observation decks (as the tower is not tall at all), the tower does look lovely after dark and",
          "take your picture of Nagoya Tv Tower from the skydeck of Oasis 21. Beautiful deck plus colored lights of nagoya tv tower equals perfect picture!",

          "View, A great dine in cafe in the park where it is located , Spend atleast 2 hours in the park for real feel",
          "The trip up the Tower and the view out over Nagoya is well worth the effort. The view is hindered by Glass panels which is a pity from a photography point of view but I can understand why from a health and safety perspective.",
          "We found name plates that was filled with love. The wedding anniversary! The scenery is beautiful. We were feeling good. But it depends on the weather.",
          "The tower is a landmark in Sakae. It's not as high as other towers in the world but it provides decent height and offers great views. I recommend to take stairway to go down, which would be a nice experience.",
          "If you're around Sakae station, you will not miss this landmark. The lights at night is quite nice, apart from it nothing extraordinary, but still pleasant and picture-taking worthy I guess.",
          "Easy to recognize the direction when you shopping around. There were some shows by the fashioned mordern youngers such as singing, music..etc",
          "The view during night time was fantastic! Ignoring the winter wind that blows and freeze us up, we climbed up to the roof of Oasis 21 nearby the tower and the view was stunning! A must visit place when in Nagoya!",
          "Visited Nagoya 3x, me and my husband had so may pictures in this tower. It's in the middle city of Nagoya CBD. Facing flies tower is like a park , very longpark. On our 2 weekend stayed in Nagoya there is a festival and lots of stall. It is worth visiting this Tower because",

          "We did not visit the TV tower but past it on our way to the Nagoya Castle. WE saw the tower and just kept walking until we found the castle. People on the street are very friendly and help visitors in every way that the can. Nice city.",
          "View from Nagoya TV Tower is nothing spectacular and is obstructed by bars. It is kinda nice, but in Japan you have much better towers to visit (SkyTree in Tokyo, Umeda Sky building in Osaka, etc). But if you are in the vicinity and want some overall view of the city, go there.",
          "After some shopping, this was a relaxed lunch venue. Well worth a visit even just for the views. I liked the calm feeling in this venue. Nothing is hurried, you can enjoy the views at your leisure. The new bust station is just opposite, so easy to et to.",
          "I really made sure to visit this place during my visit in Nagoya. I did enjoy seeing the entire Nagoya from a bird's eye view. I highly recommend that you too visit this place and I know you will surely enjoy it.",
          "Great view from the top. Lots of nice stuff to see around, shops in the Sakae sunshine mall, a sort of stadium, 2nd floor with water on transparent ceiling. Not expensive too.",
          "It is smaller than the Tokyo TV tower but worth going. You get some good views from the high section of the tower. Once outside the tower you can shop for hours. There are plenty of department stores and restaurants. Very safe to walk around at nights too. Typically Japanese,",
          "It\u00b4s a great place, right in the center of Sakae, at Central Park Station. Old but well preserved, you can go up andhave a very beautiful view from the neighborhood, get souveniers and have a meal right there. It is very cheap too.",
          "i visited there in july, 2013 in the evening after sun went down with my bf. i was expecting sucha a great night view from the top of the tower, but no doubt.. there's toally nothing to see.. the way why i felt that way is just because i went up there after SKYTREE in tokyo,",

          "There is not much of a view, nothing else to do up there. Done in 15 minutes only. 700 yen is too steep",

          "Luckily our hotel was near this tower, so we went up to the top of this tower. It was night time, so we could only see typical night view of city. It was nothing special. I think it's better to go up there day time.",
          "Nagoya TV tower offers a beautiful view on the city. Look at the spaceship down on the ground: this is Oasis 21. Go there and just take a walk on the stunning glass roof filled with water.",
          "The Nagoya TV Tower is very near the Sakae station, and it is a lovely landmark. Though it cannot be compared to the Tokyo Tower or the Eiffel Tower, nonetheless, it is still something splendid. It's also near to the Oasis 21 shopping mall, so if you were shopping, you could",
          "Nice views but I found it expensive. 600 yen for adults and 300 yen for kids. They offer discount to Meguro tourist bus pass or Subway/Bus day pass holders. We originally wanted to go to Nagoya Higashiyama Sky Tower but it was closed. It's much taller, observation deck at 180m",
          "A spot for having the city view in Sakae I recommend go their near sun set time, so that you get view both day and night view Located at a park, so that you can have good sceenery when you are looking from the tower to outside, or looking at the tower from the ground",

Near the tower, there is a deck-like thing, called Oasis 21, where you can enjoy an awesome scenery of the city and the tower. \nHowever, I also suggest you have a good camera, as I don't think a normal phone would be able to capture what you desire. (Just saying)",

          "It was an interesting place to see. Good observation of the area from inside it. Neat shops in the area. It was a relaxing place to explore a little bit. It well worth the 700 yen fee to go and see. The staff were super nice. It was a great value for the money.",

        "wiki": "The SCMaglev (superconducting maglev, formerly called the MLU) is a magnetic levitation (maglev) railway system developed by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and the Railway Technical Research Institute.On 21 April 2015, a manned seven-car L0 Series SCMaglev train reached a speed of 603 km/h (375 mph), less than a week after the same train clocked 590 km/h (370 mph), breaking the previous land speed record for rail vehicles of 581 km/h (361 mph) set by a JR Central MLX01 maglev train in December 2003.\n\n\n== Technology ==\n\nThe SCMaglev system uses an electrodynamic suspension (EDS) system. Installed in the trains' bogies are superconducting magnets, and the guideways contain two sets of metal coils.\nThe current levitation system utilizes a series of coils wound into a \"figure 8\" along both walls of the guideway. These coils are also cross-connected underneath the track.\nAs the train accelerates, the magnetic fields of its superconducting magnets induce a current into these coils due to the magnetic field induction effect. If the train were centered with the coils, the electrical potential would be balanced and no currents would be induced. However, as the train runs on rubber wheels at relatively low speeds, the magnetic fields are positioned below the center of the coils, causing the electrical potential to no longer be balanced. This creates a reactive magnetic field opposing the superconducting magnet's pole (in accordance with Lenz's law), and a pole above that attracts it. Once the train reaches 150 km/h (93 mph), there is sufficient current flowing to lift the train 100 mm (4 in) above the guideway.These coils also generate guiding and stabilizing forces. Because they are cross-connected underneath the guideway, if the train moves off-center, currents are induced into the connections that correct its positioning.\nSCMaglev also utilizes a linear synchronous motor (LSM) propulsion system, which powers a second set of coils in the guideway.\n\n\n== History ==\nJapanese National Railways (JNR) began research on a linear propulsion railway system in 1962 with the goal of developing a train that could travel between Tokyo and Osaka in one hour. Shortly after Brookhaven National Laboratory patented superconducting magnetic levitation technology in the United States in 1969, JNR announced development of its own superconducting maglev (SCMaglev) system. The railway made its first successful SCMaglev run on a short track at its Railway Technical Research Institute in 1972.\n\n\n=== Miyazaki test track ===\nIn 1977, SCMaglev testing moved to a new 7 km test track in Hy\u016bga, Miyazaki. By 1980, the track was modified from a \"reverse-T\" shape to the \"U\" shape used today. In April 1987, JNR was privatized, and Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) took over SCMaglev development.\nIn 1989, JR Central decided to build a better testing facility with tunnels, steeper gradients, and curves. After the company moved maglev tests to the new facility, the company's Railway Technical Research Institute began to allow testing of ground effect trains, an alternate technology based on aerodynamic interaction between the train and the ground, at the Miyazaki Test Track in 1999.\n\n\n=== Yamanashi maglev test line ===\n\nConstruction of the Yamanashi maglev test line began in 1990. The 18.4 km (11.4 mi) \"priority section\" of the line in Tsuru, Yamanashi, opened in 1997. MLX01 trains were tested there from 1997 to fall 2011, when the facility was closed to extend the line to 42.8 km (26.6 mi) and to upgrade it to commercial specifications.\n\n\n== Commercial use ==\n\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn 2009, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism decided that the SCMaglev system was ready for commercial operation. In 2011, the ministry gave JR Central permission to operate the SCMaglev system on their planned Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen linking Tokyo and Nagoya by 2027, and to Osaka by 2045. Construction is currently underway.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nSince 2010, JR Central has promoted the SCMaglev system in international markets, particularly the Northeast Corridor of the United States, as the Northeast Maglev. In 2013, Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe met with the 44th U.S. President Barack Obama and offered to provide the first portion of the SC Maglev track free, a distance of approximately 40 miles. In 2016, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded $27.8 million to the Maryland Department of Transportation to prepare preliminary engineering and NEPA analysis for an SCMaglev train between Baltimore, MD, and Washington, DC.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn late 2015, JR Central partnered with Mitsui and General Electric in Australia to form a joint venture named Consolidated Land and Rail Australia to provide a commercial funding model using private investors that could build the SC Maglev (linking Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne), create 8 new self-sustaining inland cities linked to the high speed connection, and contribute to the community.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\n1972 \u2013 LSM200\n1972 \u2013 ML100\n1975 \u2013 ML100A\n1977 \u2013 ML500\n1979 \u2013 ML500R (remodeled ML500)\n1980 \u2013 MLU001\n1987 \u2013 MLU002\n1993 \u2013 MLU002N\n1995 \u2013 MLX01 (MLX01-1, 11, 2)\n1997 \u2013 MLX01 (MLX01-3, 21, 12, 4)\n2002 \u2013 MLX01 (MLX01-901, 22)\n2009 \u2013 MLX01 (MLX01-901A, 22A: remodeled 901 and 22)\n2013 \u2013 L0 Series Shinkansen\n2020 \u2013 Revised L0 Series Shinkansen\n\n\n== Records ==\n\n\n=== Manned records ===\n\n\n=== Unmanned records ===\n\n\n=== Relative passing speed records ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nMAGLEV 2000\nTransrapid\nKrauss-Maffei Transurban - Electromagnetic suspension technology had been transferred from Krauss-Maffei.\nROMAG\nInductrack\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

          "Closed to 17th March 2020, or longer, in cause of Corona !",
          "Nice museum, worth the entry price. Most things are explained in English as well, but some details are missing. Best experience for me was the train driver simulator. A ~10 minute game is just 100\u00a5.\nThe JR people have the funny habit of overexaggerating the beauty of the color scheme of their trains.",

          "Shows all the shop a Shinkansen trains in history.\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Good but doesn't hold up to expectations especially given that it is out if the way. Nice add on to a trip to Legoland though if you have a couple of hours to spare. Found the MAGLEV part lacking.",
          "Great exhibition. Full of information and history. Friendly staffs. The JR diorama is a must see.",
          "If you have any children who love trains this place has it all and not terribly busy due to its location I would guess. My son went crazy there for about 2-3 hours. Lots to see and do",
          "Don't miss it.\n\nIf you want to know more about the world -renowned Shinkansen train as well as the history of japanese train, this place will give you a lot of informations and the chance to inspect the real trains.\n\nThe train diorama which takes up the whole room was very impressive.",
          "If you're a train enthusiast then this place is for you. It shows all the train Japan has used including the one they use now (Nozomi).\n\nDo note that if you're coming by car, you'll have to find a separate parking space as the facility itself doesn't have a parking lot",

          "A must go place for all train lovers!",
          "Amazing place, but sadly you won't get to operate the train simulators unless you win the lottery system there base on your ticket. Still 5 starts for families to learn about Shinkensen, Japanese rail and maglev even a child can understand.",
          "Awesome museum for Japanese train",
          "Fantastic to see the evolution of trains in Japan, Legoland just over the bridge a good place to visit.",

          "Amazing train exhibition, I thought it was just going to filled with bullet trains but they had plenty of variety. Also one of the best train diroamas Ive seen.  It's about 30-40 min train ride on the aonami ride.",

          "Easy to find, and very informative. We were lucky enough to win the lottery for the N700 driving simulator and it was a fantastic experience. \n\nThe area on ticketing was one of the only exhibits without any English which was a shame, but the rest of the exhibits were easy to follow.",
          "This is definetly a place to visit in Nagoya. Especially if you love train about the history and the recent technology. There are simulators you should try. Looking at all the trains and one by one will make you forget that you have spend hours enjoying this place.",
          "The newer trains were so interesting for me, but they had a few older ones too. Not super old, but old enough to have an antique feel to them! They also had a miniature replica of the Tokyo area made of small figurines. They had the miniature trains operating too. Very cool to see.",

          "It is right next to the LEGO LAND NAGOYA. However, I do not recommend to visit both places at once. \nIf your kid has ever been interested in trains, you must bring him there. It is a fantastic place but does please your lunch box with you \u2026",
          "I thought this museum would only hold my interest for a few minutes, but it really had a wide range of train exhibits. I appreciated all the hands-on items including a real throttle hooked into a full-size train bogie (motor/wheel frame) you could spin, and a shinkansen pilot simulation.",

        "wiki": "Noritake Co., Limited (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30ce\u30ea\u30bf\u30b1\u30ab\u30f3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ea\u30df\u30c6\u30c9, Kabushiki-gaisha Noritake Kanpan\u012b Rimitedo), commonly known as \"Noritake,\" is a tableware and technology company headquartered in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1876, Ichizaemon Morimura VI and his brother Toyo founded Morimura Gumi with the intent of establishing overseas trading by a Japanese company. By 1878, Toyo had established a business in New York selling Japanese antiques and other goods, including pottery. The company was renamed Morimura Brothers in 1881. By the 1890s, the company had shifted from retail to wholesale operations and started working on design improvements for the pottery and porcelain ware, which had become one third of its business. By 1899, all of the pottery and porcelain decorating factories in Tokyo and Kyoto had been consolidated in Nagoya, and the company started research on creating European style hard white porcelain in Japan.In 1904, key members of this trading company created the Nippon Toki Kaisha, Ltd. (\"the Company that makes Japan's Finest China\") in Japan. A new factory was built in Noritake, near Nagoya (now Noritake-shinmachi, Nishi-ku, Nagoya, Aichi). In 1914 the company succeeded in creating their first Western style dinner set, called \"Sedan\", to compete with European porcelain companies. Nippon Toki wares were mostly aimed at the European Market. This forerunner of the modern Noritake Company was founded in the village of Noritake, a small suburb near Nagoya, Japan. Most of the company\u2019s early wares carried one of the various \u201cNippon\u201d back stamps to indicate its country of origin when exported to Western markets. Today, many collectors agree that the best examples of \u201cNippon-era\u201d (1891\u20131921) hand painted porcelain carry a back stamp used by \"Noritake\" during the Nippon era.\n\nBy 1923, Nippon Toki was looking to streamline its paperwork using machines to handle large orders coming in from the United States, and was impressed by the Hollereth tabulating machines manufactured by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). In May 1925, Morimura-Brothers entered into a sole agency agreement with CTR (which had been renamed IBM in 1924) to import the Hollerith machines into Japan. The first Hollerith tabulator in Japan was installed at Nippon Pottery in September 1925, making Noritake IBM customer #1 in Japan.In 1939, Noritake started selling industrial grinding wheels based on its porcelain finishing technology. It now provides ceramic and diamond grinding and abrasive solutions for many industries. Other products currently manufactured by Noritake, also derived from its core tableware manufacturing technologies, include thick film circuit substrates, engineering ceramics, ceramic powder, and vacuum fluorescent displays, as well as heating furnaces and kilns, mixing technology, filtration systems, and cutting and grinding machines.Although consumers and collectors alike have called the tableware, \"Noritake\" (and/or simply, \"Nippon\") since the late 1920s, the Japanese parent company did not officially change its name to the Noritake Co., Limited until 1981. Evidently, since Noritake is the name of a place, the company was initially prohibited from registering the name as a trade name.<The Noritake Garden in Nagoya features the production of its ceramics.\n\n\n== Overseas ==\nAustralia\nNoritake Australia Pty Ltd was established in 1958 and it is owned by Noritake Co., Limited. By the late 1960s Noritake brand had become a household name. Noritake is an official in-flight supplier to Qantas Airways and the brand has worked together with the airline and Australian designer Marc Newson to create a crockery range for Qantas International First and Business. Noritake Australia also distributes industrial grinding wheels in the Australian market.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nNeff Alden, Aimee, Collector Books.

        "wiki": "\u014csu Kannon (\u5927\u9808\u89b3\u97f3) is a Buddhist temple of the Shingon sect located in \u014csu, in central Nagoya, Japan. It belongs to the Owari Thirty-three Kannon.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe official name is Kitanosan Shinpuku-ji H\u014dsh\u014d-in, but is popularly known as \u014csu Kannon.\nThe temple was originally built in about the year 1333 in \u014csu-g\u014d, Nagaoka village, in Owari Province, which is currently known as the city of Hashima in Gifu Prefecture. Construction was sponsored by the Emperor Go-Daigo, who appointed Sh\u014dnin N\u014dshin as the first head priest. N\u014dshin had a dream of Avalokitesvara, the Buddha of Compassion, known as Kannon in Japanese.\nHence, the name \u014csu (from \u014csu-g\u014d) Kannon. Due to repeated flooding, the temple was moved to its present location in 1612 by Tokugawa Ieyasu. In the 1820s, large parts of the temple were destroyed by fire, but it was rebuilt in the 1970s. The main hall has a very large, red paper lantern hanging from the ceiling where worshipers can tie small paper notes with wishes to the holding wires. \n\n\n== Library ==\nThe current temple is home to a large collection of books. It houses about 15,000 classic Japanese and Chinese works. The Records of Ancient Matters (\u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18 Kojiki), a Shinpukuji manuscript (\u771f\u798f\u5bfa\u672c) transcribed by the monk Ken'yu (\u8ce2\u745c) is the oldest extant manuscript of the Kojiki and consists of three books that were written in 1371\u20131372 during the Nanboku-ch\u014d period. It describes the ancient mythological history of Japan. The library also has many other books designated as national treasures and important cultural properties.\n\n\n== Market ==\nA street fair is held on the 18th day of each month. A number of antiques are sold there. \nThe nearest subway is \u014csu Kannon Station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin, a temple nearby\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPictures of the temple\nJapan-guide.com\nExpo2005.or.jp\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to \u014csu Kannon at Wikimedia Commons\n\nHomepage of \u014csu Kannon",

It features a shopping center with 60 name-brand stores, two automobile showrooms and a cinema. It also holds the record for the highest open-air observation deck in Japan. Also of note are the unusual double-floored elevators, which take only 40 seconds to rise to the top.\nThe name of the building derives from the Ch\u016bbu region (which means \"central region\") of which Nagoya is the capital.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Midland Square at Wikimedia Commons\n\n(in Japanese) Midland Square, official site",

        "wiki": "Nagoya (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02, Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region of Japan. It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1 million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of 6,923 persons per km2. Also as of December 2010 an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there\u2014a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of World War II in 1945.The area is 326.45 square kilometres (126.04 sq mi).  Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10 million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNagoya is the center of Greater Nagoya, which earned nearly 70 percent of Japan's 2003 trade surplus.\n\n\n=== Automotive industry ===\nNagoya's main industry is automotive. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus, Denso, Aisin Seiki Co., Toyota Industries, JTEKT and Toyota Boshoku have their headquarters in or near Nagoya. Mitsubishi Motors has an R&D division in the suburb of Okazaki. Major component suppliers such as Magna International and PPG also have a strong presence here. Spark plug maker NGK and Nippon Sharyo, known for manufacturing rolling stock including the Shinkansen are headquartered there.\n\n\n=== Aviation industry ===\nThe aviation history has historically been of importance since the industrialization. During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the Shoin-zukuri architecture of the feudal era. Tokugawa Art Museum is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated national Treasures of Japan, including some of the oldest scrolls of The Tale of Genji. The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of Noh theatre. The Nagoya City Museum showcases the history of the town.\nY\u014dki-s\u014d is a villa and gardens located in Chikusa-ku, close to Nittai-ji. It was constructed in the Taish\u014d era for Ito Jirozaemon Suketami XV, the first president of Matsuzakaya.\nPaintings and sculpture are exhibited at the Nagoya City Art Museum. Modern art is displayed at the Aichi Arts Center. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts, a sister museum to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.\nThe art of porcelain and ceramics can be seen at the Noritake Garden. Toyota has two museums in the city, the Toyota Automobile Museum which shows vintage cars, and the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology, which showcases company history, including its start as a textile mill.\nThe Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum has trams and subway cars, as well as the Nagoya City Science Museum.

Another museum in Nagoya is the Mandolin Melodies Museum.\nOther museums in the city include the International Design Centre Nagoya, the Japan Spinning Top Museum and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum.\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"Cultural Path\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nNoh theatre and Ky\u014dgen date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The Nagoya Noh Theater at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's kabuki grand stages is Misono-za, which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\nIn 1912, the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the Nagoya harp music instrument.\nIn 1992, the large, modern Aichi Arts Center was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for performing arts, featuring a main hall that can be used for opera and theatre and a concert hall. The Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national festivals and holidays, other festivals in Nagoya are unique to the city/region.\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri (\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d, Street Performer's Festival) in \u014csu.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe Nagoya dialect (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01, Nagoya-ben) is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi). Dishes include: \n\nTebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori\nTenmusu: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp\nKishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.\nRed miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce and miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup)\nHitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as unadon, with spice and as chazuke.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe world premier of the first Godzilla movie was in Nagoya on October 27, 1954. The city, especially Nagoya Castle, has been featured in three other Godzilla movies: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, and Godzilla vs. Mothra. The city is also featured in Gamera vs. Gyaos and is the main setting of 2003 film Gozu. The 1995 film The Hunted starring Christopher Lambert and the 1992 film Mr. Baseball starring Tom Selleck were also filmed in the city.\nThe city was the setting for the 2007 movie Ashita e no yuigon (translated as Best Wishes for Tomorrow), in which a Japanese war criminal sets out to take responsibility for the execution of U.S. airmen. The anime The Wind Rises by Hayao Miyazaki, released in 2013, is a highly fictionalized biography of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero's chief engineer Jiro Horikoshi and takes mostly place in Nagoya of the 1920s and 1930s. Nagoya is also the setting for the manga and anime series Yatogame-chan Kansatsu Nikki, which highlights many of the sites and traditions of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nNagoya is home to several professional sports teams:\n\nIn 2007, the Chunichi Dragons won the Japan Series baseball championship. In 2010, Nagoya Grampus won the J. League championship, their first in team history. Nagoya is also the home of the Nagoya Barbarians semi-pro rugby football club.\nA honbasho sumo tournament is held every July at the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium. The city has hosted The Crowns golf tournament since 1960 and the women's Nagoya Marathon since 1984.\nIn September 2016 the city was awarded the right to host the 2026 Asian Games after it was the only city to lodge a bid. It will be the third time Japan hosts the event after Tokyo in 1958 and Hiroshima in 1994.The city hosted the official 1979 Asian Basketball Championship. Later, it became one of the host cities of the official Women's Volleyball World Championship for its 1998, 2006 and 2010 editions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nThe Nagoya International Center promotes international exchange in the local community. It houses the U.S. Consulate on the 6th floor and the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) on the 7th floor.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nNagoya is twinned with five cities around the world:\n Los Angeles, United States (affiliated April 1, 1959)\n Mexico City, Mexico (affiliated February 16, 1978)\n Sydney, Australia (affiliated September 16, 1980)\n Turin, Italy (affiliated May 27, 2005)\n Reims, France (affiliated October 20, 2017) The sister city relationship with Nanjing in China was suspended in February 21, 2012, following public comments by Nagoya mayor Takashi Kawamura denying the Nanking Massacre.\n\n\n=== Partner cities ===\n Taichung, Taiwan (affiliated October 25, 2019)\n Tashkent, Uzbekistan (affiliated December 18, 2019)\n\n\n=== Sister ports ===\nNagoya's sister ports are:\n\n Los Angeles, United States (1959)\n Fremantle, Australia (1983)\n Baltimore, United States (1985)\n Antwerp, Belgium (1988)\n Shanghai, China (2003)\n Sydney, Australia (2010)\n Bruges, Belgium (2013)\n\n\n=== Sister Airport ===\nNagoya's sister Airport is:\n\n Grant County International Airport, United States (2016)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sightseeing ==\n\nNagoya's two most famous sightseeing spots are Atsuta Shrine and Nagoya Castle.\nAtsuta Shrine is the second-most venerable shrine in Japan, after Ise Grand Shrine.

        "wiki": "Nagoya (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02, Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region of Japan. It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1 million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of 6,923 persons per km2. Also as of December 2010 an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there\u2014a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of World War II in 1945.The area is 326.45 square kilometres (126.04 sq mi).  Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10 million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNagoya is the center of Greater Nagoya, which earned nearly 70 percent of Japan's 2003 trade surplus.\n\n\n=== Automotive industry ===\nNagoya's main industry is automotive. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus, Denso, Aisin Seiki Co., Toyota Industries, JTEKT and Toyota Boshoku have their headquarters in or near Nagoya. Mitsubishi Motors has an R&D division in the suburb of Okazaki. Major component suppliers such as Magna International and PPG also have a strong presence here. Spark plug maker NGK and Nippon Sharyo, known for manufacturing rolling stock including the Shinkansen are headquartered there.\n\n\n=== Aviation industry ===\nThe aviation history has historically been of importance since the industrialization. During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area. Robot technology is another rapidly developing industry.\nA materials engineering industry is developing.Brother Industries, which is known for office electronics such as multifunction printers is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, which is known for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment. Many small machine tool and electronics companies are also based in the area.The World Expo 2005, also known as Aichi Expo was held near Nagoya in the neighboring cities of Nagakute and Seto from March 25 to September 25, 2005.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nRetail is of importance in the city. Traditional department stores with roots in Nagoya are Matsuzakaya, Maruei and the Meitetsu Department Store. Oriental Nakamura was bought by Mitsukoshi from Tokyo in 1977.\n\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nThe Owari province was historically well known for the cloisonn\u00e9 art form. The Ando Cloisonn\u00e9 Company continues the long tradition.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Confectionery company Marukawa is well known.\nThe city offers venues for conferences and congresses such as the Nagoya Congress Center and the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nNagoya is served by Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO), built on an artificial island in Tokoname. The airport has international flights and a high volume of domestic flights.\nA second airport is Nagoya Airfield (Komaki Airport, NKM) near the city's boundary with Komaki and Kasugai. On February 17, 2005, Nagoya Airport's commercial international flights moved to Centrair Airport. Nagoya Airfield is now used for general aviation and as an airbase and is the main Fuji Dream Airlines hub.\nNagoya Station, the world's largest train station by floor area, is on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, and the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, among others. JR Central, which operates the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, has its headquarters there. Meitetsu is also based in Nagoya, and along with Kintetsu provides regional rail service to the T\u014dkai and Kansai regions. Nagoya Subway provides urban transit service.\nNagoya Port is the largest port by international trade value in Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation exports via this port.\nNagoya is known for its orderly grid street plan for which the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu is ultimately responsible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNagoya has mostly state-run primary and secondary schools. The area in the city limits includes international schools such as the Nagoya International School and Col\u00e9gio Brasil Jap\u00e3o Prof. Shinoda Brazilian school.State and private colleges and universities primarily located in the eastern area. Some Western-style institutions were founded early in the Meiji era, with more opening during the Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa eras. Nagoya University was set up in 1871 as a medical school and has produced six Nobel Prize laureates in science. Nanzan University was established by the Roman Catholic Society of the Divine Word in 1932 as a high school and expanded to include Nanzan Junior College and the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. The main campus was designed in the 1960s by the renowned architect Antonin Raymond. Some universities specialise in engineering and technology, such as Nagoya University Engineering school, Nagoya Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute; these universities receive support and grants from companies such as Toyota.\nOther colleges and universities include: Aichi Prefectural College of Nursing & Health, Aichi Shukutoku Junior College, Aichi Toho University, Chukyo University, Daido University, Doho University, Kinjo Gakuin University, Kinjo Gakuin University Junior College, Meijo University, Nagoya City University, Nagoya College of Music, Nagoya Future Culture College, Nagoya Gakuin University, Nagoya Management Junior College, Nagoya Women's University, St. Mary's College, Nagoya, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Sugiyama Jogakuen University Junior College, Tokai Gakuen Women's College.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the Shoin-zukuri architecture of the feudal era. Tokugawa Art Museum is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated national Treasures of Japan, including some of the oldest scrolls of The Tale of Genji. The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of Noh theatre. The Nagoya City Museum showcases the history of the town.\nY\u014dki-s\u014d is a villa and gardens located in Chikusa-ku, close to Nittai-ji. It was constructed in the Taish\u014d era for Ito Jirozaemon Suketami XV, the first president of Matsuzakaya.\nPaintings and sculpture are exhibited at the Nagoya City Art Museum. Modern art is displayed at the Aichi Arts Center. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts, a sister museum to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.\nThe art of porcelain and ceramics can be seen at the Noritake Garden. Toyota has two museums in the city, the Toyota Automobile Museum which shows vintage cars, and the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology, which showcases company history, including its start as a textile mill.\nThe Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum has trams and subway cars, as well as the Nagoya City Science Museum. The SCMaglev and Railway Park opened in March 2011 with various trains from the Central Japan Railway Company.\nOther art museums in Aichi prefecture are the Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum and the Toyota Municipal Museum of Art. Meiji Mura is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Showa eras. Another museum in Nagoya is the Mandolin Melodies Museum.\nOther museums in the city include the International Design Centre Nagoya, the Japan Spinning Top Museum and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum.\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"Cultural Path\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nNoh theatre and Ky\u014dgen date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The Nagoya Noh Theater at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's kabuki grand stages is Misono-za, which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\nIn 1912, the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the Nagoya harp music instrument.\nIn 1992, the large, modern Aichi Arts Center was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for performing arts, featuring a main hall that can be used for opera and theatre and a concert hall. The Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national festivals and holidays, other festivals in Nagoya are unique to the city/region.\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri (\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d, Street Performer's Festival) in \u014csu.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe Nagoya dialect (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01, Nagoya-ben) is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi). Dishes include: \n\nTebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori\nTenmusu: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp\nKishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.\nRed miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce and miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup)\nHitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as unadon, with spice and as chazuke.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe world premier of the first Godzilla movie was in Nagoya on October 27, 1954. The city, especially Nagoya Castle, has been featured in three other Godzilla movies: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, and Godzilla vs. Mothra. The city is also featured in Gamera vs. Gyaos and is the main setting of 2003 film Gozu. The 1995 film The Hunted starring Christopher Lambert and the 1992 film Mr. Baseball starring Tom Selleck were also filmed in the city.\nThe city was the setting for the 2007 movie Ashita e no yuigon (translated as Best Wishes for Tomorrow), in which a Japanese war criminal sets out to take responsibility for the execution of U.S. airmen. The anime The Wind Rises by Hayao Miyazaki, released in 2013, is a highly fictionalized biography of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero's chief engineer Jiro Horikoshi and takes mostly place in Nagoya of the 1920s and 1930s. Nagoya is also the setting for the manga and anime series Yatogame-chan Kansatsu Nikki, which highlights many of the sites and traditions of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nNagoya is home to several professional sports teams:\n\nIn 2007, the Chunichi Dragons won the Japan Series baseball championship. In 2010, Nagoya Grampus won the J. League championship, their first in team history. Nagoya is also the home of the Nagoya Barbarians semi-pro rugby football club.\nA honbasho sumo tournament is held every July at the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium. The city has hosted The Crowns golf tournament since 1960 and the women's Nagoya Marathon since 1984.\nIn September 2016 the city was awarded the right to host the 2026 Asian Games after it was the only city to lodge a bid. It will be the third time Japan hosts the event after Tokyo in 1958 and Hiroshima in 1994.The city hosted the official 1979 Asian Basketball Championship. Later, it became one of the host cities of the official Women's Volleyball World Championship for its 1998, 2006 and 2010 editions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nThe Nagoya International Center promotes international exchange in the local community. It houses the U.S. Consulate on the 6th floor and the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) on the 7th floor.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nNagoya is twinned with five cities around the world:\n Los Angeles, United States (affiliated April 1, 1959)\n Mexico City, Mexico (affiliated February 16, 1978)\n Sydney, Australia (affiliated September 16, 1980)\n Turin, Italy (affiliated May 27, 2005)\n Reims, France (affiliated October 20, 2017) The sister city relationship with Nanjing in China was suspended in February 21, 2012, following public comments by Nagoya mayor Takashi Kawamura denying the Nanking Massacre.\n\n\n=== Partner cities ===\n Taichung, Taiwan (affiliated October 25, 2019)\n Tashkent, Uzbekistan (affiliated December 18, 2019)\n\n\n=== Sister ports ===\nNagoya's sister ports are:\n\n Los Angeles, United States (1959)\n Fremantle, Australia (1983)\n Baltimore, United States (1985)\n Antwerp, Belgium (1988)\n Shanghai, China (2003)\n Sydney, Australia (2010)\n Bruges, Belgium (2013)\n\n\n=== Sister Airport ===\nNagoya's sister Airport is:\n\n Grant County International Airport, United States (2016)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sightseeing ==\n\nNagoya's two most famous sightseeing spots are Atsuta Shrine and Nagoya Castle.\nAtsuta Shrine is the second-most venerable shrine in Japan, after Ise Grand Shrine.

          "A very good enclosed shopping precinct , look out for Alice in wonderland shop with its small door Down? ?",
          "This shopping street is a bit different from other shopping streets. It seems to have a lot of foreign restaurants mixed with local shops. Popular amongst youth. So if you want a kebab from turkey or some Brazilian bbq, this is the place to go. You also get to go to the temple.",
          "It's a bunch of covered galleries and there are a lot of things to eat and to see. It's good to see the temple and the shops, especially in rainy days.",
          "Comparing shopping streets in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, the one here in Nagoya was a bit silent, less variety, less shops, and less crowded too. Also with far less food shops, cafe and convenience stores, and made it a little dry and boring.",
          "Plenty of interesting shops to discover. From antiques till electronics and clothes but no high fashion thus budget friendly. Also many eateries around.",
          "Apart from shopping centers, department stores from Sakae, it is the place for budget travelers, you can find restaurants with reasonable prices, food stalls, 100yen shops, supermarket selling cheap food and fresh sushi, we enjoyed it very much! I wish i can spend more times",
          "The Osu shopping street is a busy street with lots of small stores and streetfood. Check also the antique flea market at the other end of the street, in front of Osu Temple and Komehyo brand flea market.",
          "This is the must go place shopping for local food. There are a lot of shops. You can spend hours there.",
          "This is an authentic shopping experience with great food; amazing market like stores and an authentic experience unsullied by western culture, highly recommended!",
          "My visit here is already my third last January 2016. What I love this shopping district is the cheap price & variety of stores : Antique Shops Food Stalls Restaurants Book-Off (best 2nd hand store is Japan) Gaming Centers Anime and Manga Shops and a lot more... Your money's",
          "We read somewhere this shopping district is full of gadgets and t-shirts with horrendous English. We didn't find any gadgets or t-shirts that's worth buying. The shopping area is huge (at least 4 long streets lined with shops and restaurants). I would say it's nothing special.",
          "There is a good variety of shops, 100yen stores, eyewear, traditional japanese food and clothing shops, foreign food, drug stores. Right next to the Osukannon and its all indoors just occasional crossroads that is not covered, so its good even for a rainy day! There's also a",
          "After having seen the shopping street in Osaka's Dontonburi; Kyoto's Nishiki Market, Ueno's Ameyoko, Nagoya's Osu shopping Street pales compared with its bigger brothers. It does has a rare gem, that is the squid ball. Unlike the the Osaka or elsewhere that I had tried, this",
          "At night time this place is great for wandering and exploring. Because Nagoya is well off the beaten track tourist wise, exploring the city at night immerses you in Japanese culture perfectly.",
          "I have been to the market many times, and love walking through all of the electronic shops! I have one favorite store which is Watchman!! Multi-level shop with jewelry on first floor, watches on one floor, and designer handbags on the next. I have bought Omega watches from this",
          "We only found the location when a nice and kind couple helped us with the direction and walked us all the way there. We were there in the early evening and most shops were preparing for closure but I'm sure there may be more things to see and buy during the day. We went to a",
          "We went there quite late. Around 6.30 - 7.00pm and some of the stores already closed and some prepared to close. It was a large covered shopping street with some affordable clothing and stuffs. It was a rainy day, we basically wanted to take a shade so it may be a good walk if",
          "Easily accessible. Not too crowded, and lots of things to peruse. Full of Japanese'y' things to see and buy.",
          "A lot of stores, a lot of choices. Good shopping place! Just find a nice thing even if not so cheap but worthwhile . Here I got an old camera for display but is actually a sharpener - just good for my coloring pencil hobby!",
          "A short subway ride away from Nagoya station is this mid to down market eclectic shopping area. Lots is unusual clothes to see and many kawaii girls walking around.",
          "It's a great market area and if you go on the weekend early they have a trash/ treasure market in front of the temple. In the shopping area the more you rummage around the more interesting things you can find there. It's also got a section for old consoles and games",
          "We popped by after the Science Museum, made our round and bought some really good Japanese green tea - roasted and original. Other than that, this is like many of the other covered malls in the other cities. Good for those with time to spare and enjoy a walk-around.",
          "Osu is a typical Japanese commercial street with cheap goods and used clothes. Around you can find interesting alternative shops and electronic, comics, kimono used and news. To eat, pizzeria Cesari offers a tasty, real Italian napolitan pizza at cheap price.",
          "There are a lot of shops but nothing super special about the place. If you have a lot of time to roam around, this is probably a place to spend the day.",
          "Very suitable for Muslim traveller. Easy to find Halal Food & Halal store here. happening surroundings. very nice place. visit here is a must.",
          "Kind of put off by the vendors. If you stop for a second to look at something, they pounce on you. Most of the stuff is inexpensive and touristy.",
          "We dropped by this popular sightseeing destination twice here during our Nagoya stay. The Osu Shopping District has existed for many years as the commercial streets serving the nearby locals and its Buddhist temples and Shinto Shrines. Some of the businesses here have very rich",
          "Love walking around here, there's something to interest everyone. From the temple at the start, the great shops, the street vendors and the people playing oriental instruments on the streets (if your lucky enough to catch them here). It's great. I was astounded and a little",
          "similar to other shopping streets in Japan, have 100 yen shops and others love the figures shop, you can buy gachapon charactors without risk to get random ones you did not want",
          "Well we actually spent more than a few hours here. Plenty of shops and food stalls and restaurants. Big department stores and second hand shops abound all along the shopping district. Make a quick stop at the Osu Kannon Temple and check out the smaller shrines around the area.",
          "Every Time I visit Nagoya I always visit this place. This place has a calm feel and some lovely local shops. Also nice temple which is a must as you enter Osu. From clothes to electronics to games you can find everything and people are very nice and helpful. If you are",
          "Lots of Japanese stype food shops and souvenier but also modern clothing and shops. Good for shopping, can easily spend about 2 hours browsing ! There are some Kimonos shops which you can buy for souveniers too !",
          "I was looking forward to visiting this place as I collect ceramic plates with Koi design. I was disappointed as the place did not sell good quality items. Most are second hand but mostly junk. There are no restroom or toilet in the area. Food or restaurant choices are also",
          "Went during the weekday and during lunch time. It was pretty quiet. I liked it because I am one of those people who don't like too like too much crowd. The second hand kimono shops were wonderful. Wanted to buy but didn't know how to wear one.",
          "This area has heaps of strange and interesting shops. Some arcades and lots of food shops. The best food I ate was fried chicken from Lee's Kitchen . I went on a Wednesday so a few shops closed. The temple close by is beautiful and worth a look. There are many hidden shops so",
          "Visiting Osu is one of our family holiday routine in Nagoya city in Japan when we go back to visit my family. Osu has large temple in the main entrance and you should start from here when you come to Osu before looking around the shops. If you are looking for some Japanese",
          "It was just very few people there on weekdays. I suggest go in weekends or holidays. The stores there mostly second hand shops and there were also many food stalls available for snacks! My only interest is the 100yen shop! Excellent in variety and quality for most products!",
          "It's my first time in Nagoya, so some local friends took me to Osu. It's a pretty cool little shopping district with a bunch of shops, food, etc. that's fun to browse and wander around",
          "Take around Osu temple, a lot of shop_food shop, clothes shop, second use shop,coffee shop...etc. I enjoyed street around 3 hours. Nice local place.",
          "Very cute little items you can get from the 100 yen shop and the 300 yen shop. There is also a shop with the theme of Alice in the Wonderland. You have to bend down to get inside the little entrance. Come for a visit even if you are not fond of shopping.",
          "I came here with some friends who took me around to see the sights and the food as well as the temple at the end of the street. It seems like most stuff you need you can get here from food to clothes, shoes and all manner of things. A good few hours were spent here-very busy",
          "1 long street dedicated to shopping of food, clothes and some other stuff. I really enjoyed it here! Dedicate easily 2-3 hours to this place. Next to it there's a nice small temple. Important! Come before 18:00 as around 18:30 a lot of the shops close and it starts to empty!",
          "There are many cute shops there, and since it's under a roof, it's a perfect way to spend time if it's raining. There are maps everywhere, and they are colour-marked so you don't need to be able to read Japanese or anything, just check which colour is on top of the map and then",
          "I was looking forward to this shopping venue. As a tourist, I was looking for some souvenirs to take home to remember the trip. However, I was sadly disappointed in the fare for sale. This was more like an open air flea market than a tourist destination. The items on sale",
          "Osu is a sub-cultural place. Its a hipster-trendy place where people dress differently, act differently and congregate with other hipsters. That is to summarize the Japanese locals here. For the non-Japanese, its a typical tourist trap; tacky Japanese gift shops dotting the",
          "be careful as most of the stores are about the same and seem to just sell a lot of made in china style junk. The prices are a little high for the style of shopping there and the whole area doesn't have a very clean feeling to it.",
          "Great time looking for second-hand brand name items. Various items on offer with good conditions and appealing price. The shops around the area offer variety of products. Ice cream was great too.",
          "I'm lucky to join summer festival at Osu when visiting on 2 Aug. There has singing and dancing performance from afternoon to night. You can dance with them to enjoy happy moment.",
          "I liked shops, colours and people. I spent many hours there. Also the restaurants in this are are very good.",
          "When I make a plan to visit Osu, I didn't know that even a one you can not finish to see all the shops around Osu. It's one of the biggest Shopping Street I ever visit, everything you want you can find there from Electronics equipment, Clothes, Kids games etc and after you can",
          "Nice place to spend a couple of hours. Mostly clothing stores and restaurants. You won't find much on the souvenir side but that's because Osu is not made for tourists. Has a very Japanese feel to it and nice selection of clothes, both new and used.",
          "This is my 3rd visit to the Osu shopping street and as always it is a great way to shop with the locals, there is a great variety od goods for sale and many restaurants and cafes to tempt your taste buds. you will find kimono both new and old along with some out there clothing",
          "Great shops food and Atmosphere. This is the Litmus test for Foreigners. If they don't like Osu, they are not compatible with Japan. Old world Japanese charm.",
          "Osu shopping street is an outdoor, covered shopping area. Our friends in Nagoya thought we would enjoy a visit here, and they were right. We entered via the Osu Kannon Buddhist temple that sits just outside the entrance to the shopping street. The temple is quite spectacular.",
          "Adjacent to Osu Kannon Temple. It's a thrift shop in Nagoya but some are not really that cheap. They have 2nd hand goods also or resale of high end brands. There are restaurants and street foods as well.",
          "Large array of interesting little shops in three arcade lanes. Only criticism...... Very hot and very few places to sit and rest. Virtually impossible to buy plain bottled water anywhere. Only refreshments all over Nagoya are from vending machines, very few of which have",
          "Osu Shopping Street is a shopping district encompassing two covered main streets and cross streets. The covered streets run from Osu Kannon Temple in the west to Otsu Dori street in the east. The longest covered street is about .5 kilometers. The Osu area is a thrift store",
          "We loved this shopping area, plenty of unique goods to buy. I really recommend to try the Japanese Cherry Blossom icecream., it was amazing, so refreshing and delicious.",
          "Very affordable shopping area, great for children to buy toys and souvenirs without putting in dent in your wallet. There is a little bit of everything here. We had a great day walking around and looking for deals.",
          "This place you can not compare with shopping in Osaka because of very different quality. Osu is targeting for lower quality and price level. In general good place to find something bargain, cheap and maybe something special. Go there if you know what for. Recommended",
          "Use Meijo line or Tsurumai line stop at Kamimaezu station Exit 8, turn right a bit you'll meet the Shopping street walk flow the shopping street at the end you will meet Osu Kannon temple another sightseeing spot, and you can use Osu Kannon station to ride to another place. Good",
          "After reading some of the other reviews here, apparently there is a parade, but we didn't get to see that. the Osu Shopping street is a big blend of shops, from small snack stores selling mochi, takoyaki, fried chicken etc to medium shops selling clothes to big 100 yen shops and",
          "Absolutely loved this place. Like a lot of street shopping in Japan, it's got an eclectic mix of the trendy, modern and completely whack. I came back with a pair of Tees on a bargain. Also, love the food here and like most Japanese street shops the collection of vintage clothing.",
          "We were lucky enough to be here for the parade of oiran and their retinue through this street. Amazing number of people jammed in to see this. The shops are fabulous - a wide variety - everything from live goldfish to second hand kimono! A must see if you're staying in Nagoya.",
          "food trip galore! starting off with brazilian chicken, fried chicken and tacos! after eating shopping time! you can find anything and everything here. they even have a supermarket that has low low prices :) love the duty free shops too! they even have staff who can speak",
          "Osu is a shopping destination in Nagoya. There is a good variety of shops, offering new and vintage items. Some shops with vintage clothing have items worthy of some museums, Friendly Nagoyo salesperson made me love this street very much. I even found a very interesting second",
          "In this place ,there are many things ,many shops and many people. Comfortable toilets but the carparkings so expensive.",
          "Osu is an integrated trade area with one of the famous temples in Achi Perfecture . One of the religious tourist destination for the Buddhist religion or lover clasic architecture . Travelers can also directly souvenir shopping in this area .",
          "It is not so crowded like some famous shopping area in Osaka or Tokyo, but it has plenty of shops, restaurants to choose from. The famous food here is fried chicken cutlet (can be seen every way). We also noticed that most goods here are cheaper than those in Osaka & Tokyo. The",
          "It was interesting to see recycled clothes and other goods being sold in large stores. One could even buy used clothes according to weight - 1,2,3,4 yen per gram.",
          "if you want something typical japanese, then this might not be your perfect destination. But if you have some time to kill and you are up for some shopping, then this is an interesting place to visit. Make sure to get some Turkish ice cream if you've never had some!",
          "If you are interested in buying a real kimono at a reasonable cost than visit this area. I got a beautiful kimono for about $50 and an obi with a bow already tied. Lots of shops with many different things. Shoppers heaven.",
          "even if this is a shopping stree, it's not as crowded as in Dotonburi. Don't miss Seria 100 yes shop and the fish-shaped croissant-taiyaki red bean.",
          "Road for shopping The two sides went all the way to the store to make shopping at any shop. (Warning), you could take a very long time.",
          "As long as you have money, you can't go wrong with this place. Food, clothes, gadgets and novelty items! Lot and lots of varieties!",
          "Not really tourist attraction. More to local street market. I can say lack of products and people coming to this area. The products are a bit pricey.",
          "Osu continues to be my favorite shopping destination in Nagoya. There is a good variety of shops, offering new and vintage items. Some shops with vintage clothing have items worthy of some museums, in my opinion! It is good to check ahead of time to see if a shop is open, as",
          "Found some 2nd Hand shops, and trendy stores. Feel and visit EVISU store. Some good restaurants to each but end up need reservation. Had Lunch at Tokyo Restaurant good steak burger and good service. Get better local feeling on the weekend. Hard to find public toilet. But over",
          "We went here on two occasions - once in the morning and once in the late afternoon.It is a hodge podge of stores and restaurants, There are several used clothing stores but no bargains. Better to go to the underground shopping at Nagoya Station or Central Park at Sakee",
          "The streets are as usual, filled with shops selling local clothes and cheap shoes, lots of eateries for Japanese as well as western restaurants. Once a while, you'll come across unique shops selling environmental friendly jewelries, vintage clothing. We also enjoyed fresh made",
          "Our friends took my husband and I through this bustling area with tons of shops and restaurants. We were delighted to discover a taiyaki shop on a corner; these are delicious Japanese pastries filled with red beans or custard. There was quite a line, but it moved quickly and",
          "Multiple shops although be careful about items purchased as not all of them sell Japanese products. Easily accesible via subway and bus",
          "Friendly Nagoyo salesperson made me love this street very much. I even found a very interesting second hand branded shop there. You can find 2000 yen made in Japan shoes in this street!",
          "Liked: A street with roof, lots to buy and see, no worries to shop during rainy days. dislike: They sell stuff from China as well, so if you are looking for authentic Japanese made, make sure you ask the owner before you buy...",
          "Honestly, I for one can hang around here all day. I love how it's all decorated in a very Japanese style, with flags and lampions and gates, not to mention the massive temple of Osukannon at the beginning. With that and the kimono-, yukata-, gothic lolita-, and omiyage shops,",
          "We spent a full day just wandering up and down the streets. There are tons of places to shop from used to new and a great place to pick up souvenirs. There is plenty of food choices as well so be brave and try something new. dont forget to stop by the temple Osu Kannon while you",
          "This is a great shopping area with loads on offer. Plenty of bargains to be had. Nice to have the overhead covering as it was raining. Should not be missed",
          "This place lacks charm, and is not worth visiting. The merchandise on sale is mostly from outside Japan",
          "It reminds me of Dongdameon in Seoul as its quite similar with many streets to roam around but easily got lost too.",
          "its nice to stroll around here after visiting the osu kannon temple, but not much things to see in here. but from here you can walk further to the shopping street in nagoya where they have all the major shopping centre .",
          "This shopping street offers a lot of things from fashion to food. Bought snacks for omiyage with cheap price. Visited this place twice on September 2014 and March 2015.",
          "Lovely area for an amble. And finding great places to eat. Lots of small shops. Plenty to see. 100yen, 200yen and 300yen shops!",
          "Aside from Sakae, this place is the place to shop in Nagoya. Besides Komehyo, there are loads of shops from food to apparel, all at great prices.",
          "I prefer this kind of authentic Japanese shopping street to those modern shopping streets like Ginza in Tokyo. Well, I can't afford those in Ginza anyway, but enjoy poking around the Osu without really buying anything. :-D And the authentic Japanese cuisine is to die for.",
          "Close to OSU Kannon (Guanyin) Temple, this is a more \u201cpedestrian\u201d version of Sakae. Compared to the latter\u2019s high end malls, this is a neighbourhood of several streets full of shops, restaurants and food stalls- highly recommended for tourists who want to try local cuisine &",
          "good for food hunting. but for shopping, it's more for locals. worth for a visit by the way. accessible by MRT.",
          "Very interesting shopping street, accessible from the grounds of Osu Kannon temple. This is a good place for foreigners to get souvenirs, and a place where you can see a little smattering of everything. From knives to kimonos to electronics, you can find it all. Covered so",
          "Great place to get a bargain and get a very nice lunch or dinner, many electronics shops and there is a temple joined to the shopping area, Osu kanon, great place for taking pictures.",
          "Possibly the most interesting area in Nagoya to experience local culture. There are different elements coexisting in the area both with hip and tradition. Regardless the weather, one can enjoy under arcade covering main streets.",
          "A great place to spend a day at with many small shops selling the usual stuff for tourists. Some are 2nd hand places. many also small restaurants and should go for noodles and Japanese foods while you are there. A few shopping centres and a cinema is within the area. Great fun",
          "There is an Alice store here, where you enter through a small door to access a quaint retail shop, lines are long. Then there is komehyo second hand stores all around. Though the shopping street is nt as long as that of Nishiki Market in Kyoto or the Shinsaibashi of Osaka,",
          "Maybe cos we have been to the shopping streets in Osaka and Kyoto so Osu feels a little less interesting. We didn't get a chance to see the flea market though. Nevertheless, this is a decent place to head to after visiting the Kannon temple.",
          "There is a small little shrine tucked in a lane and it isn't crowded so if you like photography, you'll find this interesting. There is a 100 yen shop here called Seria. And lastly, there is a lot of food here, but this might be because we visited on Hatsumode, the first day of",
          "A good street shopping with many choices of food and gifts shipping opportunity. Very near to Kanon Buddhist temple.",
          "This is my favorite shopping area in Nagoya! It might not have all the latest and coolest brands, but I just love the atmosphere. It's a fun place to go for a stroll in the afternoon.",
          "it has a few shrines worth to see and a shopping street of low budget needs, some stuffs were very worth the $",
          "Osu was a great experience! I really liked it much better then some of the shopping malls I visited in and near Nagoya. I found unique souvenirs to bring home and the environment was one of a kind and interesting. I loved the Osu shooing street!",
          "Great for shoppers, from wares to Japanese foodstuff. Price reasonable. Top attraction is the Nagoya Osu Kannon temple located at one end of the street.",
          "Absolutely loved this place! A giant mecca of all things thrifted, new, delicious and random! Scored some amazing brand name clothing (in excellent condition) at a fraction of recommended prices! Excellent spot for gift/souvenir shopping too, prices are super reasonable. Make",
          "The shopping street are big and it has quite a lot that you can buy. Some of the shops are even having flat price through out the shop for all the items which make it so worthy to get something that you wanted. Some of the food that are famous such as Number 1 Napoleon Pizza,",
          "Very disappointed with the goods being sold except perhaps the Japanese food store! Seems like the clothes are 2nd hand and used clothes.",
          "Known for luxury name brands at great bargains, this is where thrift meets extravagance. Want an expensive dress watch at half the price and don't mind that it was pre-owned, try Komehyo! You wouldn't even be able to tell the difference if it's brand new or pre-loved.",
          "More than three quarters of the shops are for eating and it is definitely a good shopping oaradise for young people. At least spare 2 or 3 hours for shopping as it is always crowded with people.",
          "Lots of local food to try, lots of locals, your typical Japanese shotengai. One day isn't enough to explore it. Osu Temple nearby as well.",
          "If you come to Nagoya, this shopping street is worth visit. They offer variety of food (not really traditional Japanese food, but huge selection of ethnic foods), interesting fashion boutiques, cosmetics, art crafts, and so many electronics gadgets such as computer parts, audio",
          "Me and my husband went 3 times here in OSU, I love all the signature bags and jewelleries because is cheaper than the actual boutique or shops around Sakae or even in the actual shop. Eg. Gucci,LV,etc.",
          "Nothing much to offer at the shopping street. in fact I should say boring. The temple is quite unique though. Pigeons flying around, for those who are sensitive to birds dropping better avoid this place.",
          "Went there for the monthly flea market. The temple is so so but I enjoyed the flea market even though I didn't find Anthing to buy. Didn't visit the retails as it was too early.",
          "A good mix of higher end to mass market goods being sold. Most major brands including local major brands can be found at Osu Shopping District. It is also very easy to navigate around and is near the train stations, unlike Tokyo. It is more pleasant to do shopping here though.",
          "Pay a visit to Osu Kannon Temple before you head to the retail therapy area. It's a huge place for shopping of clothes, shoes, novelty items, pre-loved branded items & jewelries in Komehyo. Must try karaage (chicken) which is one of Nagoya's popular food. Enjoyed the 100yen",
          "I went by here after visiting the Osu Kannon temple. Didnt expect much but this is just a really old flea market. There may be a few food stalls which may be of some interest but otherwise I think this can be skipped. Dont expect to find cute antiques or other interesting",
          "This more like a flea market kind of street. Nothing much really as the items offer here are at mediocre at their best. Some street food but nothing to shout about.",
          "Took half an hour to get there by train and temple was nothing special and the mall/streets of shops did not hit my chords at all. Full of stuff nobody wants to buy I reckon. It was 6 or 7 pm and seems like the whole thing closes down around that hour. Maybe it's more",
          "Osu is a really nice shopping district with a lot of variety. I went about every other weekend while I was living in Nagoya, and it never disappointed. The street food was absolutely great, too, and there were just so many places to choose from.",
          "not many tourists here, i wonder why..rain or shine, the street is covered! fantastic place to immerse in Japanese culture and fashion. lots of place to eat..2nd hand stores galore!",
          "I believe that 20 years ago this was a premier shopping district but today it has faded from its glory. Not many brand name shops. I could pick out the other tourists looking for the same things that we were..they too were disappointed. For shopping try the Sakae area with lots",
          "Great and large shopping area. Pretty much everything you need (or not) is there. Plenty of restaurants so you get you daily meals there too. Place is easy located in Nagoya, you can walk there from Nagoya station or from Kanayama station.",
          "Great place and very chill out street with many shops there. Komehyo was where a buy a vintage camera which was a great bargain. Record shops are many though they are not cheap. I think really it is much worth than going then Sakai. Most tourists would first visit the Ozu",
          "Huge number of small shops and restaurants. Takes several hours to walk through and watch. Try to taste the original Japanese food (as take-aways) - you will love it.",
          "Forget Sakae, chill out down Osu way, and go to the Komehyo shops. This area has so much to offer, and a great little shrine",

        "wiki": "Nagoya (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02, Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region of Japan. It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters.

During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area. Robot technology is another rapidly developing industry.\nA materials engineering industry is developing.Brother Industries, which is known for office electronics such as multifunction printers is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, which is known for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment.

On February 17, 2005, Nagoya Airport's commercial international flights moved to Centrair Airport. Nagoya Airfield is now used for general aviation and as an airbase and is the main Fuji Dream Airlines hub.\nNagoya Station, the world's largest train station by floor area, is on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, and the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, among others. JR Central, which operates the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, has its headquarters there. Meitetsu is also based in Nagoya, and along with Kintetsu provides regional rail service to the T\u014dkai and Kansai regions. Nagoya Subway provides urban transit service.\nNagoya Port is the largest port by international trade value in Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation exports via this port.\nNagoya is known for its orderly grid street plan for which the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu is ultimately responsible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNagoya has mostly state-run primary and secondary schools.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the Shoin-zukuri architecture of the feudal era.

Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"Cultural Path\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nNoh theatre and Ky\u014dgen date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The Nagoya Noh Theater at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's kabuki grand stages is Misono-za, which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\nIn 1912, the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the Nagoya harp music instrument.\nIn 1992, the large, modern Aichi Arts Center was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for performing arts, featuring a main hall that can be used for opera and theatre and a concert hall. The Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national festivals and holidays, other festivals in Nagoya are unique to the city/region.\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri (\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d, Street Performer's Festival) in \u014csu.\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe Nagoya dialect (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01, Nagoya-ben) is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi). Dishes include: \n\nTebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori\nTenmusu: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp\nKishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.\nRed miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce and miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup)\nHitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as unadon, with spice and as chazuke.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe world premier of the first Godzilla movie was in Nagoya on October 27, 1954. The city, especially Nagoya Castle, has been featured in three other Godzilla movies: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, and Godzilla vs. Mothra. The city is also featured in Gamera vs. Gyaos and is the main setting of 2003 film Gozu. The 1995 film The Hunted starring Christopher Lambert and the 1992 film Mr. Baseball starring Tom Selleck were also filmed in the city.\nThe city was the setting for the 2007 movie Ashita e no yuigon (translated as Best Wishes for Tomorrow), in which a Japanese war criminal sets out to take responsibility for the execution of U.S. airmen. The anime The Wind Rises by Hayao Miyazaki, released in 2013, is a highly fictionalized biography of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero's chief engineer Jiro Horikoshi and takes mostly place in Nagoya of the 1920s and 1930s. Nagoya is also the setting for the manga and anime series Yatogame-chan Kansatsu Nikki, which highlights many of the sites and traditions of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nNagoya is home to several professional sports teams:\n\nIn 2007, the Chunichi Dragons won the Japan Series baseball championship. In 2010, Nagoya Grampus won the J. League championship, their first in team history.

The city has hosted The Crowns golf tournament since 1960 and the women's Nagoya Marathon since 1984.\nIn September 2016 the city was awarded the right to host the 2026 Asian Games after it was the only city to lodge a bid. It will be the third time Japan hosts the event after Tokyo in 1958 and Hiroshima in 1994.The city hosted the official 1979 Asian Basketball Championship. Later, it became one of the host cities of the official Women's Volleyball World Championship for its 1998, 2006 and 2010 editions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nThe Nagoya International Center promotes international exchange in the local community. It houses the U.S. Consulate on the 6th floor and the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) on the 7th floor.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nNagoya is twinned with five cities around the world:\n Los Angeles, United States (affiliated April 1, 1959)\n Mexico City, Mexico (affiliated February 16, 1978)\n Sydney, Australia (affiliated September 16, 1980)\n Turin, Italy (affiliated May 27, 2005)\n Reims, France (affiliated October 20, 2017) The sister city relationship with Nanjing in China was suspended in February 21, 2012, following public comments by Nagoya mayor Takashi Kawamura denying the Nanking Massacre.\n\n\n=== Partner cities ===\n Taichung, Taiwan (affiliated October 25, 2019)\n Tashkent, Uzbekistan (affiliated December 18, 2019)\n\n\n=== Sister ports ===\nNagoya's sister ports are:\n\n Los Angeles, United States (1959)\n Fremantle, Australia (1983)\n Baltimore, United States (1985)\n Antwerp, Belgium (1988)\n Shanghai, China (2003)\n Sydney, Australia (2010)\n Bruges, Belgium (2013)\n\n\n=== Sister Airport ===\nNagoya's sister Airport is:\n\n Grant County International Airport, United States (2016)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sightseeing ==\n\nNagoya's two most famous sightseeing spots are Atsuta Shrine and Nagoya Castle.\nAtsuta Shrine is the second-most venerable shrine in Japan, after Ise Grand Shrine.

          "The museum is absolutely amazing and I had so much fun there. It's like a gigantic 6 floors of playground for both children and adults. Try to pick a good time to avoid the numerous school trips, I believe it can get pretty crowded. The only downside is the lack of English",
          "Even the majority explanations are in Japanese, but the experiential part on each floor made it fun to visit. I like the ice lab where we can experience the cool of the south pole.",
          "A very good museum with plenty of interactive displays, a worthwhile visit if in the area.With in walking distance from train",
          "It was a great place to visit. It is very interesting, however there isn't really any English signs so it was hard to know what the things are. I thought 1 hour and 10 minutes enough to look around the whole museum (It was near closing time). NOPE, that wasn't enough time",
          "No english informations even on the google map. The map says open from 9:30 but all day was closed and no informations about that! No english. We waste our time!",
          "It's like a science and social sciences Disney world. However, the planetarium is in Japanese. You can spend a good few hours there. Price is reasonable.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Nagoya City Science Museum. There were so many interesting exhibits, lots of them hands-on. It's really a great way for people to appreciate science in everyday life. I just wish there was more English signs/labels around.",
          "There are a wide range of exhibits and many interesting experimental tools. Wish they can have more English descriptions or maybe English tour guide or guidebook to understand more.",
          "The first thing that gets your attention when going to the Nagoya City Science Museum is the unique architecture of the building. A giant sphere structure that is great to take photos of from the end of the street. We bought tickets to the planetarium (largest in Japan) but",
          "planetarium show is only available in Japanese but very worth a visit. Its very good place for kids. Theres a-lot of hands on exhibit and fun place if you like science.",
          "Kids will be so much enjoyable visiting this place, it offers lots of science knowledge for kids and adults like us. I went there with my 15 years old son, he just walked here and there non-stop till I and my wife had to tell him that he goes take a look by himself, we are so",
          "This museum was very interesting. I visited it with my wife and children. And the museum has many things for all ages. Another interesting thing was their way to show the science by simulation and real experience. What made me boring only the planetarium that show only the story",
          "The science Museum has plenty of interactive exhibits you can learn from. Most are in Japanese but it was still enjoyable to play with them. It is suitable for people of all ages. Only 400 jpy for general entry and an extra 400 for the planetarium. Great value for money and a",
          "We had a blast here and it felt like there was a lot to do. Try to catch the wind demonstration. It is geared towards the whole family but young kids would enjoy it too. The robotic t-Rex was my sons favorite, but he opted out of the \u201cice\u201d room because it made him nervous and it",
          "This museum is better than our expectations. We thought that all the exhibition would be written in Japanese and we wouldn't understand. However, some of the exhibits were self-explanatory. As a matter of fact, the space movie we didn't go. But we spent a lot of time in the",
          "You could spend hours exploring this museum and planetarium. The displays are mostly hands on, interactive and totally engaging. It is hard to go past this as a great way to explore all things scientific first hand.",
          "Great place to play with all the experimental exhibition. This place made me kid again! hahaha. Getting mesmerized on the colorful man-made tornado, some smoke making mechanism to Dinosaur skeleton to some fossil and not forgetting the planetarium! (its in Japanese but its",
          "Very cheap museum with a lot to look at. We only had about 2 hours to spend at the museum, which was not enough to see everything. Great for kids, we were all adults in our group. A bit crowded, perhaps because we went on a sunday. All in all, very good value for 400 yen.",
          "Good opportunity to learn very basic science. Briefing in English at planetarium is needed to foreigner.",
          "We spent a fantastic rainy afternoon at the Nagoya City Science Museum. It's an amazing interactive space with many levels of hands-on learning activities. Even though it was all in Japanese, there were assistants on hand to show us how to use the different displays. My husband,",
          "Though it may seem like a geeky place, it offers one of the best planetariums i have ever visited. Also there a plenty of cool things to experience like giant tesla cage, -35C room, typhoon,. . Do book your slots for things mentioned before.",
          "A basic english audio is provided by the brother audio app. It gives a very basic explanation that is not enough to truly grasp most aspects of the museum unfortunatly. If you have been to science museums before and you are an adult who doesn\u2019t speak japanese only the",

          "Nagoya City Science museum is an amazing place for its modern building, for it's planetary inside the sphere, for it's rocket launcher and satellite replicas and its exposition. My frustration on visit it came for the lack of English explanations that limits any foreigner coming",
          "A very good science museum with planetarium. Adult ticket is JPY400 for museum entry. Planetarium is an extra JPY400. Has about 7 floors. Each floor has a different theme such as the universe, the human body, et al. Lots of parents with their kids. Lots of exhibits to touch, see",
          "Good museum for kids with decent entrance fee. Need to pay more for planetarium (only in Japanese) on the 6th floor. It has metal, water, soil, human body, day to day appliances exhibits, not to mention dinosaur replica",
          "We had a brief stop in Nagoya and headed straight for the museum. What a delight it was. Our boys, aged 7&4, loved the place. It was so interactive and even on a Saturday it wasn\u2019t too busy. They were free (high school children have to pay) and we were 400yen which we thought",
          "Museum is nice but it is designed for japanese since its mostly all descriptions are in japanese. Visited the place for the purpose of seeing age of heroes marvel. There is a separate fee for the marvel at the basement exhibit area and photos are not allowed that made my",
          "Museum entry fee is 400 JPY. If activities to be added like video show etc, ticket fee would be 1600 JPY maximum. The worst thing of museum is Language. Everything is Japanese. I look around to see English, only periodical chemist chart was english for the symbols (!). Not",
          "This is a relaxing place for you to slow down your travelling pace and rest your feet to gain a little knowledge about the general science. There are some activities for you to try whether you are young or old and they could be fun. It is not a must do thing but if you have",
          "My children pester me to visit this place and glad that we did. Very interactive activities inside but the drawback is that Japanese is the only available language. Though they have volunteers around the museum to explain but, they don't speak English! Thus there's not much",
          "enjoyed ourselves trying out the numerous interactive displays. appreciated the presentation of the periodic table very much. only setback for us was that the panels featured only Japanese explanations. that side, many of the science concepts could be grasped simply by doing the",
          "Very nice but if you can't understand Japanese it is little bit difficult. But lots of things what you can try/do yourself. Planetarium was nice but also only in Japanese.",
          "Awesome facility with a lot to see, however all descriptions and audio is in Japanese so as English speaking visitors, we left feeling as though we didn\u2019t get the whole experience. Still worth having a walk through though if you are a science fan, as entry is cheap and visuals",
          "2-3 hours at least is needed here. Even without the planetarium, the exhibitions themselves are amazing. This place will require time and would be more fun coming with another person!",
          "This is one of the most fun science museum I have ever been to. It is geared more towards teens with all those hands on exhibits but still a lot of fun for everyone. The english is lacking a bit at this museum but that doesn't matter in the science part. You can easily follow",
          "While the exhibits themselves could probably use a bit of updating, I have visited the science museum multiple times solely for its planetarium, which is the largest in the world! Their stunning blend of traditional starball technology with beautiful graphics overlays and",

          "We had 2 hours to spend before catching the Shinkansen. Nagoya City Science Museum is both interactive and informative for adults & young children with many displays to look and \u2018play\u2019 with - although mainly in Japanese it doesn\u2019t detract from the displays. Be sure if you want",

          "We went there because it was not too far from the hotel. Had fun with the interactive activities to learn more about science. The museum was full of students which is a good sight. We attended the show in the round theatre but it was in Japanese so I was sleepy sitting in the",
          "The museum hosts very basic stuff. Good only for small children to understand basic principles of physics. Special exhibit also shows basic stuff.",
          "I haven't been to a science museum since I was an 8-year-old girl. Usually, a museum isn't that interactive since most of them only showcase abstract art you think you have to try to figure out and understand where the artist is coming from. But, when it comes to science museums",
          "Good museum to spend time in with my younger children 7 and 9 years old. There are a lot of interactive displays that will keep children and adults busy for many hours. We also looked at the special exhibits. This cost extra and was not really worth it. I recommend to",
          "If you want to see a planetarium shoe get there early, schools will buy entire shows. I got there about 30 min before opening and 3 shows were sold out. The show was all in Japanese, but was still fantastic. The museum was also a lot of fun. Interactive with great staff that",
          "Very interesting museum, included a lecture or you could move around exhibits at your own pace. Aimed at children's level.",
          "I had a few hours to kill and had to decide between the Science museum and the Art museum. Personally I\u2019m more into science so I chose the first. When I entered I asked if there was anything in English available. The lady at the counter explained me that only the planetarium",
          "The place is very very well planned... very informative ... and very educational.... EXCEPT that they are ALL IN JAPANESE!! Hope they would come out with english translation even on the subtitle. The planetarium is such a WOW!!! Anyways i would still recommend theis place.",
          "There was typhoon and rain during my visit to Nagoya and I decided to have indoor activity with the kids. And we ended up spending the whole day in the museum and the kids were having so much fun. The planetarium show was in Japanese only and rather wordy than I expected it to",

          "So I went with my father since our receptionist recommended the museum. After spending 2 hours there I understand why. It is a huge 6 floor building with things to do in every single floor. We had a fun time, the only sad part being that there are no english explainations, only",
          "It was a great learning experience for me and my wife. Lots of experiments and lots of games for kids as well. And the planetarium was the icing in the cake. It was a memorable half an hour or so inside the planetarium. But during weekends it is quite difficult to get tickets on",
          "Didn't go in but I did walk there specifically to take a photo cuz it looks really cool ;) Heard it's mainly for kids; I saw preschool/elementary school students there on school trips as well.",
          "It's a nice option to visit during the weekend with kids. Very interactive, kids will love it, play, experimental...We stay in the museum like 3 hours playing. Totally recommend.",
          "Visited on a Sunday, expecting lots of locals and families visiting and there was a huge line at the door at opening. Got in line and it wasn't until an English speaking attendant asked whether we were going to the planetarium (which we weren't) and was told to head directly",
          "The entry fee for the museum is 400 yen, you pay an extra 400 yen to get a ticket for the planetarium show. There was an additional 1000 yen fee to see the special exhibitions, which we chose not to buy. The science museum was very interactive. All the displays were in",
          "Good for kids but you need to know science or Japanese because you need to explain to your kids. The tornado machine is interesting and my kid love it. Some facility is not in Hong Kong Science Museum, so we are happy to see them e.g. water facility, chemistry. The planetarium",
          "Took the kids to the science museum to hide from the rain. Glad we did! Kids had so much fun going from station to station and seeing how things work. All stations were well kept and maintained.",

          "We just bought the museum pass, even though a museum + planetarium bundle was available, because the Planetarium was only in Japanese. Even if the museum has no English explanations, it was still very wonderful to engage in the different interactive activities available, as some",
          "The kids and adult will both enjoy visiting the museum. The exhibits are well kept, and captivating. The planetarium exhibit though is in Japanense language. But overall, we would want to come back to visit this museum again",
          "I was drawn to the museum by the huge magical ball hanging between two buildings. My excitement rose when I discovered the ball is a planetarium. Unfortunately I would have to wait more than 2hr to visit the planetarium and was told the commentary was only in Japanese. What a",
          "I visited this science museum recently, I found it a very motivating and excellent combination of science and technology. Hands-on experience and feeling of real working model was one of the most attractions. Brother earth planetarium was best I have ever seen till now.",
          "It's a good place to visit. It will help if you know some Japanese. The planetarium show is good as well. Couldn't experience the Antarctica temperature as there was a long queue and the booking was full.",
          "Very nice science museum on multiple floors with cool exhibitions like recent Team Lab light show. Be sure to get there on time as they tend to be pretty strict on closing times!",
          "We had limited time and we tried to see if it was interesting. It was raining, direction to museum was not clear, we walked a long way with umbrella in the rain to the museum. There were tons of school kids waiting in line for the museum. I went in the gift shops, not much to",
          "My daughter loved this museum. There is so much to do and see. They have activities for a variety of ages and cool shows too! We bought the cheap ticket...just the museum. And we were there ALL afternoon. We left with my daughter too tired to walk. And we did not do the",
          "This was a pretty fun museum but be prepared that it is not for those who don't understand Japanese. While it would be cool for little kids to interact with the exhibits, adults who may be wanting to get something more educational out of the exhibit may have trouble",
          "We went twice - this museum is amazing! Very hands on so great for our toddler, plus my husband and I enjoyed it a lot as well! Plus it's in a beautiful park with fountains and a playground. Essential visit!!!!",
          "While in Nagoya on business we had a couple hours free and decided to visit the Science Museum. It was great, lots to see and do. Kids would love it, last went to the London Science Museum a number of years ago with my kids and decided to see what a Museum was like in a",
          "So many interesting and impressive exhibits. The planetarium is impressively big. But sad to say the show that we watched was only in Japanese so I didn't understand a thing. Watching the kids'/family show should have been better maybe. The exhibits were also all in Japanese but",
          "Lots to see at a low cost for adults and free for children. Fairly new exhibits and installations. Easy access with central location. Expect to spend >3-4 hours.",
          "Cheap entrance fee and lots to see and do. We were truly impressed with the experiment on how tornado was created. Worth the visit.",
          "This is a nice museum and very easy to get to on the subway. Take Exit 5 from the Fushimi Station of the Higashiyama (Yellow) Subway Line and walk until you see the dome of the museum down the street to your left. If you have an all day subway pass, you get a small discount.",
          "Or if only the displays had English explanations.... Such a great museum. Pity we couldn't fully appreciate it because of the language barrier. The English audio guide (through an App you need to download) was not working on the day we went. I'm not sure if it was just that day",
          "I actually enjoyed my visit although I should say that the museum its not really \"Gaijin friendly\". Do not waste money for the show inside the planetarium because it's all in Japanese without any sign of English explanation. Good to spend with kids, a lot of funny activities.",
          "This is a very well done and highly interactive museum that kids will really enjoy! The planetarium is especially good, but the shows sell out quickly so I suggest getting there in the morning rather than afternoon.",
          "Crowded with school children and young couples mesmerized by the ingenious interactive displays. Judging from the awed looks of the children, the museum is surely succeeding in getting them hooked on science.",
          "Kind of a all-in-one science museum where general science information is presented. Quite informative and interesting.",
          "Great interactive learning grounds for children and adults. Fantastic place for family to spend at least a day. Many interesting exhibits and demonstrations. However will be better if they are able to cater for international visitors.",
          "7 floor of science museum are realy good for teens and student for education. Kids are realy enjoy the place, playing while learning science. must spent 2-3 hours in here. To Bad the planetarium are only in Japanese, and not suitable for young children, children tends to ask on",
          "Arrived late in the afternoon and saw group of school children left the museum. Mornings must be filled with children. 6 floors of exhibitions of science and all. Interactive and interesting but some explanation are in Japs. Still interesting! Skip the show at planetarium,",
          "It is a shame, that such huge and modern museum doesn't provide translation of all information in English. Only English words you see are the name of sections, which doesn't help you to understand the meaning of different objects.",
          "This could be named as a good place for teens and students where they could get them selfs educated. Nice location to see around if you are a traveler.",
          "They say it's the world largest planetarium. It is impressive, the quality of the images is amazing. You just feel the Japanese quality. Museum itself is worth a visit, especially if you have kids hungry for knowledge! And, of course, the staff is very polite and helpful.",
          "The museum is easy to reach by subway, basically between two subway stations. You cannot miss this place, as in front is huge space rocket and also planetarium \"glued\" to the main building. The tickets were less than 1000yen (I forgot, but it was around 600yen for and adult, no",

          "There are a lot of things to try in the museum from 2-6 floors. It is of good value of money. Unfortunately, there is no translation on site in all items, so it is very inconvenient for foreigners. Moreover, the planetarium is in Japanese only. The foreigners can download",

          "Amazing! external appearance of landmark design featuring the spherical shape of the world's biggest planetarium. You can view the generation equipment used to power the building and the green wall. However, the museum is more suitable for junior students.",

          "This is a great museum but since we did not speak nor understand the lingo, it took the shine off the visit. The -30 degree cold-room was our highlight. As its a popular attraction, go queue earlier for limited free tickets on the same level.",
          "Even though I don't understamd Japanese, and the planetarium show was only in Japanese, I still loved it. It was massive and beautiful. And that's only a small portion of what the museum has to offer. I was gutted it is closed on Mondays, but was able to take in a small portion",
          "During my recent day trip to Nagoya, I had several hours left before my evening train back to Kyoto. So my son and I just went to this museum to \"kill our time\". It turned out a very pleasant surprise. The museum is, in typical Japanese way, meticulously organized and staged,",

          "The big-ball shaped planetarium in this Museum is brand new and may be the biggest one in Japan. Always crowded and normally you should wait in line, but worth to see.",

          "We had some time to kill before our next destination so this was our other alternative. The attraction we wanted to visit (train museum) was closed for the day. Give about 1.5 hours or 2 if you want to enter the deep freeze lab as well. Be prepared for the cold - even with warm",
          "Science has been displayed at such a fundamental level that makes you feel like a curious child again. It also houses world's biggest planetarium but sadly the explanations were in Japanese only.",
          "it was a fun time for 200 yen. wouldn't spend more than 2 hours. It was more focused towards children but as a 21yr old still fun",

          "Wanted to see the aurora film but the tickets were sold out. They dont speak english but has a website which you can access for audio translation during the tour. Gd place for family with kids. Has a cafe opp the entrance, a park and water fountain in front of the building.",
          "Everything is in Japanese. There is an English smartphone app available, but to use it you will need a smartphone for each person, WITH HEADPHONES, and plenty of battery life. We wish previous Trip Advisor reviews had mentioned this! We can't vouch for how well the app works,",
          "you will need at least 1-2hours here because there are a lot of things that you can play with, tinker with and just have fun with your kids. Don't forget to try the Deep Freeing Lab where it's -30c.",
          "Could be more interesting is they provided more english explanations every exhibits. The pass for planetarium was sold out at noon. That is quite frustrating going a long way coming here for planetarium and you won't be able to see. Still, I think we enjoyed the creativity",

          "There is very little information in English. They have many interactive exhibits and it's a great place for families. The Planetarium isn't worth the extra fee as the show is entirely in Japanese and is basically the night sky with a computer mouse pointing to different stars",

          "The museum was impressed! As we have been to many science museum in many country, this museum is one of the best. The material used is amazing . Very suitable for children below 18 to visit the staff volunteer to show us how the things work and the children learn benefited a",
          "Plenty to see, albeit mostly in Japanese. But you wouldn't need much explanation for most of the hands-on exhibits. Children will clearly love it here. Well-worth spending a couple of hours. Just be mindful that there isn't very much else in the vicinity - restaurants, shops",
          "There isn't much to do in the city of nagoya. But the museum can be a fun way to spend the day. Small distance from the Exit 5 of Fushimi Station. Provides some English translation via phone app, free wifi provided for download only. Go for the live demonstrations.",
          "Have to ignore the school parties, but well presented science at all levels. Planetarium really worth a visit. Unfortunately no English commentary, but can make sense of what is happening and being shown.",
          "What a great museum! If you have kids, this is a fun place to go. There is a fun room with mirror, water shooters, bubble makers, and other interactive devices that is a lot of fun and doesn't require any Japanese to enjoy. The special exhibit (dinosaur fossils in Mongolia) had",
          "We bought the combo ticket which included the Planetarium show. The only thing they told me was that my 2-year old had to sit in our lap. After the show began, my daughter looked at the moon on the screen and said \"Look the Moon\" not loud at all. We were sternly warned in",
          "It's a beautiful place located Central Nagoya. Has lovely park outside and the museum itself is amazing. Good place for kids to visit but even adults will like it as well. Dinosaur museum was lovely must see it.",
          "I used to go to Nagoya City Science Museum when I was a child, but this is the first time to visit the museum after they refurbished to have the largest planetarium in the world. We went there to see the special Mongolian dinosaurs' exhibition. As we went there on Wednesday,",

          "this is a nice science museum for the kids. near subway (about 2 blocks). very inexpensive (kids <12 free, adults 400 yen). lots of hands on stuff. don't need any japanese, most stuff is obvious. good for at least a few hours. didn't do planetarium based on other reviews.",
          "This outstanding facility really caters to children teaching them about various sciences. 7 floors high, each level is geared to an individual facet. Our main reason to visit was to see the planetarium, but as others have stated on here that no english is spoken so you must be",
          "The Nagoya City Science Museum is huge. It's a great place for kids and adults alike. I wanted to do all the hands-on things myself, but lots of kids were taking turns and having fun, so . . . It's more important for them to experience science. The museum has a huge wall",
          "We could have spent many more hours here...even though all the exhibits are in Japanese...he still really loved hanging out here and just kind of roaming from exhibit to exhibit and pushing every button in site. It was very unclear about having to get tickets for special",
          "This museum was close to our hotel so we decided to check it out. It was rainy outside so we figured we'd spend some time indoors. The museum was nicely set up and there was a ton to see and do. Every floor and section included hands-on demonstrations or activities about that",
          "so fun. BUT DONT PAY TO DO THE science observatory thingy because its all in japanese and i couldnt understand a word of it and fell asleep EVERYTHING ELSE IS GREATTTTTTTTTT!!! esp the deep freeze area, and the museum is huge!!! we had fun in the vending machines buying cakes",
          "I believe the place was wonderful. Every floor is packed with wonderful Science. Shouldn't be that bad for foreigners as well. Hands-on activity just drives people fun then the actual \"fact\". As for the very famous and well known planetarium. It was a disappointment. Too much",
          "Looks fascinating but unfortunately it lacks English signage and commentary. So it was completely useless to me. I imagine it would be a great place for Japanese kids, but wouldn't recommend it to a non-Japanese speaking tourist. We visited the planetarium and it looked awesome",
          "Lots of fun/educational scientific activities for every age group and the planetarium is excellent. Large swivel chairs and an hypnotic Japanese commentary. Lovely experience. The cafe in the court yard near the old steam train was also very nice and caters for all tastes."

          "English translations would help, but otherwise very interesting place.",
          "Nagoya City Science Museum is a great place; even a whole day wouldn't be sufficient to thoroughly explore the seven stages of three sections of the museum. This science museum seems to be the largest in Japan and it has the second largest \u2026",
          "The science museum is really well made and there are many activities for young children can experience and learn. The interior is very spacious and each floor is separated by themes. The only down size is that there are not many \u2026",

          "Icciban. Great museum",
          "Super cute place, was definitely worth a visit. To anyone from abroad, you can get audio guides at the entrance which we totally missed. The planetarium has shows but they're only held in Japanese so keep that in mind. Nevertheless, we went into one and just enjoyed the view :)",
          "This would be more interesting for kids or young students. The planetarium show was more like a classroom lecture than a show and only available in Japanese.",

          "It was a fun place to visit. Recommend for families with young kids. Teaches how tornados are formed, wind speed and many other topics",
          "More of an interactive kids science museum. Was great to look around.\n\nThere was a cold room experience which was the best thing ever. -30deg C was the coldest I've ever been",
          "Terrific science center, there are more displays than you'll have time to look at. The big silver globe is very impressive!",
          "Great place if you want to bring your children. Many activities are hands on. We had a great time",
          "Lots of science demonstration.  You don't need to know Japanese to understand.",
          "One of the best museums from Nagoya City. It is highly recommended to check their website in order to verify the availability of the planetarium for the day when one considers visiting.

          "Wonderful experience for the kids. Lots of hands-on activities for them. Lack of English support for the exhibits is not an issue. If you want to visit the planetarium, book in advance online. These shows are often sold out.",
          "Very cheap for students and a ton of fun experiments for young and old. Would recommend to anyone visiting Nagoya.",
          "Not enough reviews say this up front: everything is in Japanese. Super good museum with a lot to see and do on each floor. There was also a Marvel exhibition while I was there which was in English and Japanese. Had a fun time. Great place for kids as there are tons of interactive displays.",

        "wiki": "Legoland (trademark in uppercase as LEGOLAND) is a chain of family theme parks, which has its main focus on the construction toy system Lego. They are not fully owned by The Lego Group itself; rather they are owned and operated by the British theme park company Merlin Entertainments.\nThe Legoland Billund Resort opened in Billund, Denmark in 1968, followed by the Legoland Windsor Resort in Windsor, England in 1996. Further parks opened in Germany, Japan, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), and the United States (California and Florida). Parks in New York, South Korea, Shanghai, Sichuan and a Legoland Water Park at Gardaland are currently under construction.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nThe parks are marketed to families with younger children (11 and under), and although the attractions include a number of roller coasters, the roller coasters are not as numerous or as extreme as those in other parks, and there is a greater emphasis on rides suitable for younger children.\nLegoland parks are split into various areas, which are consistent among the chain's parks. For example, all six of the parks include a Lego miniland, a model village which includes models of landmarks and scenes from around the world, made from millions of genuine Lego bricks.\n\n\n=== Educational elements ===\n\nAn important aspect of Legoland is education and learning.\nExamples include:\n\nWater flow channels in which participants can construct dams from Lego blocks to understand laminar and turbulent fluid flows\nInteractive musical instruments, such as musical fountains, and the Aquatune hydraulophone, which is an underwater pipe organ in the shape of a giant  Lego block\nA Lego Mindstorms centre for fun-based learning\nDuplo Gardens (for smaller children)\nDriving area (including attractions such as Driving school, Boating school, Ballooning school, Flying school, and Fire Academy)\nMy Town\nWild Woods\nKnights' KingdomThe parks' rides are all Lego themed; many are made to appear as if they are built out of Lego bricks. They tend to be based on one particular line of Lego: for example, a popular ride at all six parks is the Dragon Coaster, which is loosely based on the Knights' Kingdom Lego sets. Another popular ride is the Driving school, in which children can drive small electric cars made to look like Lego cars around a small road network, after which they gain a mock driving licence.\nDespite the commonality of the above-mentioned attractions, the exact set of rides varies between parks, although as with the Disney parks there is some overlap.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nEurope\n\nNorth America\n\nAsia\n\n\n== Future parks ==\nNorth America\n\nAsia\n\n\n== Former parks ==\nThere was an earlier Legoland Park in Germany, from 1973 to 1976.  It was located in the city of Sierksdorf in northern Germany. In 1976, the park was sold; the former Legoland Sierksdorf is now Hansa-Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLegoland Discovery Centre\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website Legoland, Real Estate Investment Firm in Da Nang, Vietnam",

          "I\u2019ve been to Malaysia one and LA one. This is a tiny legoland. The beach party (water part) just a small area. You need to register and only 30 mins play. Then wait for next slot. Lucky that not so many people there. It\u2019s super hot in summer time. No need to spend 2 days here.",

          "Visited the park for about half a day, it is similar to the Legoland theme park in Malaysia. The main feature must be the mini land where there is a mini replica of the major landmarks in Japan. The submarine ride where one can see fishes is also quite entertaining. Most of the",
          "Much shorter line for online reedemtion ticket than purchasing on site . I went on a weekday, went straight lining up for popular games like under water ride and the dragon. But found out at 4/5pm, no one is lining up at any games. Take your time. Should have more than enough",
          "We finished the park in a day as it wasn't crowded. The shows and classes were all conducted in Japanese. The only exciting ride was \"The Apprentice\" roller coaster. The park is more suited for 5 years and under. Was also a bit disappointed that there weren't any Lego sets that",
          "I was thinking that ok its just for kids and i would just poctures of the different lego statues/structures but boy I was wrong! The rides was super fun. Eepecially those that involve water. The interaction was not just with the riders but with the visitors whose also watching",
          "It was our first time at a legoland and we had so much fun. I was there with two young kids and my elderly parents and we all enjoyed it. Most of the rides were suitable for all. But in general the rides are for younger kids below age 12. Older kids would want something more",
          "We took our family here with 2 young kids(boy 6 and girl 8). The price for entry with 1 day pass is excessive, having been told i should have purchased online 2 days in advance to save more than 50% on the entry price. The models were great and well built. But the rides were",
          "As both of us like Lego, it's a must-go when we visit Nagoya. The decorations are all good, but the rides are mostly designed for kids. So if you are not keen on Lego and looking for great adventures, this would not be a place you will enjoy.",
          "We did a quick visit while at Nagoya port which is not far. As a kid I loved LEGO, so I thoroughly enjoyed the creations especially in miniland. We didn\u2019t go on any rides but if we ever have grandkids, we would take them here. Kids get to be interactive as well. We enjoyed",
          "Legoland is a really fantastic environment for young children. Far less crowded than Disneyland in Tokyo which means you don't spend all day queuing and kids have space to run about. It also has lots of interactive games and play spots and is very clean. Our 1 year old had great",
          "The cost to enter the park is way overpriced. They are charging close to Disneyland prices for a park that is extremely small with a very limited number of rides geared towards very young children. On top of that, adults pay a much higher fee to enter the park, why so if this is",

          "If you come during the week and not during any school holidays, the park was virtually empty. It was stress free. I would also recommend combining the park with a night\u2019s stay at the hotel. You can get a two day pass for the price of one (including Sea Life which was not worth",

          "I went with my 3 year old son who loves Lego (Duplo). I would recommend a visit during a weekday when it is not crowded (which was our experience). I would on the other hand highly recommend avoiding it on busy days. My 3 star rating is kind of based on an average of these",
          "It is not so big but a very good playground for young kids. (Honestly, for elder child over 10+ years old, the rides are too simple and not so much attraction for them). Legoland is not crowded and my child has played almost all the rides he fits. Please note for the rides,",
          "Our kids really loved the place. The whole park isn't really big, but enough for one whole day visit. We got there around 10:30am, and didn't leave until 4:30pm. It is an easy train ride from Nagoya station, then a 10-15 walk. The park was not crowded, so we didn't have to wait",
          "I really liked our visit to Legoland albeit the size and lack of more thrilling ride. It was a Monday and the park was not crowded. My son got to ride everything that he desired and was happily looking at the miniland without that much people trying to pose and snap pictures",
          "Situated near Kinjo Futo Station. After alighting from train, it's a 10 mins walk away. Small kids might be tired by the time you reaxh Legoland entrance. Newly opened in April 2017, everything still looked new and colour-fast. Park itself is quite small, so the entrance fee",
          "We went there at Friday sunny day but still many facilities closed, no idea why but kinda frustrated. Many scenes and LEGO figures for photo shooting if u r a big fan. The park is not so big anyway but only few visitors there. There is a LEGO Hotel open soon so may draw more",
          "We visited this place on 8 Jan 2018. It was just end of the holiday season and so when we were there the place was quiet. The longest we had to queue was probably for 5 mins.. as there is hardly any line. I saw another poster saying the had to queue really bad, I'm guessing they",
          "This place is great if you have kids between 4-10 years old. The decoration of lego is great. There are many fun acitivities for kids. Also, many fun games are provided. Some are in water,some are in the air. Also lego building for famous sightseeing place in Japan is amazing.",
          "Ok, so I had prepurchased tickets online and turned up close to opening time with 4 of us in our party. The line just to get in (if you had purchased tickets online) was enormous. It snaked around the whole adjoining area. My husband looked at it and realised that by the time",
          "Husband and kids are lego maniacs, So this was there dream come true, The Park was small but it was great cause the day was wet and cold lines where short, That was the only down side it was wet and cold, if it didn\u2019t rain it would of been great, The miniland was awesome,",
          "My two grandsons were excited to go to LEGOLAND in Nagoya. They had visited LEGOLAND in Malaysia years ago, but were not able to enjoy the place because it rained on the day we visited the place. We chartered a van from Singapore and returned back, wet. We made a point",
          "I went to Legoland Japan in May 2017 during Japan late spring time. I went there with a friend on a weekday, Legoland Japan was not crowded at all. We spent a whole time having fun by taking photos. The games in this place is more for kids rather than adults. The show was spoken",
          "During the winter vacation, me and my family visited Legoland Japan in Nagoya. It was a good theme park as expected. Lots of ride attraction and play area to choose from. The themed restaurants were cool and offered good food.Best part was the mini land at the middle of the",

          "We visited on a Monday with children aged 4 and 7. Easy access via local train line. Minimal queues meant short waits for rides, and while the 4 year old didn\u2019t meet the minimum height on some rides (the ones limited to 105cm and above) there were plenty of options. We found the",
          "Legoland is definitely an amazing theme park for my 4 years old little daughter. I believe there should be always crowded after 11am. Before that, there was a very long queue awaiting out of the main entrance. I would suggest buying ticket online, 7 days before, to get big",
          "Travelled to Nagoya in late October this year and spent one day with two kids in LEGOLAND Japan. The kids are having so much fun especially the preschooler who is a big fan of Lego toys. But I would only rate it as an average amusement park. Actually the details are very good",
          "I am a AFOL and was really excited about being able to visit Legoland in Japan. Pros: The \u2018Miniland\u2019 exhibit was amazing with detailed Lego models of Japan\u2019s beautiful & famous landmarks. Cons: It was a terrible start, we arrived before 10am and had to waited over 1.5 hours in",
          "Installations are little but decent to spend a whole day. The extreme slowness, lack of people and long lines while carts leave half empty are hard to assume. Probably you will prefer spending your time in other things better than living in lines -more related to inefficiency",

Cool displays and a couple of okish rides. Great for ages 3-10. Anything higher is a bit of a waste. Still glad I saw it while I was over here though :)",

The attractions are a bit simple but all satisfied my 4 year old, who thought it was better than Disneyland. So not much for adults or bigger kids, but a great place for munchkins.",

Height limits (90cm and 130cm) and age (various) restrictions apply to some rides; I'd recommend waiting until children are 90cm+ but there is still lots to do if less than 90cm. Food/drinks were reasonably priced.  All staff seemed to speak english.",

          "1 day trip is justified and fully enjoyed. weather and kids friendly rides. could have more localized lego product. selection of lego products are not much diff from Singapore",
          "Closes at 6pm and food is not cheap. Legoland is super fun place for wee kids.",
          "small park but lots of nice lego figures to see",
          "Wonderful theme park for family with small children because almost activities are designed for kids. However, the decoration is colorful and cute enough to pusuade adults who love to take photos especially Miniland zone. If you are hungry, \u2026",
          "Could be better for how much it costs.",
          "The park itself is quite small but you still can enjoy most of the time at the small town in which many details are hidden.",
          "What a colorful world and wonderful lego professionals who have made those wonderful lego decorations",
          "If not for the 50% discounted price, this place is not worth it. Unless you are a  Lego nerd, don't bother visiting this place if you don't have a kid betwee 3~8.",
          "best place, but its rainy when we get ther so not so many games that we can play, so sad",
          "Nice attractions even though not all were ready. It closes on Tue and Wed (check their calendar). We went on Thu and no queue at all. Much more better than Malaysian Legoland where some attractions existed here but not there vice versa. Many restaurants are located outside the legoland so you don't need to pack bento like us :)",
          "Family can't miss, world class level",
          "Not so busy, not so many queues ... rides best for  ages for 5-10 ... below 5 may not be alllowed into many rides.",

          "Amazing park for kids",
          "A place where your childhood dreams come true! It's not everyday you see tiny LEGO blocks turned into massive monuments and figures, as well as attractions. For those who want more than just an attractions-based theme park, the world of LEGO is one that is well worth exploring. I'll be sure to give my kids an early start :)",
          "top for childrens",
          "Great for the kids, their parents and adults who happen to love Legos (like me). Be careful as you cannot get out to get lunch and have to queue up for the restaurant, which is kind of absurd. Don't be like me, and pack a lunch! ",
          "The best place for kids. Not too much people can play everything in one day.",
          "Today is sunny day,  but many and many games closed for some reason. I don't recommend my friend to come. Not worth for money.",
          "Worth a whole day visit. The theme park is designed for children aged 3~12, so adult visitor please do expect only gentle games.",
          "Great for kids 4-6 both in terms of content and size.  It also helped that it is not so crowded right now.  With that said, it is true that for similar money you do get a much larger park with more rides with Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea.",
          "Very commercialized, almost the same number of shops as there are rides. Park is very small for the 7000 yen fee. Spent 5 hours at the park and only did two rides. Each of which had a 30-45min wait. The themed playgrounds were awesome and \u2026",
          "For what the park is it's pretty expensive. I'm a big lego fan and so I went because of that. If it wasn't lego I don't think this park would last long. There are some decent rides, but if your kids are under 130cm they need to ride with \u2026",

        "wiki": "Kaku\u014dzan Nittai-ji (\u899a\u738b\u5c71\u65e5\u6cf0\u5bfa, Japan-Thailand Temple)  is a Buddhist temple located in the city of Nagoya, Aichi prefecture, Japan. It was built in 1904 in order to keep the ashes of Buddha, given to Japan by the Kingdom of Thailand. \u201d\u899a\u738b\u201d literally means \"Enlightenment King,\" referring to the Buddha, and \u201c\u65e5\u6cf0\u201d means Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand in Japanese. \nUsually, each temple in Japan belongs to a religious sect. However, Nittai-ji doesn\u2019t belong to any religious sect. Every three years, 19 religious sects take their turn to dispatch a chief priest to Nittai-ji. Usually, the ambassador of the Kingdom of Thailand visits Nittai-ji on his birthday.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Discovery of the Buddha's relics ===\nIn January 1898, a resident officer from Britain, William Peppe, discovered a pot of soapstone containing human bones when he was excavating a tumulus near the border of Nepal at Piprahwa. Some ancient lettering written on the side of the pot are thought to be dated around the 3rd century B.C. The script reads, \u201cThe pot of the holy remains of Buddha is enshrined with a heart of trust by wife, children, brothers and sisters, together with a Sakya clan in India, Sakya\u201d. This lends support for the historicity of a traditional belief expressed in Buddhist text, which claim that after the Buddha's death, he was cremated and the ashes of his remains were divided into eight portions. Some of the portion given to the Sakya clan was kept at Kapilavastu. \nIn the 19th century, many researchers believed the Buddha to be a product of legend. This discovery provided evidence for the Buddha as a historical person. The government of India decided to keep the pot in the Indian Museum in Kolkata and gave the ashes of the Buddha to the royal family of Thailand. King Chulalongkorn kept the ashes in Wat Saket and divided it into several portions as a gift to other Buddhist countries like Ceylon and Burma. \nWhen the minister of Japan, Manjiro Inagaki, heard the news, he requested that the king offer a portion of ashes to Japan. The king granted his request and presented a portion of the relics to Japan as a gift from the royal family of Thailand to the Japanese people.\n\n\n=== Founding Nittai-ji ===\nMr. Inagaki sent a letter about receiving the ashes of the Buddha to the foreign minister, Shuzo Aoki. Mr. Aoki immediately commanded all of the chiefs of Buddhist sects (13 sects and 56 sub sects) to prepare to receive the holy ashes. They held a conference and decided to receive the holy ashes. \nIn June 1900, a mission was organized in order to receive the holy ashes. The mission traveled to Thailand on June 15 of that year and received the holy ashes from King Chulalongkorn at the Royal Palace. They promised King Chulalongkorn to build a new temple not belonging to any Buddhist sect at which to enshrine the holy ashes. King Chulalongkorn also gave a one thousand year old gold-bronze statue of the Buddha, a national treasure in Thailand, to function as the main statue of the Buddha in the new temple. \nThe mission brought the holy ashes back to Japan and the holy ashes were temporarily kept at My\u014dh\u014d-in temple in Kyoto. Representatives from each Buddhist sect in Japan conferred about the new temple that would keep the holy ashes. After many conferences, they decided to build the temple in Nagoya. The Nagoya city government prepared 330,000 square meters of land to build the temple.

        "wiki": "Nagoya (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02, Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Ch\u016bbu region of Japan. It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people, making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.\nIn 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area\u2019s automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II. \nAfter the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.\nNagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city's name was historically written as \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce or \u540d\u8b77\u5c4b (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective nagoyaka (\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b), meaning 'peaceful'. [1]\nThe name Ch\u016bky\u014d (\u4e2d\u4eac), consisting of ch\u016b (middle) + ky\u014d (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area, Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nOda Nobunaga and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers (4.3 miles) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the Battle of Okehazama took place in Dengakuhazama, Owari Province which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the Sengoku period.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important T\u014dkaid\u014d road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\nDuring the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by government ordinance.\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningy\u014d.\nMitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II.\nAir raids began on April 18, 1942, with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant. The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale firebombing. Nagoya was the target of two of Bomber Command\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated 15.3 square kilometres (5.9 sq mi) . The XXI Bomber Command established a new U.S. Army Air Force record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945. Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959. Later in the same year on July 26th, 1945 the Enola Gay also dropped a conventional pumpkin bomb in the Yagoto area of Nagoya as part of a bombing raid in order to train for their mission to Hiroshima.In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography and administrative divisions ==\n\nNagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the N\u014dbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateaus to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, and the Sh\u014dnai River comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\nThe city's location and its position in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\n\nNagoya has 16 wards.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. The summer is noticeably wetter than the winter, although rain falls throughout the year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nOne of the earliest censuses, carried out in 1889, counted 157,496 residents. The population reached the 1 million mark in 1934 and as of December 2010 had an estimated population of 2,259,993 with a population density of 6,923 persons per km2. Also as of December 2010 an estimated 1,019,859 households resided there\u2014a significant increase from 153,370 at the end of World War II in 1945.The area is 326.45 square kilometres (126.04 sq mi).  Its metropolitan area extends into the Mie and Gifu prefectures, with a total population of about 10 million people, surpassed only by Osaka and Tokyo.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNagoya is the center of Greater Nagoya, which earned nearly 70 percent of Japan's 2003 trade surplus.\n\n\n=== Automotive industry ===\nNagoya's main industry is automotive. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus, Denso, Aisin Seiki Co., Toyota Industries, JTEKT and Toyota Boshoku have their headquarters in or near Nagoya. Mitsubishi Motors has an R&D division in the suburb of Okazaki. Major component suppliers such as Magna International and PPG also have a strong presence here. Spark plug maker NGK and Nippon Sharyo, known for manufacturing rolling stock including the Shinkansen are headquartered there.\n\n\n=== Aviation industry ===\nThe aviation history has historically been of importance since the industrialization. During the war the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter was constructed in Nagoya. The aviation tradition continues with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation headquartered in the Nagoya Airfield's terminal building in Komaki. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft is produced at a factory adjacent to the airport. The MRJ is a partnership between majority owner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota with design assistance from Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries, already a manufacturer of aircraft. It is the first airliner designed and produced in Japan since the NAMC YS-11 of the 1960s. The MRJ's first flight was on November 11, 2015.\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nJapanese pottery and porcelain has a long tradition due to suitable clay being available in Owari Province. Before and during the Edo period there were two main kilns in the region: Seto and Tokoname. In Nagoya Castle a type of oniwa-yaki (literally \"garden ware\") called Ofukei ware was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own oniwa-yaki, also to have gifts made. In the town itself Toyoraku ware and Sasashima ware Japanese tea utensils were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord Tokugawa Yoshinao and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the Edo period. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as Hirasawa Kur\u014d and Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d, who made their own pieces.\nToyoraku ware continued on until the Taish\u014d era under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white Kawana ware. With the advent of industrialisation during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old Noritake, also Nagoya E-tsuke (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8) became popular.Production of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as INAX, NGK, and NGK Insulators.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"karakuri ningy\u014d\", are a traditional craft from the area. Robot technology is another rapidly developing industry.\nA materials engineering industry is developing.Brother Industries, which is known for office electronics such as multifunction printers is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, which is known for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment. Many small machine tool and electronics companies are also based in the area.The World Expo 2005, also known as Aichi Expo was held near Nagoya in the neighboring cities of Nagakute and Seto from March 25 to September 25, 2005.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nRetail is of importance in the city. Traditional department stores with roots in Nagoya are Matsuzakaya, Maruei and the Meitetsu Department Store. Oriental Nakamura was bought by Mitsukoshi from Tokyo in 1977.\n\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nThe Owari province was historically well known for the cloisonn\u00e9 art form. The Ando Cloisonn\u00e9 Company continues the long tradition.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Confectionery company Marukawa is well known.\nThe city offers venues for conferences and congresses such as the Nagoya Congress Center and the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nNagoya is served by Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO), built on an artificial island in Tokoname. The airport has international flights and a high volume of domestic flights.\nA second airport is Nagoya Airfield (Komaki Airport, NKM) near the city's boundary with Komaki and Kasugai. On February 17, 2005, Nagoya Airport's commercial international flights moved to Centrair Airport. Nagoya Airfield is now used for general aviation and as an airbase and is the main Fuji Dream Airlines hub.\nNagoya Station, the world's largest train station by floor area, is on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, and the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, among others. JR Central, which operates the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, has its headquarters there. Meitetsu is also based in Nagoya, and along with Kintetsu provides regional rail service to the T\u014dkai and Kansai regions. Nagoya Subway provides urban transit service.\nNagoya Port is the largest port by international trade value in Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation exports via this port.\nNagoya is known for its orderly grid street plan for which the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu is ultimately responsible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNagoya has mostly state-run primary and secondary schools. The area in the city limits includes international schools such as the Nagoya International School and Col\u00e9gio Brasil Jap\u00e3o Prof. Shinoda Brazilian school.State and private colleges and universities primarily located in the eastern area. Some Western-style institutions were founded early in the Meiji era, with more opening during the Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa eras. Nagoya University was set up in 1871 as a medical school and has produced six Nobel Prize laureates in science. Nanzan University was established by the Roman Catholic Society of the Divine Word in 1932 as a high school and expanded to include Nanzan Junior College and the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. The main campus was designed in the 1960s by the renowned architect Antonin Raymond.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era.

It is also called Owari dialect (\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01, Owari-ben). The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to standard Japanese and to the Kansai dialect, differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city is centuries old.\n\nArimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\nGeta clog straps: wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\nShippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\nCandles: wax is taken from a wax tree and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (washi) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\nYuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\nSekku Ningyo: festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\nThe city also gave its name to a type of obi, the sash that is used to tie a kimono. The term Nagoya obi can refer to an older type of obi used centuries ago. This type was cord-like. The current Nagoya obi (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) \u2013 or to differentiate from the fukuro Nagoya obi, also called ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi (\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"nine-inch nagoya obi\") \u2013 is the most-used obi type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The Nagoya obi was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear. A more formal version is called the Fukuro Nagoya obi (\u888b\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?) or hassun Nagoya obi (\u516b\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?, \"eight-inch Nagoya obi\"), which is more formal.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe city and the region are known for its unique local Nagoya cuisine (\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u3081\u3057, Nagoya meshi). Dishes include: \n\nTebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori\nTenmusu: a rice ball wrapped with nori that is filled with deep-fried tempura shrimp\nKishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot.\nRed miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce and miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup)\nHitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container.

        "wiki": "Qingdao ([t\u0255\u02b0\u00ed\u014bt\u00e0u]; also spelled Tsingtao; Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b) is a major sub-provincial city in eastern Shandong province, China. Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nS16 Rongwei Expressway (Rongcheng-Weifang)\nS19 Longqing Expressway (Longkou-Qingdao)\nS21 Xinwei Expressway (Xinhe-Weifang)\nS24 Weiqing Expressway (Weihai-Qingdao)Other than Expressways, there are also National Highways that pass through or begin in Qingdao. National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).The Orient Ferry connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The New Golden Bridge II operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the Blue Sea Ferry operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.Qingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, 23 km (14 mi) away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\n\n=== Intercity rail ===\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin. T The fastest train between Qingdao and Beijing is G206 / G205 times, 2 hours and 58 minutes neededDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses as of 2012.There are also 136 trolleybuses as of 2012. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (\u9752\u5c9b\u5361), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. After that, all public transportation companies use Qingdaotong Card, the last company started to use this card is Zhenqing bus company located in The West Coast New Area of Qingdao (original Huangdao Distinct) in 2019.\nNon air-conditioned buses cost 1 yuan (excluding the tunnel bus), The volume of road passenger transport approaches 737 million per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus (\u65e5\u65b0\u5df4\u58eb)' is also known in China.\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of 54.7 km (34.0 mi) of subway line 3 was completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for 231.5 km (143.8 mi) in future. As of end of May 2018, the system has an operating length of 170 km (110 mi), lines in operation including Line 2, Line 3, Line 11, and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\n\nQingdao Tram, her official name is: Modern tram demonstration line of Chengyang District, Qingdao, is a tram system operating in Chengyang District, Qingdao, China. It opened in 2016. The Qingdao Public Transport Group Rail Bus Co., Ltd. is responsible for operation and management. The system is only composed of 1 bus line.\n\n\n== Military ==\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThere are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898\u20131914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R.

Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u8bdd; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo hu\u00e0) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard Mandarin, most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect.

This now 440 meter (1,443.6 ft)-long strip stretches into the sea and was the first wharf at Qingdao. An octagonal pavilion called the Billowing Back and Forth Tower (Huilan Pavilion), loosely translated, stands at the end of the pier and was constructed in 1930.  The pier itself was started in 1891 and frequently enlarged.  Zhanqiao Pier appears on the label of the Tsingtao Brewery beer bottles and the front of cans.\nAlso in the vicinity of Zhanqiao Pier is the small Qingdao Island (Xiao Qingdao), the China Navy Museum, and many neighborhoods featuring German colonial architecture.  The coastline lights up at night with spotlights on nearby buildings and several neon billboards.\n\n\n== Main attractions ==\nHuilan Pavilion (\u56de\u703e\u95a3) is located in the coastal area of the Shinan District.\nZhongshan Road (\u4e2d\u5c71\u8def) was built in 1897, during the German colonial period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nQingdao\nJiaozhou Bay\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We walked out to the end of the pier where we viewed the museum about the history of the pier. Many people were taking photos of the city, and there must have been at least 10 kiosks where someone would take your photo. It was a very popular place!",
          "And that's about it. It's a pier and not much else. Nice on a sunny day. You can also enter the building but I found the admission was not worth it as a peek through the window just showed a small room with Chinese texts.",
          "Zhanqiao pier is located at the southern shore of Qingdao. It is 440m long and stretches into the sea. Zhanqiao is the first wharf at Qingdao and apparently it is also where the Germans disembarked to attack Qingdao. An octagonal pavilion called the Billowing Back and Forth",

          "We hired a taxi to the bridge and it was less than $20 from CBD area. The bridge was a long board walk leading to a pagoda. The best part of this visit is that you can view the old and new parts of Qingdao on both sides of the board walk while enjoying endless ocean breeze and",

          "As there is only limited attractions in Qingdao I guess you really have to go for a walk down the pier. Even just to get a feel for the history with the information in the pavilion at the end of the pier. A popular spot for locals it is usually pretty busy and a good people",
          "As a student that's been in Qingdao for a year now, I think you really need to visit Zhangqiao Pier if you get the chance. However, if you can go during the week, preferably at a time when few people are around, I'd highly recommend it; I've been there multiple times, but have",

          "We walked along the Pier. And when we reached the end we had a lock around. After that we went back. For us it was not so interesting. Actually we not went into the house. Too many people waiting in line",
          "It's no different to other piers around the world. Very crowded on the weekend and really a place for a stroll. There's speed boats that take you out to an \"island\" but a few of them looked in very poor condition and maybe safety concerns?",
          "The Zhanqiao pier is of course famous as the logo of the Tsingtao beer brand. It's a nice stroll down the pier in summer but always extremely crowded on a half decent day and not much to see once you've reached the end. For best views I recommend going to little qingdao island",

          "nice place to visit as long as you are not crowd-crazy. Because I guarantee a crowd all 4 seasons. Vendors are nice, near Cathedral and old-town German. Fun to watch the Chinese tourist crazies in action.",
          "I didn't go into the building at the end of the pier, which perhaps costs money), but I did walk around outside and took some shots. Add this to your must-see list if you're into taking photos. There were some Chinese Navy ships in port that you could see in the distance.",
          "Extremely popular place to walk at weekends this quaint pier was very busy. A little dated were the numerous photo booths offering to take group photos whist we were surrounded by a sea of mobile phones. If its cool do take a coat. Nice to take in as part of a walk along the",
          "This must be the top attraction in Qingdao, as despite being off peak, the pier was still crowded with many tourists, eager to photograph every different vantage points of the Hui Lan Ge pavilion. Don't let the crowd deter you, one would still marvel at its build and beauty",

          "Nothing really special about the pier. However, if your in Qingdao it is something to do and gives you a water front view of the city. Not sure if it is better at night or during the day. Lights of the city at night are nothing to write home about. Not like Hong Kong. Anyway,",
          "You can take a public transport & walk under a tunnel to get to the pier. Be prepared to see snacks, souvenirs & clothes while you walk along the tunnel. They close the pier once they discover that the waves is strong, even as early as 2-3pm.",
          "It was my first place to sightsee while in Qingdao. Because it was so crowded, it made it less enjoyable. The temple at the end is good for a couple of shots but that's about it. The view of the pier looks better from Luzin Park. But it's not far from the Catholic Church, which",
          "This is a nice pier to watch people strolling. There is also a hutong lookalike building at the tip of the pier. We visited the pier on a saturday evening and it was very crowded. The weather was hot and sticky but the pier was great to hang around. People were trying to pick up",
          "Went to visit at 8 pm.lots of people strolling. Interesting to see people catching crabs n shellfish n fish on the rocks around. Pleasant walk",
          "The fresh humid air with the market consisting of pearls necklaces, artifacts made from sea pearls and people fishing",
          "We went there at night. And the view was excellent. There were some small souvenir shops and the wind was just awesome. There were two singers singing some really nice songs for the tourists.",
          "This is a great place to go with kids. There are beautiful views, lots of vendors, and a nice walking pier with a beautiful pagoda-like structure on the end. This is a place with a lot of history that is uniquely Qingdao.",
          "Nice stroll along this pier which was extended by the Germans when they developed the City. Views across the bays. Makes a great evening walk and the surrounding rocks and beaches great for crabbing. Nearby restaurants.",
          "We live near here so it's a great place to visit. It can get really crowded in the summer, but that can also make it interesting. There are quite a lot of other things to do in the area as well.",
          "although it was built in qing dynasty for military purpose, it is a beautiful scene at present. you can stand on it and enjoy the natural view of sea, and also can take a boat from there to the sea and enjoy the cityscape of qingdao.",

          "The pier is a perfect place to take a leisure walk to admire the beauty surrounding it. Walking to the end of the pier, looking out or looking in were both beautiful n serene.",
          "The pier is nothing exceptional, but the view back to the shore is nice. It's very much a locals haunt. We walked from here to the Catholic Church, which was quite an interesting walk.",
          "It was nice to see but nothing special. Lots of people feeding seagulls with bread and a short walk to the end. At low tide you can see many local foraging for seaweed and presumably small shellfish.",
          "The place is somewhat crowded but the sunset view is totally worth it. The walk is serene and relaxing. Beware of the street hawkers though, they are relentless and can be a little aggressive to make a sale.",
          "The day we went here was misty and moody. You couldn't see the end of the pier from the beach due to the mist. Still, we walked out to the temple and back again. Our teens were a bit bored and preferred to run on the sand and rocks. The temple wasn't open on our visit but",
          "For those who have visited many seaside towns, it is just a pier with lots of people on it and a temple at the end of it. If you haven't visited the seaside before then it is worth visiting.",
          "It was low tide when we visited this pier/bridge which is also known as the Zhan Bridge. It was interesting to see people fossicking in the rocks exposed by the low tide. Entry into the pagoda at the end of the bridge was RMB4 but there did not appear to be too many people",
          "The pier was across the road from our hotel, well located for a brisk morning walk. It's 440 metres long and gets very busy with tourists and locals, so best to go early in the day. It's illuminated at night, really lovely.",
          "The pavilion set at the end of the Zhanqiao Pier is one of true landmarks of Qingdao. It is also famous nationwide due to its place on the label of Tsingtao Beer, the most popular beer in the nation. Dating back about a century, the pavilion is designed in Ming Dynasty style",

          "It's a historical site with beautiful sea views. It was crowed though and not much going on around the place. Expected to walk around for about an hour and go somewhere else.",
          "Zhanqiao Pier is an iconic symbol of Qingdao. It is visibly distinctive with her octagonal pavilion right at the end of the Pier. Standing at the pavilion, the panoramic beautiful skyline and the gorgeous coastline of Qingdao spread out like a piece of master art in front of",
          "Zhanqiao Pier, located at the coastal area at the southern end of Zhongshan Road, it is an extension of the road into the sea. It is just about 0.3 miles from Qingdao Railway Station. At the south end of the bridge is a Chinese style octagon pavilion. Some small art exhibitions",
          "A narrow pier with a (very) small building at the end. It may be one of the most symbolic sights in Qingdao, but it is rather disappointing.",
          "No big deal here, just a pier and not much else. I think you are better off going to the island across the way and taking photos from there.",
          "Nice view over the bay once you find a spot to enjoy it. You walk down Zhongshan Lu and you will hit it.",
          "I'd definitely go if I was you! You must capture the moment when you're in company of the symbol of the city. I rated it 3 stars because my experience wasn't the best. It was horrendously crowded. We only had the time to go half way, take a photo and walk back. Be aware of the",

          "This is another site that you absolutely have to visit if you go to Qingdao, because it is just so iconic. You can spend as little as twenty minutes here or you can spend longer -- it's a pretty place to visit, there's a beach (though I wouldn't swim there), there are loads of",
          "Seeing the pier lit up at night is definitely a nice photo opportunity. However, the pier has been overtaken by beggars, street musicians and merchants trying to capitalize on tourists. Walk around the evening and see everyone looking for crabs on the rocks. The sight is",
          "We took a walk to this pier and had a peer into everyday life of ithis costal city.Many locals enjoying the area.What looked like older Veterans had a display set up. The tide was out and in the shallow water and stones was filled with adults and children with buckets",
          "Watch the sunset in Zhan Qiao. Not much really, just a temple at the end of the pier and I didn't even bother going into the temple. But I do enjoy a short walk along the pier with beautiful sunset. You can see a few artistes along the pier performing on street for money.",
          "It is because Qingdao's ICON that you should visit here! At any time, you can see many people walking to get this place. And so relaxing just to look at this seaside. The problem is that these days you cannot enjoy Quingdao without wearing a mask to avoid polluted air. (to tell",

          "The pier is not too spectacular but the view of the bay is nice from the end. The entrance fee of the pavilion makes one curious but the exhibition (turtles !?!?) is rather strange.",
          "Use as logo for tsianghao beer; we decided to pay a visit after touring beer museum. It is long walk towards pagoda and many beggars and musician are seen. We enter pagoda with a fee and it was waste of money. Only shops and you cant eveb see the view from top. Walk around",
          "I absolutely loved here! Visited in Oct 2011. This was the first sea port city that I've visited in China next to Dalian. Under the underground passage ways, you can find freshed made steamed crabs for 30 yuan. You can also find photographers who are ready to ask you take photos",

        "wiki": "Qingdao ([t\u0255\u02b0\u00ed\u014bt\u00e0u]; also spelled Tsingtao; Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b) is a major sub-provincial city in eastern Shandong province, China. Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao.

National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).The Orient Ferry connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The New Golden Bridge II operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the Blue Sea Ferry operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.Qingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, 23 km (14 mi) away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\n\n=== Intercity rail ===\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin. T The fastest train between Qingdao and Beijing is G206 / G205 times, 2 hours and 58 minutes neededDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses as of 2012.There are also 136 trolleybuses as of 2012. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (\u9752\u5c9b\u5361), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. After that, all public transportation companies use Qingdaotong Card, the last company started to use this card is Zhenqing bus company located in The West Coast New Area of Qingdao (original Huangdao Distinct) in 2019.\nNon air-conditioned buses cost 1 yuan (excluding the tunnel bus), The volume of road passenger transport approaches 737 million per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus (\u65e5\u65b0\u5df4\u58eb)' is also known in China.\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of 54.7 km (34.0 mi) of subway line 3 was completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for 231.5 km (143.8 mi) in future. As of end of May 2018, the system has an operating length of 170 km (110 mi), lines in operation including Line 2, Line 3, Line 11, and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\n\nQingdao Tram, her official name is: Modern tram demonstration line of Chengyang District, Qingdao, is a tram system operating in Chengyang District, Qingdao, China. It opened in 2016. The Qingdao Public Transport Group Rail Bus Co., Ltd. is responsible for operation and management. The system is only composed of 1 bus line.\n\n\n== Military ==\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThere are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898\u20131914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R. Lilley, U.S. diplomat\nMa Jian (\u9a6c\u5efa)\nXiao Hong (\u8427\u7ea2)\nXiao Jun (\u8427\u519b)\nDuanmu Hongliang (\u7aef\u6728\u857b\u826f)\nErin Pizzey, (was born in Qingdao)\nLi Zhaoxing (\u674e\u8087\u661f)\nZhang Ruimin (\u5f20\u745e\u654f)\nVictoria Song (\u5b8b\u831c, f(x))\nHuang Zitao (\u9ec4\u5b50\u97ec, musician, actor)\nHuang Bo (\u9ec4\u6e24)\nZhang Jike (\u5f20\u7ee7\u79d1)\nGao Fenghan (\u9ad8\u51e4\u7ff0)\nToshiro Mifune (was born in Qingdao)\nLi Cunxin (\u674e\u5b58\u4fe1)\nHuang Xiaoming (\u9ec4\u6653\u660e)\nChen Hao (\u9648\u597d)\nXia Yu (\u590f\u96e8)\nFan Bingbing (\u8303\u51b0\u51b0, born in Qingdao)\nBai Baihe (\u767d\u767e\u5408)\nHao Haidong (\u90dd\u6d77\u4e1c)\nWang Dong (\u738b\u680b, Chinese Footballer)\nZhang Juanjuan (\u5f20\u5a1f\u5a1f ,archer)\nMalcolm H. Wiener, (was born in Qingdao)\nNi Ping (\u502a\u840d)\nTang Guoqiang (\u5510\u56fd\u5f3a)\n\n\n=== Movies shot in Qingdao ===\nA Better Tomorrow 2018 (\u82f1\u96c4\u672c\u82722018) 2016\nThe Great Wall (\u957f\u57ce) 2016\nUnderdog Fight (\u786c\u6c49) 2008\nUnderdog Fight II (\u786c\u6c49 II) 2013\nOcean Heaven (\u6d77\u6d0b\u5929\u5802) 2010\nBeauty Remains (\u7f8e\u4eba\u4f9d\u65e7) 2005\n\n\n=== Language ===\nDuring the city's leased-territory days, German was the official language and rigorously taught and promoted. Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u8bdd; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo hu\u00e0) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard Mandarin, most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nSeafood is a typical delicacy of the coastal city, divided into two categories: \"Great Seafood\" including sea cucumbers, abalones, shark's fin, prawns, crabs, conch, and some big fish, and \"Little Seafood\" comprising squid, shrimps, octopus, oysters, razor clams, clams, periwinkles, yellow croakers, etc.\nThe distinctive cuisine of the area is Lu Cai, the Shandong regional style.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nNotable festivals include:\n\nQingdao International Horticultural Exposition 2014 is the biggest international fair that has been held in the history of the city.\nQingdao International Beer Festival in August/September, held annually since 1991.\n\n\n== Media ==\nQingdao previously had a large German community and a German garrison, so three German newspapers operated in Qingdao. German papers included Deutsch-Asiatische Warte (traditional Chinese: \u6cf0\u6771\u53e4\u4eca\u9451; simplified Chinese: \u6cf0\u4e1c\u53e4\u4eca\u9274; pinyin: T\u00e0id\u014dng G\u01d4j\u012bn Ji\u00e0n; weekly newspaper published until 1906, included Die Welt des Ostens, Altes und Neues aus Asiens drei Kaiserreichen, a cultural supplement), the Tsingtauer Neueste Nachrichten and the Kiautschou Post (a daily paper published from 1908 to 1912, referring to the Kiautschou (Jiaozhou) Bay concession). German publishing in Qingdao ended after World War I and the beginning of the Japanese administration.A 1912 publication of the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce said that the Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina of Tianjin was read in Qingdao, and that major newspapers from Shanghai were also read in Qingdao.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nQingdao attracts many tourists due to its seaside setting and temperate weather.

          "I was on a school trip and it was nodt a pleasant trip. We wanted to go to Polar Ocean World but was told by the cab drivers that it was too far and traffic was bad and recommended us to the Underwater world. The cab driver said it was newer and better. We were driven to a road",
          "I have visited aquariums in Osaka, Atlanta, Lisbon, Munich and this one certainly stands out as an appalling example of sea life display. Yes, the place was overcrowded with pushy groups of people. Yes, this place is not stroller friendly. Yes, the displays frequently lack",
          "Reading the reviews of 'Underwater World Qingdao', We felt disappointed because it was a place we really looked forward to visiting... With some thought and more research I suggested we should just go visit. So we did, and we had little negative reviews of the trip.. You can",
          "Coming from Seattle, and having visited many aquariums, we were a little disappointed. Not a lot of live tanks, and many paper mache displays make up most of your experience. To it's credit, however, there was great information in multiple languages on what you were seeing.",
          "A nice place to visit if in Qingdao, good collection and good nearby view, it's worth visiting if you are staying in Qingdao for long.",
          "We went there with 2 toddlers in the strollers, first there\u2019s subway a bit far away from it, then when you get there and get the tickets, you are getting in. There\u2019s no easy access for strollers, many stairs inside the place, we had to lift strollers and kids, also the stuff is",
          "Worthwhile, especially if your kids are Octonaut fans. All sorts of specimen jars as you go in, then some dodgy taxidermy and a huge model sperm whale and then diwn into the underwater world bit with big rays and a conveyor belt walkway. We went in the afternoon and it was",
          "We went here with friends and our child, and we would never ever go back again. There were just as many stuffed animals as real ones, and those that were stuffed were stuffed very poorly. There was minimal upkeep of the area, and the lighting was atrocious. Please don't come",
          "What a rather nice surprise we had when we visited this gem in the sea of other Chinese attractions. While it was overpriced (by Western standards) we did see a number of species which I have not seen before (I come from a coastal town). It is a definite must-see for those",
          "While not spectacular by western standards (Ripley aquarium in Toronto, planetarium in Montreal, for example), it was still worth spending a couple hours here. The layout of the place is curious - starting with scientific specimens in jars - and eventually you work your way up",
          "The Dolphin show is the best. Large overhead aquarium with variety of fish. Plan a half day to explore.",
          "Was better than I assumed it would be, but in China sights with live animals tend to be a saddening experience. The aquarium is overpriced but again in China most sights are. The museum portion starts well with decent displays but soon turns into horribly hand stitched displays",
          "We read the reviews and decided to go anyway and were positively surprised by what we saw. The only bad bit was the mammal area which was very smelly and a little dirty. The rest of the exhibits were well maintained and clean and my daughter really enjoyed the experience. We",

          "When we first walked it, it was full of exhibits and models of sea creatures , skeletons, and jars of preserved sea animals. And we almost feared that that was it, so we were relieved when we found the actual start of the aquarium. Overall, we found that it was everything as",
          "If you like Marine you will love this Centre. separate exhibits include the underwater walkway, fabulous tower tank, turtles, penguins and sealion enclosure and a fascinating Jelly fish centre in addition to the fossil museum. We were there longer than anticipated as it was all",
          "I was really enjoying my visit to the Underwater World. Very tasteful and resourceful. But i feel quite sad for the poor Beluga Whale in its small pool.... this is clearly inhumane :-(",
          "If you go here, expect to be confused with how to navigate the place. I was able to find three of the four buildings but gave up trying to figure out looking for the last one. Other than that, the only thing that really impressed me were the jelly fish and one tank where a sea",
          "Well, in fact it was smaller than it was talked about. The place more for small kids, and mostly it gets kids with all the toy stores and play area. As for underwater creatures, not much. its not really big so don't expect to spend there a day.",
          "We went there, and pretty much walked through the place in under an hour because it was not that interesting, was overcrowded, people pushing everywhere, kids peeing where they shouldn't pee, etc",
          "Good to come with kids, but avoid weekends if you don't like noisy, crowded places. Too much halls with stuffed fishes.",
          "It is a very nice aquarium. I liked the penguins, seals, walruses and particularly the beluga whales performing with the divers underwater. Everything looked clean and the sealife looked very healthy. There were lots of children (it was Children's Day), but it didn't seem",
          "This is a mix between a traditional Western aquarium and a biology classroom full of dead things in jars with formaldehyde. Some of the things in jars are worth seeing. But you can't help but feel creeped out at the sheer volume of preserved dead things. It seems the Chinese",
          "Going on a holiday weekend was our first mistake, as we were herded into the strange museum that begins this tour. The museum is not meant for English speaking tourists but that was ok as it was so bad. The constant gift shops you are forced through are also annoying. However",
          "Very nice place to see but the only comments we have is that they should make able for wheelchair and baby trollers. Having stair a bit everywhere is uncomfortable to go around. And the last thing is the toilets for kids are not available when you know that so many kids goes",
          "I have been to several of these aquarium type attractions in various countries and this was as good as any. The difference would be the crowds! It is a popular attraction so avoid the usual peak periods. Great place to take the kids.",
          "This is a very good aquarium with different Maine lives. It was very interesting to spent about 2 hours.. Really heart touching the fun dressed girls who can't talk and hear, posing for photos outside the aquarium in different cartoon costumes....",
          "Been the Ripley's Aquarium in Toronto. This isn't much worse at a much lower price. There's even a cool area where you get fish to nibble on your fingers!",
          "My friend recommended checking out an aquarium, but didn't say which one. This city has three! I didn\u2019t know a city could have three!? I don't think this was the best one unfortunately, but the jellyfish were nice and they had one of those cool glass tunnels with the rays and",
          "Unfortunately the place has seen better days. The areas were dirty and smelly and the static displays were very old and dirty. The tanks didn't look like they were well filtered, and we felt bad for the animals. One exception was the jellyfish room. I never knew there were that",
          "After waiting 1 hour for a ticket, my husband and I were pushed into a room with about 200 other people... we were not able to get near the displays, so we sadly left before seeing anything.",
          "It can be crowded, but good visit if you have kids in particular. Otherwise, its average relative to other underwater aquariums.",
          "Good Dolphin & Seal Show. They have very good water creature. Its very good learning experience for Kids. You can get good value for money. Its nice place to spend 2 / 3 hours.",
          "It is worth the entrance fee alone to stand on the moving walkway and travel through the underwater tunnel. There really is a lot to see here. I know many of the preserved specimens are a bit of an old fashioned way of displaying zoological information but the sheer scale of the",
          "Let's be honest here, when you are visiting China you are visiting a country that is still new in the entertainment industry, the way they manage parks in China is completely different than in the U.S , due to the fact that we have a bunch of regulations that protect animals, do",

          "Entrance feels that you are in a science/natural history museum with exhibits in glass jars and stuffed whales but once you have passed these you see live marine life. Travelator takes you through the main aquarium with rays and sharks swimming over your head, really cool.",

          "I really enjoyed this, much to my surprise, but I went on a quiet day. Later in my visit, I passed it on a bus and there were huge queues. The shark/ray tunnel was really excellent; the static/stuffed exhibits were interesting; there were a lot of strange fish and eels that I",
          "The Qingdao underwater world is showing its age with many old displays that need updating. The winter is not a good time to visit outside attractions.The summer would be a much better time to spend some time wandering the outside areas.",
          "Maybe I had too high expectations on the underwater world, because the city is a seaside city.Actually it's small, no much to see, just some very common species, as you can see in any inland cities. It does not worth the money of 120 yuan entrance fee.",
          "So the title pretty much says it all. It cost 120 RMB to do everything that was available. This gave me access to the underwater world, some mammals and the jellyfish exibit. Out of all of these the best section was the jellyfish exibit. 120 RMB is no too bad for a tourist",
          "When not living in China we live in San Francisco which not only has aquariums of its own, it is close to the mother of all: the Monterey Bay Aquarium. So this place, with small tanks and big creatures, seems a bit sad. It was not as bad as some of the zoos but still. The",
          "Worth a visit if you like sea life. Easy to follow and full of diffident interesting fish. Not mush in English but easy to follow.",
          "Most tourist coming to Qingdao go here or to the polor ocean world. The polar ocean world is definitly nicer but the Underwater world has the better temperature control. I would make it up on the wether. If you need aircon or heating go to the underwater world, otherwise choose",
          "We didn't intend on going here but walked past and thought 'why not'? It didn't cost all that much Y170 for 2 adults and 1 child and it was kind of fun looking at all the fish and crustaceans. It was not a flashy exhibition but that was what made it kind of endearing. The",

          "Did I mention the two huge Lemonsharks in a 500 gallon tank with the top only covered by netting. There is sign that says no hands or feeding near here. Duh. Incredible size up so close to the public. Nothing like that in the states happens. I like it though."

It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nS16 Rongwei Expressway (Rongcheng-Weifang)\nS19 Longqing Expressway (Longkou-Qingdao)\nS21 Xinwei Expressway (Xinhe-Weifang)\nS24 Weiqing Expressway (Weihai-Qingdao)Other than Expressways, there are also National Highways that pass through or begin in Qingdao. National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).The Orient Ferry connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The New Golden Bridge II operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the Blue Sea Ferry operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.Qingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, 23 km (14 mi) away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\n\n=== Intercity rail ===\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin. T The fastest train between Qingdao and Beijing is G206 / G205 times, 2 hours and 58 minutes neededDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses as of 2012.There are also 136 trolleybuses as of 2012. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (\u9752\u5c9b\u5361), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. After that, all public transportation companies use Qingdaotong Card, the last company started to use this card is Zhenqing bus company located in The West Coast New Area of Qingdao (original Huangdao Distinct) in 2019.\nNon air-conditioned buses cost 1 yuan (excluding the tunnel bus), The volume of road passenger transport approaches 737 million per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus (\u65e5\u65b0\u5df4\u58eb)' is also known in China.\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of 54.7 km (34.0 mi) of subway line 3 was completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for 231.5 km (143.8 mi) in future. As of end of May 2018, the system has an operating length of 170 km (110 mi), lines in operation including Line 2, Line 3, Line 11, and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\n\nQingdao Tram, her official name is: Modern tram demonstration line of Chengyang District, Qingdao, is a tram system operating in Chengyang District, Qingdao, China. It opened in 2016. The Qingdao Public Transport Group Rail Bus Co., Ltd. is responsible for operation and management. The system is only composed of 1 bus line.\n\n\n== Military ==\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThere are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898\u20131914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R.

Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u8bdd; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo hu\u00e0) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard Mandarin, most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nSeafood is a typical delicacy of the coastal city, divided into two categories: \"Great Seafood\" including sea cucumbers, abalones, shark's fin, prawns, crabs, conch, and some big fish, and \"Little Seafood\" comprising squid, shrimps, octopus, oysters, razor clams, clams, periwinkles, yellow croakers, etc.\nThe distinctive cuisine of the area is Lu Cai, the Shandong regional style.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nNotable festivals include:\n\nQingdao International Horticultural Exposition 2014 is the biggest international fair that has been held in the history of the city.\nQingdao International Beer Festival in August/September, held annually since 1991.\n\n\n== Media ==\nQingdao previously had a large German community and a German garrison, so three German newspapers operated in Qingdao. German papers included Deutsch-Asiatische Warte (traditional Chinese: \u6cf0\u6771\u53e4\u4eca\u9451; simplified Chinese: \u6cf0\u4e1c\u53e4\u4eca\u9274; pinyin: T\u00e0id\u014dng G\u01d4j\u012bn Ji\u00e0n; weekly newspaper published until 1906, included Die Welt des Ostens, Altes und Neues aus Asiens drei Kaiserreichen, a cultural supplement), the Tsingtauer Neueste Nachrichten and the Kiautschou Post (a daily paper published from 1908 to 1912, referring to the Kiautschou (Jiaozhou) Bay concession).

        "wiki": "Lu Xun Park is a park in Qingdao, Shandong, China. It is dedicated to the memory of Lu Xun, a famous writer during the May Fourth Movement.\nThe park stretches for nearly a kilometer along the Huiquan Bay. It is spread over an area of four hectares. The park is a beautiful blend of natural setting and cultural sites. Popular places like Number One Bathing Beach, Small Qingdao Island and Little Fish Hill are in the park's neighborhood.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was built in 1929. Before that, it was known as \"Ruoyu Park\" and \"Seashore Park\". It was in 1950 that it got its present name to honor Lu Xun, a leading writer in China. In October 1986, a three-meter high granite sculpture of Lu was installed at the park's entrance to mark his 50th death anniversary. In 2001, several new attractions including the Monument of Lu Xun's Autobiography, the Poetry Corridor, etc.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe park's main entrance is a beautiful example of craftsmanship. It is a stone archway sheathed in glazed tiles, constructed, like so many other features of the park, as a memorial. The script used to etch the park's name on the gateway is based on Lu Xun's script. Beyond the archway is a captivating world of pine woods, rugged reefs, exquisite pavilions and sea dogs. An undulating, narrow stone path weaves through this setting, providing a welcome relief to seekers of tranquility. One of the park's major highlights is the scene of the ebb and flow of the waves, the boats and birds out in the sea, and watching the moonlight fall on this enchanting park.The literary works of Lu Xun are commemorated in the park in a unique way. On a 246 feet-long corridor are carved 45 poems written by Lu Xun. On the center of the corridor is the copper embossed portrait relief of Lu Xun.The park also boasts an Underwater World. This wing comprises the Qingdao Aquarium, Qingdao Specimen Hall, South Pole Hall, Freshwater Fish Hall and Endangered Species Hall.\nThe park opens from 7:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. The admission is free.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. (simplified Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u5564\u9152\u5382; traditional Chinese: \u9752\u5cf6\u5564\u9152\u5ee0; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo P\u00edji\u01d4ch\u01ceng) is China's second largest brewery, with about 15% of domestic market share. It was founded in 1903 by German settlers in Qingdao, Shandong province. Its logo displays an image of Zhanqiao, a pier on Qingdao's southern shore.\n\n\n== History ==\nTsingtao Brewery was founded by the Anglo-German Brewery Co. Ltd., an English-German joint stock company based in Hong Kong which owned it until 1916. The brewery was founded on August 15, 1903 as the Germania-Brauerei (Germania Brewery) with a paid-in capital of 400,000 Mexican silver dollars divided into 4,000 shares priced at $100 each.\nFounding members of the Supervisory BoardJohn Prentice, of SC Farnham, Boyd & Co., Ltd., Shanghai\nAlexander McLeod, of Gibb, Livingston & Co., Shanghai\nC. W. Wrightson, of Fearon, Daniel & Co., Shanghai\nMax Slevogt, of Slevogt & Co., Shanghai\nJ. J\u00fcrgen Block, of H. Sietas & Co., QufuBrewery DirectorsHeinrich Seifart (1904 \u2013 25.11.1907)\nErnst Siemssen (Nov. 1907 \u2013 1914)BrewmastersR. Schuster (1904\u201305)\nMartin Wehle (1906\u201314)The first beer was served on December 22, 1904.On August 16, 1916 an extraordinary general meeting was held in Shanghai. Liquidators were appointed and it was decided the company would be sold to the Dai-Nippon Brewery (\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u9ea6\u9152, which in 1949 was split into Asahi Breweries and what later became Sapporo Brewery). The Japanese military administration in Tsingtao approved the liquidation on September 9, 1916. German equity was approximately 70 percent. The German share of the sales price attributable to shareholders was in the hands of the liquidators by April 2, 1921.\n\n\n=== Nationalization ===\n\nAfter Japan's surrender to the Allies and its retreat from China, the Tsingtao Brewery was turned into a Chinese brewery under ownership of the Tsui family and supervision of the Nationalist government in Nanjing. However, this period of ownership only lasted until 1949 when, after a civil war, the People's Republic of China was founded. Shortly after, due to Communist policies, all private shares of the Tsingtao Brewery that had previously belonged to the Tsui family were confiscated and the company became a state-owned enterprise.\n\n\n=== Privatization ===\nThe company was privatized in the early 1990s and in 1993 merged with three other breweries in Qingdao and was finally renamed Tsingtao Brewery Company Limited. At one point 27% of the company was owned by Anheuser-Busch.  The company once owned several other breweries in China, some of which also produced Tsingtao Beer.\nOn January 23, 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced that it was selling 19.9% to Asahi Breweries for $667 million. The sale will make Asahi Breweries, Ltd. the second largest shareholder in Tsingtao behind only the Tsingtao Brewery Group. On May 9, 2009 Anheuser-Busch InBev sold its remaining 7% to Chinese tycoon Chen Fashu (\u9648\u53d1\u6811) for $235 million.In January 2017, Asahi Breweries announced that it would sell its 20 percent share in Tsingtao which it had owned since 2009; the value of this share of the company is estimated at US$1.1 billion.\n\n\n== Beers ==\n\nTsingtao Beer, a well-hopped standard pale lager of 4.7% abv, is the flagship brew, accounting for most of the brewery's production. An unpasteurised version is sold as Tsingtao Draft Beer.  Tsingtao Beer was long advertised as being \"brewed with mineral water from the Laoshan Spring\", which contributed to its characteristic flavor, but that now applies only to beer produced in Qingdao, and not to that produced in the company's other breweries.Originally, Tsingtao Beer was brewed in accordance with the German Reinheitsgebot (\"Purity Law\") of 1516. Therefore, the only ingredients used were water, barley, and hops. However, the recipe changed after privatization; like many other beers made in China, Tsingtao Beer contains a proportion of the less-expensive rice as an adjunct in the mash.The brewery also produces a number of other beers, mostly for the local market.  Those sometimes found outside China include Tsingtao Dark Beer (5.2% abv), and more rarely Tsingtao Spirulina Green Beer, also sold as Tsingtao Green Beer, a 4.5% abv green-coloured pilsner containing spirulina as an additive, and claimed to promote good health.  The alcohol content of export versions may vary slightly from those for the domestic market.\nLocals typically buy this famed draft brew in branded plastic bags that they then hang under street-side tables or carry it back to home. This specific phenomenon known as the \"beer takeaway\". Buying Tsingtao beer this way is even more popular than buying it by the bottle.\n\n\n== Export orientation ==\nThe beer market in China was very underdeveloped in the 1980s and the brewery was forced to concentrate on overseas markets. The Chinese economic reforms in the early 1980s facilitated exportation. However, while concentrating on international markets, the brewery also attempted to sell its beer on the domestic market and competed with other domestic brands as well as foreign brands.\nThe main export company for the brewery was the \"Good Harvest of Five Grains Corporation\" based in Hong Kong. The Good Harvest of Five Grains Corporation also tried to market the beer in Hong Kong itself and later built a wholesale network consisting of up to 300 companies.\nTsingtao Beer was introduced to the United States in 1972, and soon became the top-selling Chinese beer in the U.S. market; it has maintained this leadership within the United States ever since, despite increasing competition from other well known Chinese beer brands, Zhujiang and Yanjing. As of July 2018, distribution in the UK and Ireland is handled by C&C Group PLC. The Tsingtao brand is sold in 62 countries and regions around the world, and accounts for more than 50% of China's beer exports. According to the company's financial figures from 2010, Tsingtao saw a 6.6% year-on-year revenue increase from sales to Hong Kong and other overseas markets.\n\n\n== National marketing ==\n\nBefore the 1949 takeover by the new PRC government, the brewery had used imported raw material and water from the Laoshan mountain. With the outbreak of the Korean War and the resulting embargo of the People's Republic by the West, the brewery was forced to use domestic products, and the government encouraged peasants in Shandong to harvest the necessary raw materials (mainly hops and barley) themselves. The government used various incentives, like free seeds, to achieve this goal.\nThe brewery had previously used nationalistic marketing strategies, and after the switchover to production using only domestic material this nationalist marketing effort was increased. However, the brewery still maintained its international roots.\n\n\n=== International Beer Festival ===\nThe brewery first applied for permission for a Qingdao International Beer Festival in 1991 and received approval and support from the Qingdao municipal administration, even to the extent that the city became the main sponsor. The first festival was opened on June 23, 1991, and has been held annually ever since. The festival was named \"International Beer Festival\" to attract foreigners as well as Chinese, although the main purpose of the festival was to make the brand more popular for domestic consumers.The festival is usually held in late August and lasts for 14 days. During the festival, there are shows in the city and people enjoy many varieties of international beer instead of only Tsingtao. Nowadays the International Beer Festival is not meant simply to publicize the Tsingtao Brewery, but also to encourage the development of Qingdao's beer culture.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBeer and breweries in China\nList of Chinese companies\nHarbin Beer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTsingtao Beer web site for US\nTsingdao Brewery official website (in Chinese)\nTsingtao Beer UK",

          "The Qingdao Beer Museum is a great place for couples or older friends that are beer enthusiasts, but primarily for the tasting of fresh, unfiltered beer near the end of the tour. It really is quite good. There is quite a bit of fascinating history from the German occupation of",

          "For those who come for the history; keep in mind Tsingdao Beer & Qingdao Brewery are owned and operated by the Chinese Government, as a State Owned Enterprise (SOE) since 1949. Therefore, there is nothing German about the beer, except its establishment in 1903 to 1914. However,",
          "Loved the beer museum. Unless you're really into beer, the museum part isn't that interesting. Instead, make a bee-line to the drinking areas. First stop is a complimentary tasting of unpasteurized beer. Then comes the assembly line, which is quite mesmerizing. Afterwards, the",

          "The price of the ticket was 60 RMB and it included 2 glasses of beer, that were excellent. Not very happy with the quality of the items in the gift shop (a bit expensive and the quality can be better). However, if you are in Qingdao, its a nice way to spend 1-2 hours",
          "Highly recommended. We took the VIP tour, and it included an English speaking guide, a special edition Tsingtao beer, private label beer with our picture on it and... a lot of beers to drink at the end. Great facility!",

          "Its a small idea for Tsingtao to open its door and offer the general public a peek into the making of the Beer process, as well as the history of Tsingtao Beer. The tour starts in Building A, all about TsingTao Beer's history, and then, onward to Building B, which shows the",
          "We had a guided tour in English through the museum and at the end you get a free beer with beer nuts. Nice experience in qingdao!",

          "We had a good time here. There are a lot of small exhibits, many with English translations. Like most things in China, the relatively newly refurbished museum is already looking run-down. Many of the little video games were very cheaply made or inoperable. The free tastes of",

          "Worth a visit - museum was interesting and the price was very reasonable. You get to see all aspects of the factory etc. Part of the tour you get to taste the beer or pay minimum extra and you get an hour afterwards - well worth the price Good location - restaurants out side",
          "Excellent journey through the history of Tsingtao beer and Qingdao. Very well preserved and super well presented, mixing the old with the new. A must for all ages, but probably not suitable for anyone with mobilty challenges as there are a lot of steps, levels, confined spaces,",

          "The cost of admission is 60 rmb and get's you a 0.15 L glass of raw beer and a 0.15L glass of Tsing Tao draft beer. There is a long history with this company stretching back to 1903 when it was co-founded by the Germans. There is a lot of english written throughout the museum",
          "The size and history was more than I expected. There is a lot of German history involved in not just the whole town, but the brewery itself. Not to be missed while in Qingdao, weather a beer drinker or not. Just be sure to be careful of the restaurants outside of the museum.",
          "Very well orginized. The visit on this museum is a mix of travel to the past...when the german way of brewwas introduced in china and a nowadays beer fabrication. You will have the chance to know both sides...the historical and the actual production. In the middle of visit they",

          "This museum is worth a visit, if only because it's one of the few attractions of its kind in Qingdao, but it's a little light on education - several of the rooms/exhibits seemed like they were purely for marketing purposes (like the room filled with pictures of famous people",
          "You're going to think I'm exaggerating, but this was by far one of my favorite attractions in China (I visited Beijing and Qingdao). Tsingdao brewery was established by the first wave of modern colonial forces, then taken over by the second, then maintained as a powerful",
          "This is a fun visit, and gives an interesting way of learning about the city's past, through the story of the beer factory. Good exhibit on how beer is made, with walk through of a modern brewery. Plus, at the end, be sure to get the beer bottle with your picture on it!",
          "The tour is really nice and interesting! very impressing to see how this brand developped and how the beer has been produced and how the process changed. Great to try the fresh one day beer and the one week beer to compare!",
          "China is full of some of the most magnificent attractions in the world. Unfortunately, none of them are in Qingdao. The Beer Museum is OK for what it is, and is well worth visiting if you are already in Qingdao, but that is mainly because Qingdao doesn't have too many other",
          "My review is mainly based on the fact that this is somehow rated the #1 thing to do in Qingdao on this site. It's kind of cool, but there are so many better things to do. The area is quite interesting though and there are a few things to do nearby.",
          "Well presented and explained historical and processes, for an easy self tour. Can do quickly or can take time.You also see part of the functioning current brewery. Two free raw beers and end up in brewery bar and gift shop area. Then when finished go and enjoy Beer Street!!",

          "The museum shows how your beer is made. I am never a friend of beer but it's good to know the way it is produced. It's like an experience to a vineyard. Not bad. We love the idea of making our own beer. Only the label though. It costs you only 35 bucks. Very nice price for a",
          "This is a must if you are in Qingdao as well as the Beer Street. Both are at the same place. Museum is well done and pleasant to see.",
          "The history of the famous Tsingtao brew and modern bottling operation outlined at the Museum was informative, albeit a little old fashioned. Time for a multi-media uplift.",
          "This museum gives a little about the history of the famous beer made here (and elsewhere in the district I believe) - it has an interesting German past... the tour is quite quick and leads to a tasting hall and gift shop. I have been here before (2008) and think I was more",

          "This is not only an interesting insight into one of the most popular Chinese beers but also a history lesson of the growth of this company along with China itself. A self guided tour will cost you 60 RMB and it's completely worth the price which will include two small drafts",

It also co-stars Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei, who previously starred in Jay Chou's Secret. The movie was filmed in Qingdao at the Qingdao Polar Ocean World and received promotion from the Qingdao council.\nIt was announced that it was to be released in spring 2010, but the release date was pushed back to 24 June 2010, which opened the 2010 Shanghai International Film Festival on 2 June.

Sam has single-handedly brought up his son since his wife died in a swimming accident 14 years ago and looks after him day and night. Upon discovering Sam has less than five months to live, he multiplies his efforts to help Dafu learn basic tasks in order to care for himself, as well as searching for a home for him, before he passes away. As the story progresses, the growing relationship between father and son, as well as the community around them, become clearer. Ling ling (Gwei Lun-mei) plays the role of a clown who is part of a small traveling circus (they perform in the aquarium for a short period of time) and who gets on well with Dafu, leading to a close friendship between them.\nThough Dafu struggles to learn many basic tasks, Sam perseveres in teaching his son the tasks that he will need to know how to perform himself once his father dies. Though Sam never gave up teaching and explaining things to Dafu in a positive and supportive and memorable manner, he did contemplate ending his and Dafu's existence together rather than leave his child to suffer without him. Sam, at this point had yet to tell anyone how far his health had deteriorated, until one day while returning from their hometown, his neighbor tells Sam his doctor came from the city with bags of free medicine and waited two hours for him. Meanwhile, Principal Liu, of the boarding school for mentally challenged children that Dafu attended as a child, recommends Dafu to a newly opened institution where he can stay after his father dies.\nDafu continues learning, though Sam must move into the institution with him to help him adjust. Ling Ling, knowing that she is about to have to leave with her circus, teaches Dafu to pick up the phone in the aquarium when he hears it, and she will talk to him.\nLing Ling leaves with her circus. Sam, for the first time in the movie, swims in the aquarium with his son, dressed in a sea turtle costume he made by hand, telling his son not to be afraid when he is gone; he will be like the turtles in the aquarium, always swimming close by with him. He almost drowns but is helped from water by Mr. Tang and while they chat, Sam reveals his wife's death might not have been an accident as she was a very good swimmer and they had recently found out Dafu is autistic. Sam doesn't blame her for not being able to handle their son's circumstances. There was only one instance in which Sam loses his composure with Dafu, while he is nearing the end, and still working and trying to teach his son how to do his job, Dafu is distracted and Sam yells at him. Less than a moment later and Sam is already mending fences and reassuring his son.\nSam eventually dies, and his funeral is attended by close friends and family. Dafu waves good bye to the sky/Sam, as it seems he has learned people live there, something Ling Ling explained to him earlier when she spoke of her grandmother with him before she left town. After the funeral, Dafu is seen doing some of the things that his father struggled so much to teach him with success. He cooks by himself, knows how to ride the bus, and picks up the phone when Ling Ling calls, and working at the ocean park, a place Mr. has opened the doors for Dafu at any time of the day. It is implied that from then on, Dafu will know how to lead his life on his own, though he still has Sam's old friends helping him along the way.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJet Li as Sam Wong / Wang Xincheng\nWen Zhang as David / Dafu\nGwei Lun-mei as Ling\nZhu Yuanyuan as Madam Chai\nDong Yong as Director Tang\nGao Yuanyuan as Sam Wong's deceased wife/Dafu's mother\nYan Minqiu as Principal Liu\nChen Rui as Xia Ya\nAshton Chen\nCao Bingkun\nMa Zihan\n\n\n== Promotion and work ==\n\n\n=== Jet Li ===\nJet Li promoted the film by visiting the dolphins at Hong Kong's Ocean Park with a small group of adults who were intellectually challenged or had autism.Jet Li also was quoted saying \"Nowadays everyone is making blockbusters. Making a seven million Chinese yuan (1 million US dollars) movie requires a lot of sincerity\", Li told reporters in Hong Kong. \"This movie is about sincerity. It shows that in this day and age that filmmakers are willing to do something for society.\" The father's selfless love for his son touched Li, a father of four children himself: \"I cried a lot when reading the script.\"\"I hope everyone can examine what is the most important relationship in life \u2013 the relationship between parent and child\", he said. \"I met some autistic children last year when I was doing charity work. When I read the script, I cried. I hope to express gratitude to all the parents in the world through the film.\"Jet Li did not take any pay for the film.Jet Li hoped the movie will encourage people pay more attention and dedicate their compassion to charity. TIME magazine named Jet Li one of its Most Influential People this year for his work with his One Foundation. Li revealed that four or five years ago, his nephew had been diagnosed with autism. His nephew is now better, but this incident made him realize how important it is to offer attention and care to those who have been diagnosed and their families.Li admitted that it was not easy to interpret his character. Because Jet Li\u2019s father died when he was two years old, he didn\u2019t understand the concept of the word \"father\" for a long time. When he was filming The Shaolin Temple, there was a line where he had to yell b\u00e0 ba (dad), which he found himself unable to say: \"In the end, the director changed it to di\u0113 (another word for dad). I thought di\u0113  had nothing to do with me, so I could say it. It wasn\u2019t until I became a father that I clearly understood what this role of a father meant.\" Another difficulty is that Li can't swim, but he eventually swam as the story required.\n\n\n=== Wen Zhang ===\nIn order to portray this character well, Wen Zhang (playing Dafu) went swimming every day. He previously did not know how to swim, but because swimming and diving are his character\u2019s strong points, he became an expert swimmer. He also visited an autism school every day, working to understand the students\u2019 way of thinking.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nChina Movie Channel Media Awards 2010\n\nWon Best Film: Ocean Heaven\nWon Best New Director: XUE Xiaolu\nWon Best Actor: Wen Zhang\nNominated for Golden Goblet award\n\n\n== Theme songs ==\n\"Said Goodbye\" (\u8aaa\u4e86\u518d\u898b) by Jay Chou\n\"Ocean Heaven\" (\u6d77\u6d0b\u5929\u5802) by Gwei Lun-mei\nGui Lunmei \"Ocean Heaven\" composed by Joe Hisaishi\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOcean Heaven has had particularly good reviews, getting very high ratings. The film also received a 4/5 from the China Post site with a detailed and heart-felt review.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOcean Heaven at the Hong Kong Movie DataBase\nOcean Heaven on IMDb\nOcean Heaven at Rotten Tomatoes\nHong Kong Cinemagic - Ocean Heaven\nhttp://yellowcranestower.blogspot.com/2010/06/ocean-heaven-beijing-premiere.html\nhttp://hktopten.blogspot.com/2010/05/20100506-jet-lis-new-film-calls-for.html\n\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u300e\u6d77\u6d0b\u5929\u5802\u300f\u3092\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u89b3\u305f\u3044\uff01 [Japanese]",

        "wiki": "St. Michael's Cathedral (Chinese: \u5723\u5f25\u7231\u5c14\u5927\u6559\u5802; pinyin: Sh\u00e8ng M\u00ed'\u00e0i'\u011br D\u00e0ji\u00e0ot\u00e1ng; German: Kathedrale St. Michael), also called the Zhejiang Road Catholic Church (Chinese: \u6d59\u6c5f\u8def\u5929\u4e3b\u6559\u5802), is a Catholic church in Qingdao (Tsingtao), Shandong Province, China and is the seat of the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Qingdao. It is located in the oldest part of Qingdao, at 15 Zhejiang Road, on the east side of Zhongshan Road in Shinan District. Built by German missionaries, the cathedral stands at the top of a hill in the center of the old German-built part of the city. It is the largest example of Romanesque Revival architecture in the province, resembling a German cathedral of the 12th century.\nSt. Michael's Cathedral is the product of a strong German presence in Shandong Province in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the mid-19th century the European powers forcibly opened China to foreign trade. The Divine Word Missionaries built a church in the Jiaozhou Bay concession in Shandong in 1902, and in 1934 erected the cathedral, which remained nominally under their administration until 1964. In 1942 it came under the control of the Japanese Army, returning to Chinese control when the Japanese left Qingdao in 1945. In the early 1950s, all foreign missionaries, including the Bishop of Qingdao, were either imprisoned or expelled from China, and during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) the cathedral was defaced and abandoned. In 1981, it was repaired by the government and reopened for services, and in 1992 it was listed as a Provincial Historic Building by the government of Shandong Province.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter China's defeat in the First Opium War, the country was forcibly opened to foreign trade by a number of treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties. Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's concession to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.\n\n\n=== German presence in Qingdao ===\n\nIn the early 1890s, the German Empire had been considering occupying Jiaozhou Bay (\"Jiaozhou\" is romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German) for building its first naval base in East Asia in order to expand into the interior of Shandong. In 1891 the Qing government decided to make Qingdao (commonly spelled \"Tsingtao\") defensible against naval attack and began to improve the existing fortifications of the town. German naval officials observed and reported on this Chinese activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. In November 1897, the German Navy seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of ensuring that reparations were paid for the murder of two German Catholic missionaries in the province. In the spring of 1898, the German government signed a treaty that allowed the Germans to lease an area of 540 square kilometres (130,000 acres; 210 sq mi) for 99 years (or until 1997, as the British did in Hong Kong's New Territories and the French did in Kouang-Tch\u00e9ou-Wan), to construct a railway to Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, and to exploit coalfields along the railroad.The Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (Schantung Halbinsel) in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.\n\nThe cathedral was built by the Divine Word Missionaries (abbreviated \"SVD,\" from their Latin name: Societas Verbi Divini), the first German Catholic missionary society. The order was founded in 1875 \"for the propagation of the Catholic religion among pagan nations,\" at Steyl (today in the Limburg Province of the Netherlands), by German Catholic priests fleeing the Kulturkampf. The society's first mission was established in 1882 in southern Shantung, a district of more than 10 million people, which contained 158 Catholics. At the time, the area was part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Shantung, managed by Italian Franciscans, who were tasked with rebuilding the earlier Catholic mission work. However, the mission work proceeded slowly, due to insufficient personnel and resources. The southern half of the province, in particular, had been all but neglected. Consequently, it was transferred to the SVD on December 2, 1885, and became the Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung. The new Vicariate Apostolic was headquartered in Yanzhou, Shandong and headed by Bishop Johann Baptist von Anzer, SVD, who led it until November 24, 1903. By 1907, the mission numbered 35,378 Catholics and 36,367 catechumens, and by 1924, 106,000 Catholics and 44,000 catechumens. The SVD's presence in Qingdao was first recorded when the mission purchased land there in 1899 and began building a mission hall.\n\n\n=== Design and construction ===\n\nIn autumn 1898 Bishop von Anzer had Father Franz Bartels appointed as pastor in Qingdao. Bishop von Anzer also commissioned Bartels with planning and constructing the Catholic mission. Bartels initially stayed in a house that was part of a Taoist temple. Adjacent to his house he had a provisional chapel built which served as a place of worship/service for the European inhabitants of Qingdao until 1902 when a mission hall with a chapel was built. Major Kopka von Lossow, commander of the Third Sea Battalion which was stationed in Qingdao, ordered about a hundred of his men to attend services every Sunday.On a hill chosen by Bishop von Anzer, Father Bartels purchased some land on Qufu Road, having a printing house and the SVD mission hall erected in 1902. The mission hall was converted to a school in 1922, and was operating as of May 2010.\nThe Holy Ghost Convent was also built on the same hill, occupied by Franciscan sisters who worked as nurses and teachers.The cathedral's original architect (commissioned by Bishop Augustin Henninghaus) designed a three-aisled Gothic church, but the World War I conquest of Qingdao by the Japanese on November 16, 1914, put an end to the cathedral plans. The city reverted to Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China. The Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung was renamed the Vicariate Apostolic of Yanzhoufu on December 13, 1924, and on February 22, 1925, the Apostolic Prefecture of Qingdao was established from its territory, with Bishop Georg Weig, SVD, appointed prefect on March 18 of that same year. On June 14, 1928, it was elevated to a Vicariate Apostolic. When construction resumed, the original Gothic plan no longer seemed appropriate for the modern townscape of Qingdao. Father Alfred Fr\u00e4bel designed the present neo-Romanesque structure, built during the tenure of Bishop Weig, who is entombed in the cathedral.Construction began on May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German architect living in Qingdao who had already completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.Some sources state that St. Michael's Cathedral was originally named \"St. Emil's Church\". A Latin inscription over the tomb of Bishop Weig states that the cathedral was consecrated to St. Michael the Archangel in 1934. In addition, a photo taken in 1935, currently in the German Federal Archives is labeled \"St. Michaels Kirche\" (St. Michael's Church), and authoritative secondary print sources make no mention of \"St. Emil's Church\".\n\n\n=== 1938\u20131949: occupation, liberation, and civil war ===\nThe Japanese reoccupied Qingdao in January 1938. Bishop Thomas Tien Ken-sin, SVD was appointed Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao, in November 1942, as Bishop Georg Weig had died the year before. That year, the Japanese placed a large sign over the main door of the cathedral that read \"Under Management of the Japanese Army\". On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered to Allied forces, officially ending World War II, and in September 1945, Qingdao was liberated by forces of the Kuomintang, restoring the government of the Republic of China. The following year, on February 18, 1946, Bishop Tien was elevated to Cardinal, becoming the first Chinese Cardinal and to date the only SVD Cardinal. He traveled to Vatican City to accept the honor. His Vicariate Apostolic was elevated to the Diocese of Qingdao on April 11. Upon his return on May 27, he was greeted by representatives of the government of Shandong Province, who had arranged a welcome in his honor, with the United States Marine Band playing outside the main entrance of the cathedral. The Marine Band was attached to Naval Forces Western Pacific, headquartered in Qingdao at the time. During the Civil War period (1946\u20131949), missionaries in Shandong Province experienced growing tensions with the Communists, spurring one of them, Father Augustin Olbert, SVD to write:\n\nThe Reds do not slacken and will in the end remain victorious. Almost the entire province is in their hands. For the time being they still give face, but when they are firmly established, they will no doubt show us their teeth, as they are already doing in some areas. We are facing the future with much anxiety. Most missionaries are convinced that, once the Reds are in power, they will expel us all.\nFather Olbert was appointed Bishop of Qingdao two years later.On June 2, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Qingdao and both the city and Shandong Province have since been under Communist control. Bishop Tien fled to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government.\n\n\n=== 1949\u20131976: Under Mao ===\n\nSoon after the Communists assumed control, a combination of assertive nationalism and socialist ideology led to the eradication of the Western presence in China, including Western culture and products. \"The denunciation of anything Western as 'capitalist,' 'bourgeois' and representative of the 'imperialist world' reached a peak during the ideological extremism of the Korean War (1950\u20131953) when the final vestiges of the Western economic and cultural presence were eradicated.\" Missionary and Communist ambitions simply were irreconcilable and the wide ideological gap could not be bridged. The stage had been set for the Communists' catastrophic assault on the missionary enterprise during the Civil War period (1946\u20131949) and the expulsion of virtually all foreigners in the early 1950s. Foreign missionaries who were suspected of being spies were arrested. Missionary institutes funded by foreign money were closed down and all foreign missionaries expelled from China. The SVD mission was not spared this fate. In 1951, the Diocese of Qingdao's Bishop Augustin Olbert, SVD was arrested, served 22 months in prison, and was then deported to Germany in 1953. Although the cathedral was closed by the government, Bishop Olbert remained Bishop of Qingdao until his death in 1964. Native Chinese clergy were not spared the government's Marxian contempt for religion during this period. Future Bishop of Qingdao Li Mingshu was sent to prison the same year Bishop Olbert was deported, and not released from labor camps until 1968. Sweeping arrests of Chinese bishops, priests, sisters and laity did not begin, however, until 1955. Afterwards, the Catholic resistance movement, encountering mass arrests and sentences to forced labor, was forced underground. Professor Jean-Paul Wiest, Research Associate at the Centre for the Study of Religion and Chinese Society wrote: \"The witness of Bishop Gong Pinmei of Shanghai and many others who chose jail, labor camps, and even death for the sake of their faith and their loyalty to the pope would sustain countless people in the years ahead.\" By late 1957, due to the prior expulsion of foreign clergy and the subsequent imprisonment of Chinese clergy, 120 out of 145 dioceses and prefectures apostolic were without ordinaries. The Diocese of Qingdao went without an ordinary until the state-run Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association consecrated and appointed Bishop Paul Han Xirang, OFM without papal sanction in 1988.The cathedral was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1971. During this time St. Michael's Cathedral was defaced by the Red Guards. The crosses topping the twin steeples were removed by the Red Guards, with two men falling to their deaths during the removal. An account of the cathedral's defacement is translated as follows:\n\nOne day, scaffolding was tied to the church steeples. People said that the crosses would be removed. The news spread throughout the city. Numerous people watched from windows, from the streets, from the beaches, and from the mountaintops as several small, ghostlike figures climbed up to the crosses. Against the blue sky they opened a saw. It was said that by evening, two people had fallen from the tower and died on the spot. People also say that this church held one of the greatest pipe organs in China. They say that when it played, the whole city could hear its music. But this rare treasure was also destroyed by the Red Guards.\nThe next morning, seeing the towers of the church, the steeple had been denuded, and the towers were bald, like the shaved heads of criminals. The onlookers felt extremely uncomfortable, as if the whole area had been corrupted; made evil. Not long after that, I occasionally passed by the church and was astonished to see the topped crosses: what originally appeared to be two thin needles [when viewed from the towers] was actually the size of two coarse, heavy men, one taller than the other. Since then, the cathedral has become a warehouse. The original crosses were rescued by local Catholics and buried in the hills. The 2400-pipe organ destroyed by the Red Guards had been one of the two largest in Asia.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nThe Chinese government subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a \"preliminary assessment\" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \"an appalling catastrophe\" and \"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\" The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that \"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \"cultural revolution\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\"The change in prevailing political views was favorable to St. Michael's Cathedral; the Chinese government funded the cathedral's restoration efforts. New crosses were manufactured for the cathedral's restoration, and \"after several years of repair, [the cathedral] was re-opened in April 1981\" for religious services. In May 1999 the church was opened to the general public, allowing entry when Mass or other services are not being celebrated. In 2005, city workers repairing water pipes accidentally found the original crosses buried on Longshan Road, not far from the cathedral. They are currently stored in the north transept. The cathedral has been listed on the register of Provincial Historic Buildings by the government of Shandong Province since 1992.The change in prevailing political views also allowed for rapprochement with Chinese clergy formerly imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. In 1985 Li Mingshu was allowed an official post teaching at the seminary of Jinan. In 1994 he was transferred to the service of the Diocese of Qingdao, and was appointed the Bishop of Qingdao in 2000. Upon his consecration as Bishop, he took the name \"Joseph\".\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Exterior and plan ===\n\nThe cathedral stands atop a hill in the center of what was the original settlement of the city of Qingdao, at 15 Zhejiang Road (formerly Bremen Strasse) on the east side of Zhongshan Road in Shinan District. The church is built in the historic style of German Romanesque. It is cruciform in plan, having a nave flanked by a lower single aisle on either side, crossed by a transept, and with a semi-circular apse projecting at the east end.\nThe cathedral is 65.9 metres (216 ft) long and the transept is 37.6 metres (123 ft) wide, with an exterior height of 18 metres (59 ft). The towers are 56 metres (184 ft) in height, and have Rhenish helm spires, each topped by a 4.5-metre (15 ft) cross. One tower contains a single large bell, and the other three smaller bells.The west front rises to a balustrade between the towers at 30 metres (98 ft). It has three portals, with a rose window above the central one. The building materials are reinforced concrete and granite, and the roofs are red tiles.\nIn his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten writes of the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral is far too large for the scale of Qingdao. Its position on top of a hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46 metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China \u2013 Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nThe total floor area of St. Michael's Cathedral is 2,740 square metres (29,500 sq ft). While the exterior of the cathedral is neo-Romanesque, the interior has piers and arches of a Classical revival style. Above the 12-metre (39 ft) high nave and transept is an unvaulted coffered ceiling. Narrow vaults over the two aisles are so much lower than the nave that they function like ambulatories. The nave can hold 1,000 people. The baptismal font and statues have captions in English and Chinese.The nave extends into a high vaulted apse (pictured right) at the east end. The aisles on either side of the nave are continued around the apse, making an ambulatory. Seven chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling over the main aisle. Beneath the chancel arch stands the high altar, under an ornate baldachin. The ciborium over the high altar bears the Latin words Venite Adoremus Dominum, \"Come adore the Lord.\" Within the sanctuary stands a second, portable, altar, upon which most masses are celebrated.\nAccording to Lonely Planet, \"The interior is splendid, with white walls, gold piping \u2026 and a marvellously painted apse.\"\n\nThe mural painted on the dome of the apse (pictured right) depicts Jesus seated on a cloud, red and golden rays radiating out of his golden halo. God the Father, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, looks down from a cloud above Jesus. A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.In 2006, the construction and installation of a massive 12-by-12-metre (39 ft \u00d7 39 ft) J\u00e4ger & Brommer pipe organ (pictured at left) was commissioned for St. Michael's Cathedral at a cost of 700,000 euros, to be ready in time for the 2008 Olympics. The pipe organ sits upon the choir loft over the west front entrance.The north transept contains three large murals featuring Jesus Christ: Jesus washing St. Peter's feet, the Sacred Heart, and the Piet\u00e0. The north transept also contains the tombs of two bishops. One is of the first Vicar Apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao, Bishop Georg Weig, SVD who supervised the construction of the cathedral. Bishop Weig's tombstone shows obvious signs of defacement, being chipped around the edges, and with broken stonework at its base. The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang, OFM, the rest having been buried in his hometown, Han Village, Yucheng County, Shandong Province.\nThe south transept also contains three large murals: the Holy child praying, St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux (patroness of missions), and the Nativity. The north and south arms of the transept each contain two altars.\n\n\n== Services ==\nThe church is active and as of 2008 more than 10,000 Catholics in Qingdao attend services there. According to December 2009 and January 2010 church bulletins, mass is celebrated daily by Bishop Li Mingshu at 6 am, with additional masses on Sunday and festivals on Easter and Christmas. Services are held in Korean and Chinese, with one Korean and several Chinese priests on site.\n\n\n== Ordinaries ==\n\nBelow is a list of bishops who have reigned from St. Michael's Cathedral, since its consecration in 1934.\n\nGeorg Weig, SVD \u2020 (Appointed 18 March 1925 \u2013 Died 3 October 1941)\nThomas Tien Ken-sin (Tienchensing), SVD \u2020 (Appointed 10 November 1942 \u2013 11 April 1946 Appointed Archbishop of Peking)\nFaustino M.

          "It is very intriguing to see a church in China without going inside. It has a very large space outside where almost all local weddings take photos. You can always notice that brides and grooms come and go to take wedding photos outside. Once I was there, 12 couples were there.",
          "The church itself is interesting and unusual, but my family loved seeing all the brides and grooms taking photos out in front of the church. My 3-year-old daughter loved so many of the dresses and asked to take a few photos with some of the brides who were all very sweet about",

          "The church is situated in lovely part of the old town with much german architecure. Its pretty cheap to go in. We were surprised at the simplicity of the inside. Much of the side alters were dedicated to the most famous Saints. After the visit stroll back down the city streets",
          "Popped in for a short visit - absolutely amazed at how many wedding pictures were being taken in the square. Worth the visit just to see it. Never went inside ( no time), but beautiful on the outside. You will need to park some way away and walk. This was a difficult place to",
          "This place feels like a mini slice of Germany inside China, and it's austere architecture, combined with the surrounding cobblestone square, really feels somewhat surreal. But this is best experienced for free, outside the church. This was one of my favorite parts of Qingdao,",

          "A very strange place. We didn't go inside the Church, instead we just took photos of the staggaring amount of Chinese couples out taking wedding photos. If you are the kind of person who enjoys such things it would also be a fantastic place for photobombing! The building itself",

          "If you are getting married in Qingdao, you will probably have your pictures taken here. Lots of couples come here to have their pictures taken, along with tourists and those with dogs wearing tiny shoes. Not the most authentic experience in Qingdao, but worth the visit.",

It is located on the southern side of Zhanshan (literally 'clear' or 'deep mountain'), facing the sea.\nThe monastery was built in 1945 and is an active, functional Buddhist sanctuary. Apart from the Stupa and the Olympic Mascot Bell Tower, located on the right-hand side of the grounds, the remaining buildings are situated in a rectangular format. To the right of the entry portal is one of the several Buddhist scripture shops. Here, incense sticks and other Buddhist supplies are available for purchase. Adjacent the scripture shop is a Bell Tower (zhonglou; \u949f\u697c) with the first of many statues of Buddha. At the right of the entry is the Drum Tower (gulou; \u9f13\u697c) with another Buddha.\nReturning to the central path, directly ahead is the Heavenly King Hall (tianwang dian; \u5929\u738b\u6bbf). The large Buddha, which is the focal point of this shrine, is flanked by four large statues, one depicting a pipa player. Directly behind Heavenly King Hall is the larger Hall of Sakyamuni (\u5927\u96c4\u5b9d\u6bbf), which honors the founder of Buddhism, the son of a king of the Sakya clan of the Kshatriya (i.e., warriors). His given name was Siddhartha, his family name, Gautama. The epithet \u201cSakyamuni\u201d means \u201csage of the Sakyas.\u201d In this magnificent hall, a large, central Buddha is flanked by two smaller statues, each attended by eight priests. This hall is an active place of prayer equipped with cushions for kneeling, candles for lighting incense, and other Buddhist prayer supplies.\nBehind the Hall of Sakyamuni is the Hall of Three Saints (san sheng dian; \u4e09\u5723\u6bbf). In the center of the hall are three large, gilded statues, each about twelve feet in height.\nContinuing along the central path, the next building is the Preaching Hall (shengtang; \u5723\u5802). To the left of Preaching Hall is the Hall of the Recumbent Buddha (wo fo dian; \u5367\u4f5b\u6bbf), where, behind a long, gilded altar, a gilded, bejeweled statue of Buddha stretches out almost twenty feet in length.\nOpposite the Hall of the Recumbent Buddha is the Shandong Zhanshan Buddhist College (Shandong Zhanshan Fo xue yuan; \u5c71\u4e1c\u6e5b\u5c71\u4f5b\u5b66\u9662). To the right of the Hall of the Recumbent Buddha is the headquarters of the Qingdao Buddhist Association, Tiantai sect, (Qingdao fojiao xiehui; \u9752\u5c9b\u5e02\u4f5b\u6559\u534f\u4f1a). Exiting the monastery grounds, one passes the Olympic Mascot Bell (ao yun jixiang zhong; \u5965\u8fd0\u5409\u7965\u949f)The view from the top of this bell tower is panoramic; however, there is an additional fee of 10 \u5143 to see that view.\nThe 8 April of the lunar calendar is traditionally observed as the birthday of the Buddha. On that day, thousands of Buddhists flock to the monastery grounds to attend religious events.\nIn 2004 a major renovation was initiated. As of June 2009, the renovation remains in progress.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReligion in China",

          "German buildings in the middle of China - great architecture. Easy to get there as its in a busy tourist area of Qingdao.",
          "A great pice of colonial history of China, Mao and other notables also stayed here when it became a guest house .Original Period furniture from Germany throughout the house.",
          "A must to hire a care or a taxi to drive you through the historical streets, It is the number one high light of my trip to Qingdao",
          "Correct museum. It covers both the history of the brewery and the beer making process. Good information panels in English",
          "Good in terms of its history and influential people stayed there. Not as grand as many European castles, but still a beautiful German style mansion to see.",
          "definately worth the trip/walk up to see. The history of German occupation is very important to this town, and it is very well preserved.",
          "The Governor's house is a nice building and one of quite a few remarkable German style houses in Qingdao. There isn't too much to see inside except an exhibition of photos but walking through a building like this is always a nice trip in modern day China.",
          "Old mansions built by the Germaans in the early last century. Interesting to see. Old mansion of dio Xio Ping in worthwhile seeing",
          "I love this place and take all my visitors. It is a little piece of Germany built for the German governor of Qingdao and later kept up by Chairman Mao as a holiday house. Lots of historic photos in the conservatory - original furnishings and fittings. A lovely restaurant in",
          "The Germans were only in Qingdao for seven years, but left their mark on Qingdao architecture (even recent buildings) and of course beverages. We were told by Chinese family and friends that the reason these buildings were not destroyed was because they were all occupied by",
          "This former governor's mansion is an amazing anachronism-- a high-style German Arts-and-Crafts style building transplanted to China! Much original furniture remains and the overall impression is that the Europeans lived pretty high off the Chinese!",
          "This old structure has been remarkably preserved/restored. It is marked contrast to Modern Qingdao, Strolling through it and looking at all the fuirnishings and photos displayed you gain a sense of what it was like to be a German official in late 19th and early 20th century",
          "This wonderful building is well worth the visit. Its great to see some German culture in a Chinese city. You can really see that it was made for the governor.",
          "Visited in early September which is shoulder season, between summer and Mid Autumn and China National Day (10/1) so very quiet and no crowds. Was surprised by 20RMB admission, but once inside I thought worth it. Most of the explanation is in Chinese sadly which is a bit rough",
          "This beautifully maintained building provides a good overview of the benefits Qingdao gained from the Germans and the prominence of this venue since that time.",
          "It's a great looking mansion on the outside and there is plenty of original furniture and history to make the inside interesting. I'll bet the governer of Qingdao and all the chinese party officials that stayed here were quite content with their little palace on the hill.",
          "The Governor's Residence is minimally changed since its previous owners under Chinese rule. Little furniture remains, but a few specific pieces used by former Chairman Mao. Many labels are in Chinese, but a few describe rooms in English. The view of the bay is more blocked by",
          "Our Qingdao hosts took us to visit the Governor's Residence. I was surprised and amazed at the German architecture in the middle of a Chinese city. The Residence is a very beautiful building, with quite a history. The inside tour is very interesting, but I really wish that",
          "It is situated in the centre of Qingdao's historical area and was designed by a famous German Architect. It and the gardens are facscinating on their own. It houses many artefacts and photographs about its history. Later on it became a guest house and Chairman Mao Zedong",
          "The exterior is typically German/Bavarian, but stepping inside you see a mixture of two cultures in the architecture and furniture. The woodwork is big, chunky European, mixed with Chinese and European furniture of the time. It makes a wonderful blend. We spent about an hour",
          "This is a most attractive historic tourist spot with all the trappings of opulence and colonial indulgence. The outside is even better than the inside which looked a little timeworn during my visit, but still you can really feel what it was like to live in such a place during",
          "It looks like the governor just popped out to get a newspaper \u2013 the house is that intact.

          "This building is truly beautiful, it is amazing to see this kind of architecture in China! The building is not so big, all can be seen in less than an hour. One should pay attention to all the old fire places, the wall reliefs, they are oozing with the old charm of the Belle",

        "wiki": "Qingdao University of Science and Technology (simplified Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b66; traditional Chinese: \u9752\u5cf6\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b78; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo K\u0113j\u00ec D\u00e0xu\u00e9, acronym QUST) is a university located in Qingdao, China, colloquially known as Qingkeda (\u9752\u79d1\u5927). Having evolved from a college specializing in the chemical industry, it is now a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary university offering academic degrees in Science, Technology, Humanities, Business, Management, Medicine, Law and Arts. The school encompasses three campuses in Sifang and Laoshan districts of Qingdao and Gaomi district of Weifang.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the university lies in the Shenyang Light Industry Vocational School (\u6c88\u9633\u8f7b\u5de5\u4e1a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u804c\u4e1a\u5b66\u6821) which was founded in 1950. For that purpose, the government of the Northeast Region choose to put the premises of the Shenyang Wenhui Middle School (\u6c88\u9633\u6587\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5b66), a catholic school operating since 1876, to new use. Since being run by the Christian Church meant that the Wenhui School had soon to close, an agreement was reached beforehand in order to ensure the transition of both the teaching staff and the students. In accordance with the economic needs of the time, chemistry, paper making and rubber production made up the core curriculum for the higher education branch, while the former middle school continued its operation under the auspices of this new institution. The first three vocational classes enrolled in October 1950, numbering 128 students in total.\nThe school didn't remain in Shenyang for long. In December 1954, the Ministry of Light Industry decided to move the whole institution to Qingdao, where more expertise was needed to further the development of the local rubber-industry. Thus, in September 1956 the Qingdao Rubber Industry School (\u9752\u5c9b\u6a61\u80f6\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b66\u6821) opened its gates, having moved teachers, students and equipment from Liaoning to Shandong Province. During those years, the area lay at the outskirts of the city proper and was far from being urbanized. In 1958, under the name Shandong College of Chemical Industry (\u5c71\u4e1c\u5316\u5de5\u5b66\u9662), it became directly subordinated to the Ministry of Chemical Industry and given the right to award bachelor's degrees. During the Cultural Revolution, the college suffered a sharp decline in the range of subjects to only three, namely Rubber Machinery, Chemical Machinery and Rubber Products, in 1968. The length of studies was also shortened to only two years, and in 1972, it was required for the school to recruit workers, peasants and soldiers as students (\u5de5\u519c\u5175\u5b66\u5458). Things started to look brighter in 1977, when the Gaokao was reinstated as prerequisite to higher education, and the college was able to enroll 443 new students for Bachelor-level studies.\nThe right to recruit student for master's degrees in technical fields was awarded in 1980. Distance education was introduced in 1981, starting with 91 students at the time. Since 1985 the college was called Qingdao Institute of Chemical Industry (\u9752\u5c9b\u5316\u5de5\u5b66\u9662), a change of name that was considered a downgrade by a lot of students and teachers alike and thus not warmly welcomed. Contrary to the reservations expressed at the time, it didn't harm the institutions further development of the institution. On the contrary was the range of subjects steadily expanded in the following decades, including the expansion from three to six faculties, including Foreign Languages and Computer Sciences, in 1993, bringing the number of students close to 3,963 and the number of bachelor courses to 17. Another big step towards a comprehensive university was done with the incorporation of the Qingdao Arts and Crafts School (\u9752\u5c9b\u5de5\u827a\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u6821) in 2001. That same year, the number of students reached 10,747. The biggest change and expansion yet followed in 2002, when full university status was granted and the school adopted its current and final name, Qingdao University of Science and Technology. In September 2002, the new campus in Laoshan was inaugurated. In 2006, the College of Communication and Animation was opened and several language majors added to the School of Foreign Languages. A third campus was opened in 2009 in Gaomi, marking the expansion of the university beyond the borders of Qingdao. The establishment of a Middle School Affiliated to Qingdao University of Science and Technology in Laoshan district (\u9752\u5c9b\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u5b66\u6821) commenced in 2014.\n\n\n== Academics ==\nQingdao University of Science and Technology is one of the nine Provincial Key Universities of Shandong (\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u5c5e\u91cd\u70b9\u9ad8\u6821). It was ranked 45th among engineering universities on the Mainland in 2013. In 2011, it was included in the first national Excellence Plan for Engineering Education (\u5353\u8d8a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6559\u80b2\u57f9\u517b\u8ba1\u5212). The three campuses together cover an area of 700,000 m2. The total value of fixed assets is estimated at 2,200 billion yuan. Spread over five branches, the foundation of the University Library dates back to 1950. It now covers a building area of around 50,000m2 and contains over 2.4 million volumes, including digital ones.\nThe university offers three first level and 22 second level doctoral programs and four postdoctoral research stations, 20 first level and 125 second level master programs and 68 undergraduate programs. Chemistry and materials science are the most renowned majors offered, with the Key Laboratory of Rubber-plastics as well as the Key Laboratory of Eco-chemical Engineering of the Ministry of Education being hosted by the university. Several post-doctoral programs in those fields are also available. Joint research centers have been set up with several international companies, including the LANXESS Rubber Research Center Qingdao.\nFive majors are accredited as being distinguished on a national level (\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7\u7279\u8272\u4e13\u4e1a), those include:\n\nChemical Engineering and Technology\nApplied Chemistry\nPolymer Materials and Engineering\nMechanical Engineering and Automation,\nProcess Equipment and Control EngineeringThe aforementioned as well as the following majors are accredited as being distinguished on a provincial level (\u7701\u7ea7\u54c1\u724c\u7279\u8272\u4e13\u4e1a):\n\nMaterials Chemistry\nAutomation\nElectronic Information Engineering\nBusiness Administration\nEnglish Language StudiesThe university is an official test center for the TOEIC and the Italian language CELI exam.\n\n\n=== Sifang Campus ===\n\nThe oldest campus of the university is located in Sifang district near the eastern end of Jiaozhou Bay Bridge. It is renowned for its beautiful main building, which was built in 1956 and inspired by the soviet architecture of the time. Most majors that form the core profile of the university are still based in Sifang. A large cluster of high-end chemical and rubber industries, the so-called Rubber Valley (\u6a61\u80f6\u8c37), is located adjacent to the campus, as is the science park of the university.\n\nCollege of Chemical Engineering \u5316\u5de5\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering \u5316\u5b66\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\nSchool of Polymer Science and Engineering \u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Materials Science and Engineering \u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Environment and Safety Engineering \u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Adult Vocational Education \u6210\u6559\u5b66\u9662\u9ad8\u804c\u5b66\u9662\n\n\n=== Laoshan Campus ===\n\nThe biggest in area campus was inaugurated in 2002. It is located in near many tourist hotspots, including Mount Lao (Lauschan) (\u5d02\u5c71) and the Shilaoren Beach (\u77f3\u8001\u4eba\u6d77\u6c34\u6d74\u573a). In addition to the faculties that were added as part of the transition into a comprehensive university, Laoshan Campus also includes the main administration and library. While construction of the southern part of the campus, called Nanyuan (\u5357\u82d1), was already finished in the years following its inauguration, the campus district of Beiyuan (\u5317\u82d1) was opened in 2012 and is still being expanded.\n\nCollege of Electromechanical Engineering \u673a\u7535\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Mathematics \u6570\u7406\u5b66\u9662\nSchool of Information Sciences and Technology \u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u5b66\u9662\nSchool of Foreign Languages \u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Economics and Management \u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of the Arts \u827a\u672f\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Communication and Animation \u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u52a8\u6f2b\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Marxism \u9a6c\u514b\u601d\u4e3b\u4e49\u5b66\u9662\nLaw School \u653f\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\nDepartment of Sports \u4f53\u80b2\u6559\u5b66\u90e8\nSino-German Technology College \u4e2d\u5fb7\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of International Cooperation \u56fd\u9645\u5408\u4f5c\u5b66\u9662\nCollege of Automation and Electronic Engineering \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\n\n\n=== Gaomi Campus ===\nSeveral branches of the main faculties are located at Gaomi Campus, with most majors offered in Economics, Chemical and Computer sciences. The courses for Associates degree level of studies are also based here, with 22 majors offered in total. 4,000 students are enrolled and 260 teacher employed in Gaomi. Same as in Laoshan, this campus is also undergoing further construction.\n\nQingdao University of Science and Technology, Gaomi Campus \u9752\u5c9b\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b66\u9ad8\u5bc6\u6821\u533a\n\n\n=== International cooperation ===\n\nQingdao University of Science and Technology has a strong partnership with the University of Paderborn, Germany, that has resulted in the establishment of the Sino-German Technology College on Laoshan Campus. Students who pass the requirements set by the universities and the DAAD can finish their Bachelor-studies in several German universities and have the opportunity to do a master's degree there.

        "wiki": "Lu Xun Park is a park in Qingdao, Shandong, China. It is dedicated to the memory of Lu Xun, a famous writer during the May Fourth Movement.\nThe park stretches for nearly a kilometer along the Huiquan Bay. It is spread over an area of four hectares. The park is a beautiful blend of natural setting and cultural sites. Popular places like Number One Bathing Beach, Small Qingdao Island and Little Fish Hill are in the park's neighborhood.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was built in 1929. Before that, it was known as \"Ruoyu Park\" and \"Seashore Park\". It was in 1950 that it got its present name to honor Lu Xun, a leading writer in China. In October 1986, a three-meter high granite sculpture of Lu was installed at the park's entrance to mark his 50th death anniversary. In 2001, several new attractions including the Monument of Lu Xun's Autobiography, the Poetry Corridor, etc.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe park's main entrance is a beautiful example of craftsmanship. It is a stone archway sheathed in glazed tiles, constructed, like so many other features of the park, as a memorial. The script used to etch the park's name on the gateway is based on Lu Xun's script. Beyond the archway is a captivating world of pine woods, rugged reefs, exquisite pavilions and sea dogs. An undulating, narrow stone path weaves through this setting, providing a welcome relief to seekers of tranquility. One of the park's major highlights is the scene of the ebb and flow of the waves, the boats and birds out in the sea, and watching the moonlight fall on this enchanting park.The literary works of Lu Xun are commemorated in the park in a unique way. On a 246 feet-long corridor are carved 45 poems written by Lu Xun. On the center of the corridor is the copper embossed portrait relief of Lu Xun.The park also boasts an Underwater World. This wing comprises the Qingdao Aquarium, Qingdao Specimen Hall, South Pole Hall, Freshwater Fish Hall and Endangered Species Hall.\nThe park opens from 7:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. The admission is free.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "What a rather nice surprise we had when we visited this gem in the sea of other Chinese attractions. While it was overpriced (by Western standards) we did see a number of species which I have not seen before (I come from a coastal town). It is a definite must-see for those",

          "We read the reviews and decided to go anyway and were positively surprised by what we saw. The only bad bit was the mammal area which was very smelly and a little dirty. The rest of the exhibits were well maintained and clean and my daughter really enjoyed the experience. We",

          "When we first walked it, it was full of exhibits and models of sea creatures , skeletons, and jars of preserved sea animals. And we almost feared that that was it, so we were relieved when we found the actual start of the aquarium. Overall, we found that it was everything as",

          "This is a mix between a traditional Western aquarium and a biology classroom full of dead things in jars with formaldehyde. Some of the things in jars are worth seeing. But you can't help but feel creeped out at the sheer volume of preserved dead things. It seems the Chinese",

          "Very nice place to see but the only comments we have is that they should make able for wheelchair and baby trollers. Having stair a bit everywhere is uncomfortable to go around. And the last thing is the toilets for kids are not available when you know that so many kids goes",

        "wiki": "The First Sino-Japanese War (25 July 1894 \u2013 17 April 1895) was a conflict between the Qing dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan primarily over influence in Joseon Korea. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.\nThe war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan's successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.\nThe war is commonly known in China as the War of Jiawu (Chinese: \u7532\u5348\u6230\u722d; pinyin: Ji\u01cew\u01d4 Zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng), referring to the year (1894) as named under the traditional sexagenary system of years. In Japan, it is called the Japan\u2013Qing War (Japanese: \u65e5\u6e05\u6226\u4e89, Hepburn: Nisshin sens\u014d). In Korea, where much of the war took place, it is called the Qing\u2013Japan War (Korean: \uccad\uc77c\uc804\uc7c1; Hanja: \u6df8\u65e5\u6230\u722d).\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter two centuries, the Japanese policy of seclusion under the sh\u014dguns of the Edo period came to an end when the country was opened to trade by the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. In the years following the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the fall of the shogunate, the newly formed Meiji government embarked on reforms to centralize and modernize Japan. The Japanese had sent delegations and students around the world to learn and assimilate Western arts and sciences, with the intention of making Japan an equal to the Western powers. These reforms transformed Japan from a feudal society into a modern industrial state.\nThe Qing Dynasty had also started to undergo reform in both military and political doctrine, but was far from successful.\n\n\n=== Korean politics ===\nIn January 1864, Cheoljong of Joseon died without a male heir, and through Korean succession protocols Gojong of Korea ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, as King Gojong was too young to rule, the new king's father, Yi Ha-\u016dng, became the Heungseon Daewongun, or lord of the great court, and ruled Korea in his son's name as regent. Originally the term Daewongun referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne. With his ascendancy to power the Daewongun initiated a set of reforms designed to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the Yangban class. He also pursued an isolationist policy and was determined to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation. In Korean history, the king's in-laws enjoyed great power, consequently the Daewongun acknowledged that any future daughters-in-law might threaten his authority. Therefore, he attempted to prevent any possible threat to his rule by selecting as a new queen for his son an orphaned girl from among the Y\u014fh\u016dng Min clan, which lacked powerful political connections. With Empress Myeongseong as his daughter-in-law and the royal consort, the Daewongun felt secure in his power. However, after she had become queen, Min recruited all her relatives and had them appointed to influential positions in the name of the king. The Queen also allied herself with political enemies of the Daewongun, so that by late 1873 she had mobilized enough influence to oust him from power. In October 1873, when the Confucian scholar Choe Ik-hyeon submitted a memorial to King Gojong urging him to rule in his own right, Queen Min seized the opportunity to force her father-in-law's retirement as regent. The departure of the Daewongun led to Korea's abandonment of its isolationist policy.\n\n\n=== Opening of Korea ===\n\nOn February 26, 1876, after confrontations between the Japanese and Koreans, the Ganghwa Treaty was signed, opening Korea to Japanese trade. In 1880, the King sent a mission to Japan that was headed by Kim Hong-jip, an enthusiastic observer of the reforms taking place there. While in Japan, the Chinese diplomat Huang Zunxian presented him with a study called \"Chaoxian Celue\" (A Strategy for Korea). It warned of the threat to Korea posed by the Russians and recommended that Korea maintain friendly relations with Japan, which was at the time too economically weak to be an immediate threat, to work closely with China, and seek an alliance with the United States as a counterweight to Russia. After returning to Korea, Kim presented the document to King Gojong, who was so impressed with the document that he had copies made and distributed to his officials.In 1880, following Chinese advice and breaking with tradition, King Gojong decided to establish diplomatic ties with the United States. After negotiations through Chinese mediation in Tianjin, the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation was formally signed between the United States and Korea in Incheon on May 22, 1882. However, there were two significant issues raised by the treaty, the first concerned Korea's status as an independent nation. During the talks with the Americans, the Chinese insisted that the treaty contain an article declaring that Korea was a dependency of China and argued that the country had long been a tributary state of China. But the Americans firmly opposed such an article, arguing that a treaty with Korea should be based on the Treaty of Ganghwa, which stipulated that Korea was an independent state. A compromise was finally reached, with Shufeldt and Li agreeing that the King of Korea would notify the U.S president in a letter that Korea had special status as a tributary state of China. The treaty between the Korean government and the United States became the model for all treaties between it and other Western countries. Korea later signed similar trade and commerce treaties with Great Britain and Germany in 1883, with Italy and Russia in 1884, and with France in 1886. Subsequently, commercial treaties were concluded with other European countries.\n\n\n=== Korean reforms ===\nAfter 1879, China's relations with Korea came under the authority of Li Hongzhang, who had emerged as one of the most influential figures in China after playing an important role during the Taiping Rebellion, and was also an advocate of the self-strengthening movement. In 1879, Li was appointed as governor-general of Zhili Province and the imperial commissioner for the northern ports. He was in charge of China's Korea policy and urged Korean officials to adopt China's own self-strengthening program to strengthen their country in response to foreign threats, to which King Gojong was receptive. The Korean government, immediately after opening of the country to the outside world, pursued a policy of enlightenment aimed at achieving national prosperity and military strength through the doctrine of tongdo s\u014fgi (Eastern ways and Western machines). To modernize their country, the Koreans tried selectively to accept and master Western technology while preserving their country's cultural values and heritage.In January 1881, the government launched administrative reforms and established the T'ongni kimu amun (Office for Extraordinary State Affairs) which was modeled on Chinese administrative structures. Under this overarching organization, 12 sa or agencies were created. In 1881, a technical mission was sent to Japan to survey its modernized facilities. Officials traveled all over Japan inspecting administrative, military, educational, and industrial facilities. In October, another small group went to Tianjin to study modern weapons manufacturing, and Chinese technicians were invited to manufacture weapons in Seoul. Additionally, as part of their plan to modernize the country, the Koreans had invited the Japanese military attach\u00e9 Lieutenant Horimoto Reiz\u014d to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army. A new military formation called the Py\u014flgigun (Special Skills Force) was established, in which eighty to one hundred young men of the aristocracy were to be given Japanese military training. The following year, in January 1882, the government also reorganized the existing five-army garrison structure into the Muwiy\u014fng (Palace Guards Garrison) and the Chang\u014fy\u014fng (Capital Guards Garrison).\n\n\n=== Japanese insecurities over Korea ===\nDuring the 1880s, discussions in Japan about national security focused on the issue of Korean reform. The political discourse over the two were interlinked, as the German military adviser Major Jacob Meckel stated, Korea was \"a dagger pointed at the heart of Japan\". What made Korea of strategic concern was not merely its proximity to Japan but its inability to defend itself against outsiders. If Korea were truly independent, it posed no strategic problem to Japan's national security but if the country remained backward and uncivilized it would remain weak and consequently would be inviting prey for foreign domination. The political consensus in Japan was that Korean independence lay, as it had been for Meiji Japan, through the importation of \"civilization\" from the West. Korea required a program of self-strengthening like the post-Restoration reforms that were enacted in Japan. The Japanese interest in the reform of Korea was not purely altruistic. Not only would these reforms enable Korea to resist foreign intrusion, which was in Japan's direct interest, but through being a conduit of change they would also have opportunity to play a larger role on the peninsula. To Meiji leaders, the issue was not whether Korea should be reformed but how these reforms might be implemented. There was a choice of adopting a passive role which required the cultivation of reformist elements within Korean society and rendering them assistance whenever possible, or adopting a more aggressive policy, actively interfering in Korean politics to assure that reform took place. Many Japanese advocates of Korean reform swung between these two positions.\nJapan in the early 1880s was weak, as a result of internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions during the previous decade. The country was also struggling financially, with inflation as a result of these internal factors. Subsequently, the Meiji government adopted a passive policy, encouraging the Korean court to follow the Japanese model but offering little concrete assistance except for the dispatch of the small military mission headed by Lieutenant Horimoto Reizo to train the Py\u014flgigun. What worried the Japanese was the Chinese, who had loosened their hold over Korea in 1876 when the Japanese succeeded in establishing a legal basis for Korean independence by ending its tributary status. Chinese actions appeared to be thwarting the forces of reform in Korea and re-asserting their influence over the country.\n\n\n=== 1882 crisis ===\n\nIn 1882, the Korean Peninsula experienced a severe drought which led to food shortages, causing much hardship and discord among the population. Korea was on the verge of bankruptcy, even falling months behind on military pay, causing deep resentment among the soldiers. There was also resentment towards the Py\u014flgigun on the part of the soldiers of the regular Korean army, as the formation was better equipped and treated. Additionally, more than 1000 soldiers had been discharged in the process of overhauling the army, most of them were either old or disabled and the rest had not been given their pay in rice for thirteen months.In June of that year, King Gojong, being informed of the situation, ordered that a month's allowance of rice be given to the soldiers. He directed Min Gyeom-ho, the overseer of government finances and the Queen Min's nephew, to handle the matter. Min in turn handed the matter over to his steward who sold the good rice he had been given and used the money to buy millet which he mixed with sand and bran. As a result, the rice became rotten and inedible. The distribution of the alleged rice infuriated the soldiers. On July 23, a military mutiny and riot broke out in Seoul. Enraged soldiers headed for the residence of Min Gyeom-ho, who they had suspected of having swindled them out of their rice. Min, on hearing word of the revolt, ordered the police to arrest some of the ringleaders and announced that they would be executed the next morning. He had assumed that this would serve as a warning to the other agitators. However, after learning what had transpired, the rioters broke into Min's house to take vengeance; as he was not at his residence the rioters vented their frustrations by destroying his furniture and other possessions.The rioters then moved on to an armory from which they stole weapons and ammunition, and then headed for the prison. After overpowering the guards, they released not only the men who had been arrested that day by Min Gyeom-ho but also many political prisoners as well. Min then summoned the army to quell the rebellion but it had become too late to suppress the mutiny. The original body of mutineers had been swelled by the poor and disaffected citizenry of the city, as a result the revolt had assumed major proportions. The rioters now turned their attention to the Japanese. One group headed to Lieutenant Horimoto's quarters and killed him. Another group, some 3,000 strong headed for the Japanese legation, where Hanabusa Yoshitada the minister to Korea and twenty seven members of the legation resided. The mob surrounded the legation shouting its intention of killing all the Japanese inside. Hanabusa gave orders to burn the legation and important documents were set on fire. As the flames quickly spread, the members of the legation escaped through a rear gate, where they fled to the harbor and boarded a boat which took them down the Han River to Chemulpo. Taking refuge with the Incheon commandant, they were again forced to flee after word arrived of the events in Seoul and the attitude of their hosts changed. They escaped to the harbor during heavy rain and were pursued by Korean soldiers. Six Japanese were killed, while another five were seriously wounded. The survivors carrying the wounded, then boarded a small boat and headed for the open sea where three days later they were rescued by a British survey ship, HMS Flying Fish, which took them to Nagasaki. The following day, after the attack on the Japanese legation, the rioters forced their way into the royal palace where they found and killed Min Gyeom-ho, as well as a dozen other high-ranking officers. They also searched for Queen Min. The queen narrowly escaped, however, dressed as an ordinary lady of the court and was carried on the back of a faithful guard who claimed she was his sister. The Daewongun used the incident to reassert his power.\nThe Chinese then deployed about 4,500 troops to Korea, under General Wu Changqing, which effectively regained control and quelled the rebellion. In response, the Japanese also sent four warships and a battalion of troops to Seoul to safeguard Japanese interests and demand reparations. However, tensions subsided with the Treaty of Chemulpo, signed on the evening of August 30, 1882. The agreement specified that the Korean conspirators would be punished and \u00a550,000 would be paid to the families of slain Japanese. The Japanese government would also receive \u00a5500,000, a formal apology, and permission to station troops at their diplomatic legation in Seoul. In the aftermath of rebellion, the Daewongun was accused of fomenting the rebellion and its violence, and was arrested by Chinese and taken to Tianjin. He was later carried off to a town about sixty miles southwest of Beijing, where for three years he was confined to one room and kept under strict surveillance.\n\n\n=== Re-assertion of Chinese influence ===\nAfter the Imo Incident, early reform efforts in Korea suffered a major setback. In the aftermath of the incident, the Chinese reasserted their influence over the peninsula, where they began to directly interfere in Korean internal affairs. After stationing troops at strategic points in the capital Seoul, the Chinese undertook several initiatives to gain significant influence over the Korean government. Two special advisers on foreign affairs representing Chinese interests were dispatched to Korea: the German Paul Georg von M\u00f6llendorff, a close confidant of Li Hongzhang, and the Chinese diplomat Ma Jianzhong. A staff of Chinese officers also took over the training of the army, providing the Koreans with 1,000 rifles, two cannons, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, the Chingunyeong (Capital Guards Command), a new Korean military formation, was created and trained along Chinese lines by Yuan Shikai.In October, the two countries signed a treaty stipulating that Korea was a dependency of China and granted Chinese merchants the right to conduct overland and maritime business freely within its borders. It also gave the Chinese substantial advantages over the Japanese and Westerners and also granted them unilateral extraterritoriality privileges in civil and criminal cases. Under the treaty the number of Chinese merchants and traders greatly increased, a severe blow to Korean merchants. Although it allowed Koreans reciprocally to trade in Beijing the agreement was not a treaty but was in effect issued as a regulation for a vassal. Additionally, during the following year, the Chinese supervised the creation of a Korean Maritime Customs Service, headed by von M\u00f6llendorff. Korea was reduced to a semi-colonial tributary state of China with King Gojong unable to appoint diplomats without Chinese approval, and with troops stationed in the country to protect Chinese interests.\n\n\n=== Factional rivalry and ascendancy of the Min clan ===\nDuring the 1880s two rival factions emerged in Korea. One was a small group of reformers that had centered around the Gaehwadang, (Enlightenment Party) which had become frustrated at the limited scale and arbitrary pace of reforms. The members who constituted the Enlightenment Party were youthful, well-educated Koreans and most were from the yangban class. They were impressed by the developments in Meiji Japan and were eager to emulate them. Its members included Kim Ok-gyun, Pak Yung-hio, Hong Yeong-sik, Seo Gwang-beom, and Soh Jaipil. The group was also relatively young; Pak Yung-hio came from a prestigious lineage related to the royal family, was 23, Hong was 29, Seo Gwang-beom was 25, and Soh Jaipil was 20; with Kim Ok-gyun being the oldest at 33. All had spent some time in Japan, Pak Yung-hio had been part of a mission sent to Japan to apologize for the Imo incident in 1882. He had been accompanied by Seo Gwang-beom and by Kim Ok-gyun, who later come under the influence of Japanese modernizers such as Fukuzawa Yukichi. Kim Ok-gyun, while studying in Japan, had also cultivated friendships with influential Japanese figures and became the de facto leader of the group. They were also strongly nationalistic and desired to make their country truly independent by ending Chinese interference in Korea's internal affairs.The Sadaedang was a group of conservatives, which included not only Min Yeong-ik from the Min family but also other prominent Korean political figures that wanted to maintain power with China's help. Although the members of the Sadaedang supported the enlightenment policy, they favored gradual changes based on the Chinese model. After the Imo incident, the Min clan pursued a pro-Chinese policy. This was also partly a matter of opportunism as the intervention by Chinese troops led to subsequent exile of the rival Daewongun in Tianjin and the expansion of Chinese influence in Korea, but it also reflected an ideological disposition also shared by many Koreans toward the more comfortable and traditional relationship as a tributary of China. Consequently, the Min clan became advocates of the \"dongdo seogi\" (Adopting Western knowledge while keeping Eastern values) philosophy, this had originated from the ideas of moderate Chinese reformers who had emphasized the need to maintain the perceived superior cultural values and heritage of the Sino-centric world while recognizing the importance of acquiring and adopting Western technology, particularly military technology, in order to preserve autonomy. Hence, rather than the major institutional reforms such as the adaptation of new values such as legal equality or introducing modern education like in Meiji Japan, the advocates of this school of thought sought piecemeal adoptions of institutions that would strengthen the state while preserving the basic social, political, and cultural order. Through the ascendancy of Queen Min to the throne, the Min clan had also been able to use the newly created institutions by the government as bases for political power, subsequently with their growing monopoly of key positions they frustrated the ambitions of the Enlightenment Party.\n\n\n=== Gapsin Coup ===\n\nIn the two years proceeding the Imo incident, the members of the Gaehwadang had failed to secure appointments to vital offices in the government and were unable to implement their reform plans. As a consequence they were prepared to seize power by all means necessary. In 1884, an opportunity to seize power by staging a coup d'\u00e9tat against the Sadaedang presented itself. In August, as hostilities between France and China erupted over Annam, half of the Chinese troops stationed in Korea were withdrawn. On December 4, 1884, with the help of the Japanese minister Takezoe Shinichiro who promised to mobilize Japanese legation guards to provide assistance, the reformers staged their coup under the guise of a banquet hosted by Hong Yeong-sik, the director of the General Postal Administration. The banquet was to celebrate the opening of the new national post office. King Gojong was expected to attend together with several foreign diplomats and high-ranking officials, most of whom were members of the pro-Chinese Sadaedang faction. Kim Ok-gyun and his comrades approached King Gojong falsely stating that Chinese troops had created a disturbance and escorted him to the small Gyoengu Palace, where they placed him in the custody of Japanese legation guards. They then proceeded to kill and wound several senior officials of the Sadaedang faction.After the coup, the Gaehwadang members formed a new government and devised a program of reform. The radical 14-point reform proposal stated that the following conditions be met: an end to Korea's tributary relationship with China; the abolition of ruling-class privilege and the establishment of equal rights for all; the reorganization of the government as virtually a constitutional monarchy; the revision of land tax laws; cancellation of the grain loan system; the unification of all internal fiscal administrations under the jurisdiction of the Ho-jo; the suppression of privileged merchants and the development of free commerce and trade, the creation of a modern police system including police patrols and royal guards; and severe punishment of corrupt officials.However, the new government lasted no longer than a few days. Particularly, as the reformers were supported by no more than 140 Japanese troops who faced at least 1,500 Chinese garrisoned in Seoul, under the command of General Yuan Shikai. With the reform measures being a threat to her clans' power, Queen Min secretly requested military intervention from the Chinese. Consequently, within three days, even before the reform measures were made public, the coup was suppressed by the Chinese troops who attacked and defeated the Japanese forces and restored power to the pro-Chinese Sadaedang faction. During the ensuing melee Hong Yeong-sik was killed, the Japanese legation building was burned down and forty Japanese were killed. The surviving Korean coup leaders including Kim Ok-gyun escaped to the port of Chemulpo under escort of the Japanese minister Takezoe. From there they boarded a Japanese ship for exile in Japan.In January 1885, with a show of force the Japanese dispatched two battalions and seven warships to Korea, which resulted in the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1885, signed on 9 January 1885. The treaty restored diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea. The Koreans also agreed to pay the Japanese \u00a5100,000 for damages to their legation and to provide a site for the building of a new legation. Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi, in order to overcome Japan's disadvantageous position in Korea followed by the abortive coup, visited China to discuss the matter with his Chinese counterpart, Li Hongzhang. The two parties succeeded in concluding the Convention of Tianjin on May 31, 1885. They also pledged to withdraw their troops from Korea within four months, with prior notification to the other if troops were to be sent to Korea in the future. After both countries withdrew their forces they left behind a precarious balance of power on the Korean Peninsula between the two nations. Meanwhile, Yuan Shikai remained in Seoul, appointed as the Chinese Resident and continued to interfere with Korean domestic politics. The failure of the coup also marked a dramatic decline in Japanese influence over Korea.\n\n\n=== Nagasaki incident ===\n\nThe Nagasaki incident was a riot that took place in the Japanese port city of Nagasaki in 1886. Four warships from the Qing Empire's navy, the Beiyang Fleet, stopped at Nagasaki, apparently to carry out repairs. Some Chinese sailors caused trouble in the city and started the riot. Several Japanese policemen confronting the rioters were killed. The Qing government did not apologize after the incident, which resulted in a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan.\n\n\n=== Bean controversy ===\nA poor harvest in 1889 led the governor of Korea's Hamgyong Province to prohibit soybean exports to Japan. Japan requested and received compensation in 1893 for their importers. The incident highlighted the growing dependence Japan felt on Korean food imports.\n\n\n== Prelude to War ==\n\n\n=== Kim Ok-gyun affair ===\n\nOn March 28, 1894, a pro-Japanese Korean revolutionary, Kim Ok-gyun, was assassinated in Shanghai. Kim had fled to Japan after his involvement in the 1884 coup and the Japanese had turned down Korean demands that he be extradited. Many Japanese activists saw in him potential for a future role in Korean modernization, however, Meiji government leaders were more cautious; after some reservations they exiled him to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands. Ultimately, he was lured to Shanghai, where he was killed by a Korean, Hong Jong-u, in his room at a Japanese inn in the international settlement. After some hesitation, the British authorities in Shanghai concluded that rules against extradition did not apply to a corpse and turned his body over to Chinese authorities. His body was then taken aboard a Chinese warship and sent back to Korea, where it was cut up, quartered and displayed in all Korean provinces as a warning to other purported rebels and traitors.In Tokyo, the Japanese government took this as an outrageous affront. Kim Ok-gyun's brutal murder was portrayed as a betrayal by Li Hongzhang and a setback for Japan's stature and dignity. Not only did the Chinese authorities refuse to press charges against the assassin, but he was even allowed to accompany Kim's mutilated body back to Korea, where he was showered with rewards and honors. Kim's assassination had also called Japan's commitment to its Korean supporters into question. The police in Tokyo had foiled an earlier attempt during the same year to assassinate Pak Yung-hio, one of the other Korean leaders of the 1884 uprising. When two suspected Korean assassins received asylum at the Korean legation, it had also instigated a diplomatic outrage. Although the Japanese government could have immediately used Kim's assassination to its advantage, it concluded that since Kim died on Chinese territory the treatment of the corpse was outside its authority. But the shocking murder of the Korean inflamed Japanese opinion, many in the country considered the Chinese supported actions as also being directed against Japan. To the Japanese, the Chinese had also showed their contempt for international law, when they set free the suspected assassin, who had been arrested by British authorities in Shanghai and then in accordance with treaty obligations turned over to the Chinese for trial. Nationalistic groups immediately began to call for war with China.\n\n\n=== Donghak Rebellion ===\n\nTensions ran high between China and Japan  but war was not yet inevitable and the furor in Japan over the Kim's assassination began to dissipate. However, the following month in late April, the Donghak Rebellion erupted in Korea. Korean peasants rose up in open rebellion against oppressive taxation and incompetent financial administration of the Joseon government, it was the largest peasant rebellion in Korean history. However, on June 1 when rumors reached the Donghaks that the Chinese and Japanese were the verge of sending troops, the rebels agreed to a cease-fire in order to remove any grounds for foreign intervention.On June 2, the Japanese cabinet decided to reciprocally send troops to Korea if China did also. In May, the Chinese had taken steps to prepare for the mobilization of their forces in the provinces of Zhili, Shandong and in Manchuria, as a result of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. But these actions were planned more as an armed demonstration to strengthen their position in Korea, rather than as preparation for war with Japan.\nOn June 3, King Gojong on the recommendation of the Min clan and at the insistence of Yuan Shikai, requested aid from the Chinese government in suppressing the Donghak Rebellion. Although the rebellion was not as serious as it initially seemed and hence Chinese forces were not necessary. The decision was made to send 2,500 men under the command of General Ye Zhichao to the harbour of Asan, about 70 km (43 mi) from Seoul. The troops destined for Korea sailed on board three British owned steamers chartered by the Chinese government, arriving at Asan on June 9. On June 25, a further 400 troops had arrived. Consequently, by the end of June, Ye Zhichao had about 2,800-2,900 soldiers under his command at Asan.Closely watching the events on the peninsula, the Japanese government had quickly become convinced that the Donghak Rebellion would lead to Chinese intervention in Korea. As a result, soon after learning of the Korean government's request for Chinese military help, all Japanese warships in the vicinity were immediately ordered to Pusan and Chemulpo. By June 9, Japanese warships had consecutively called at Chemulpo and Pusan. A formation of 420 sailors, selected from the crews of warships anchored in Chempulo was immediately dispatched to Seoul. There they served as a temporary counterbalance to the Chinese troops camped at Asan. Simultaneously, a reinforced brigade of approximately 8,000 troops(the Oshima Composite Brigade), under the command of General Oshima Yoshimasa, was also dispatched to Chemulpo by June 27.According to the Japanese, the Chinese government had violated the Convention of Tientsin by not informing the Japanese government of its decision to send troops, but the Chinese claimed that Japan had approved this. The Japanese countered by sending an  expeditionary force to Korea. The first 400 troops arrived on June 9 en route to Seoul, and 3,000 landed at Incheon on June 12.However, Japanese officials denied any intention to intervene. As a result, the Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang \"was lured into believing that Japan would not wage war, but the Japanese were fully prepared to act\". The Qing government turned down Japan's suggestion for Japan and China to cooperate to reform the Korean government. When Korea demanded that Japan withdraw its troops from Korea, the Japanese refused.\nIn early June 1894, the 8,000 Japanese troops captured the Korean king Gojong, occupied the Gyeongbokgung in Seoul and, by June 25, replaced the existing Korean government with members of the pro-Japanese faction. Even though Qing forces were already leaving Korea after finding themselves unneeded there, the new pro-Japanese Korean government granted Japan the right to expel Qing forces while Japan dispatched more troops to Korea. The Qing Empire rejected the new Korean government as illegitimate.\n\n\n== Status of combatants ==\n\n\n=== Japan ===\nJapanese reforms under the Meiji government gave significant priority to the creation of an effective modern national army and navy, especially naval construction. Japan sent numerous military officials abroad for training and evaluation of the relative strengths and tactics of Western armies and navies.\n\n\n==== Imperial Japanese Navy ====\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy was modeled after the British Royal Navy, at the time the foremost naval power. British advisors were sent to Japan to train the naval establishment, while Japanese students were in turn sent to Britain to study and observe the Royal Navy. Through drilling and tuition by Royal Navy instructors, Japan developed naval officers expert in the arts of gunnery and seamanship. At the start of hostilities, the Imperial Japanese Navy comprised a fleet of 12 modern warships, (the protected cruiser Izumi being added during the war), eight corvettes, one ironclad warship, 26 torpedo boats, and numerous auxiliary/armed merchant cruisers and converted liners. During peacetime, the warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were divided among three main naval bases at Yokosuka, Kure and Sasebo and following mobilization, the navy was composed of five divisions of seagoing warships and three flotillas of torpedo boats with a fourth being formed at the beginning of hostilities. The Japanese also had a relatively large merchant navy, which at the beginning of 1894 consisted of 288 vessels. Of these, 66 belonged to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha shipping company, which received national subsidies from the Japanese government to maintain the vessels for use by the navy in time of war. As a consequence, the navy could call on a sufficient number of auxiliaries and transports.Japan did not yet have the resources to acquire battleships and so planned to employ the Jeune \u00c9cole doctrine, which favoured small, fast warships, especially cruisers and torpedo boats, with the offensive capability to destroy larger craft. The Japanese naval leadership, on the eve of hostilities, was generally cautious and even apprehensive, as the navy had not yet received the warships ordered in February 1893, particularly the battleships Fuji and Yashima and the protected cruiser Akashi. Hence, initiating hostilities at the time was not ideal, and the navy was far less confident than the army about the outcome of a war with China.Many of Japan's major warships were built in British and French shipyards (eight British, three French and two Japanese-built) and 16 of the torpedo boats were known to have been built in France and assembled in Japan.\n\n\n==== Imperial Japanese Army ====\n\nThe Meiji government at first modeled their army after the French Army. French advisers had been sent to Japan with two military missions (in 1872\u20131880 and 1884), in addition to one mission under the shogunate. Nationwide conscription was enforced in 1873 and a Western-style conscript army was established; military schools and arsenals were also built. In 1886, Japan turned toward the German-Prussian model as the basis for its army, adopting German doctrines and the German military system and organisation. In 1885 Klemens Meckel, a German adviser, implemented new measures, such as the reorganization of the command structure into divisions and regiments; the strengthening of army logistics, transportation, and structures (thereby increasing mobility); and the establishment of artillery and engineering regiments as independent commands. It was also an army that was equal to European armed forces in every respect.\n\nOn the eve of the outbreak of the war with China all men between the ages of 17 and 40 years were eligible for conscription, but only those who turned 20 were to be drafted while those who had turned 17 could volunteer. All men between the ages of 17 and 40, even those who had not received military training or were physically unfit, were considered part of the territorial militia or national guard (kokumin). Following the period of active military service (gen-eki), which lasted for three years, the soldiers became part of the first Reserve (y\u014dbi) and then the second Reserve (k\u014dbi). All young and able-bodied men who did not receive basic military training due to exceptions and those conscripts who had not fully met the physical requirements of military service, became third Reserve (hoj\u016b). In the time of war, the first Reserve (y\u014dbi) were to be called up first and they were intended to fill in the ranks of the regular army units. Next to be called up were the k\u014dbi reserve who were to be either used to further fill in the ranks of line units or to be formed into new ones. The hoj\u016b reserve members were to be called up only in exceptional circumstances, and the territorial militia or national guard would only be called up in case of an immediate enemy attack on or invasion of Japan.The country was divided into six military districts, (headquarters Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, Hiroshima and Kumamoto) with each being a recruitment area for a square infantry division consisting of two brigades of two regiments. Each of these divisions contained approximately 18,600 troops and 36 artillery pieces when mobilized. There was also an Imperial Guard division which recruited nationally, from all around Japan. This division was also composed of two brigades but had instead two-battalion, not three-battalion, regiments, consequently its numerical strength after mobilization was 12,500 troops and 24 artillery pieces. In addition, there were fortress troops consisting of approximately six battalions, the Colonial Corps of about 4,000 troops which was stationed on Hokkaido and the Ryukyu Islands, and a battalion of military police in each of the districts. In peacetime the regular army had a total of fewer than 70,000 men, while after mobilization the numbers rose to over 220,000. Moreover, the army still had a trained reserve, which, following the mobilization of the first-line divisions, could be formed into reserve brigades. These reserve brigades each consisted of four battalions, a cavalry unit, a company of engineers, an artillery battery and rear-echelon units. They were to serve as recruiting bases for their front-line divisions and could also perform secondary combat operations, and if necessary they could be expanded into full divisions with a total of 24 territorial force regiments. However, formation of these units was hindered by a lack of sufficient amounts of equipment, especially uniforms.Japanese troops were equipped with the 8mm single-shot Murata Type 18 breech-loading rifle. The improved five-round-magazine Type 22 was just being introduced and consequently in 1894, on the eve of the war, only the Imperial Guard and 4th Division were equipped with these rifles. The division artillery consisted of 75mm field guns and mountain pieces manufactured in Osaka. The artillery was based on Krupp designs that were adapted by the Italians at the beginning of the 1880s; although it could hardly be described as modern in 1894, in general it still matched contemporary battlefield requirements.By the 1890s, Japan had at its disposal a modern, professionally trained Western-style army which was relatively well equipped and supplied. Its officers had studied in Europe and were well educated in the latest strategy and tactics. By the start of the war, the Imperial Japanese Army could field a total force of 120,000 men in two armies and five divisions.\n\n\n=== China ===\nThe prevailing view in many Western circles was that the modernized Chinese military would crush the Japanese. Observers commended Chinese units such as the Huai Army and Beiyang Fleet. The German General Staff predicted a Japanese defeat and William Lang, who was a British advisor to the Chinese military, praised Chinese training, ships, guns, and fortifications, stating that \"in the end, there is no doubt that Japan must be utterly crushed\".\n\n\n==== Imperial Chinese Army ====\n\nThe Qing Dynasty did not have a unified national army, but was made up of three main components, with the so-called Eight Banners forming the elite. The Eight Banners forces were segregated along ethnic lines into separate Manchu, Han Chinese, Mongol, Hui (Muslim) and other ethnic formations. Bannermen who made up the Eight Banners got higher pay than the rest of the army while the Manchu received further privileges. In total, there were 250,000 soldiers in the Eight Banners, with over 60 per cent kept in garrisons in Beijing, while the remaining 40 per cent served as garrison troops in other major Chinese cities. The Green Standard Army was a 600,000-strong gendarmerie-type force that was recruited from the majority Han Chinese population. Its soldiers were not given any peacetime basic military training, but were expected to fight in any conflict. The third component was an irregular force called the Braves, which were used as a kind of reserve force for the regular army, and which were usually recruited from the more distant or remote provinces of China. They were formed into very loosely organized units from the same province. The Braves were sometimes described as mercenaries, with their volunteers receiving as much military training as their commanders saw fit. With no fixed unit organization, it is impossible to know how many battle-ready Braves there actually were in 1894. There were also other, smaller number of military formations, one of which was the Huai Army, which was under the personal authority of the politician, general and diplomat Li Hongzhang and was created originally to suppress the Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864). The Huai Army had received limited training by Western military advisors; numbering nearly 45,000 troops, it was considered the best armed military unit in China.Although the Chinese had established arsenals to produce firearms, and a large number of them had been imported from abroad, 40 per cent of Chinese troops at the outbreak of the war were not issued with rifles or even muskets. Instead they were armed with a variety of swords, spears, pikes, halberds, and bows and arrows. Against well-trained, well-armed, and disciplined Japanese troops, they would have little chance. Those units that did have firearms were equipped with a heterogeneity of weapons, from a variety of modern rifles to old-fashioned muskets; this lack of standardization led to a major problem with the proper supply of ammunition.The Imperial Chinese Army in 1894 was a heterogeneous mixture of modernized, partly modernized, and almost medieval units which no commander could have led successfully, leading to poor leadership among Chinese officers. Chinese officers did not know how to handle their troops and the older, higher-ranking officers still believed that they could fight a war as they had during the Taiping Rebellion of 1850\u20131864. This was also the result of the Chinese military forces being divided into largely independent regional commands. The soldiers were drawn from diverse provinces that had no affinity with each other. Chinese troops also suffered from poor morale, largely because many of the troops had not been paid for a long time. The low prestige of soldiers in Chinese society also hindered morale, and the use of opium and other narcotics was rife throughout the army. Low morale and poor leadership seriously reduced the effectiveness of Chinese troops, and contributed to defeats such as the abandonment of the very well-fortified and defensible Weihaiwei. Additionally, military logistics were lacking, as the construction of railroads in Manchuria had been discouraged. Huai Army troops, although they were a small minority in the overall Imperial Chinese Army, were to take part in the majority of the fighting during the war.\n\n\n==== Beiyang Fleet ====\n\nThe Beiyang Fleet was one of the four modernised Chinese navies in the late Qing dynasty. The navies were heavily sponsored by Li Hongzhang, the Viceroy of Zhili who had also created the Huai Army. The Beiyang Fleet was the dominant navy in East Asia before the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese themselves were apprehensive about facing the Chinese fleet, especially the two German-built battleships \u2014 Dingyuan and Zhenyuan \u2013 to which the Japanese had no comparable counterparts. However, China's advantages were more apparent than real as most of the Chinese warships were over-age and obsolescent; the ships were also not maintained properly and indiscipline was common among their crews. The greater armor of major Chinese warships and the greater weight of broadside they could fire were more than offset by the number of quick-firing guns on most first-line Japanese warships, which gave the Japanese the edge in any sustained exchange of salvos. The worst feature of both Chinese battleships was actually their main armament; each was armed with short-barreled guns in twin barbettes mounted in echelon which could fire only in restricted arcs. The short barrels of the Chinese main armament meant that the shells had a low muzzle velocity and poor penetration, and their accuracy was also poor at long ranges.Tactically, Chinese naval vessels entered the war with only the crudest set of instructions \u2014 ships that were assigned to designated pairs were to keep together and all ships were to fight end-on, as far forward from the beam as possible, a tactic dictated by the obsolescent arrangement of guns aboard Chinese warships. The only vague resemblance of a fleet tactic was that all ships were to follow the visible movements of the flagship, an arrangement made necessary because the signal book used by the Chinese was written in English, a language with which few officers in the Beiyang Fleet had any familiarity.When it was first developed by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1888, the Beiyang Fleet was said to be the strongest navy in East Asia. Before her adopted son, Emperor Guangxu, took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. Japan's victories over China has often been falsely rumored to be the fault of Cixi. Many believed that Cixi was the cause of the navy's defeat because Cixi embezzled funds from the navy in order to build the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, extensive research by Chinese historians revealed that Cixi was not the cause of the Chinese navy's decline. In actuality, China's defeat was caused by Emperor Guangxu's lack of interest in developing and maintaining the military. His close adviser, Grand Tutor Weng Tonghe, advised Guangxu to cut all funding to the navy and army, because he did not see Japan as a true threat, and there were several natural disasters during the early 1890s which the emperor thought to be more pressing to expend funds on.\n\n\n=== Contemporaneous wars fought by the Qing Empire ===\nWhile the Qing Empire was fighting the First Sino-Japanese War, it was also simultaneously engaging rebels in the Dungan Revolt in northwestern China, where thousands lost their lives. The generals Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang and Ma Haiyan were initially summoned by the Qing government to bring the Hui troops under their command to participate in the First Sino-Japanese War, but they were eventually sent to suppress the Dungan Revolt instead.\n\n\n== Early stages ==\n1 June 1894: The Donghak Rebel Army moves toward Seoul. The Korean government requests help from the Qing government to suppress the revolt.\n6 June 1894: About 2,465 Chinese soldiers are transported to Korea to suppress the Donghak Rebellion. Japan asserts that it was not notified and thus China has violated the Convention of Tientsin, which requires that China and Japan must notify each other before intervening in Korea. China asserts that Japan was notified and approved of Chinese intervention.\n8 June 1894: First of about 4,000 Japanese soldiers and 500 marines land at Jemulpo (Incheon).\n11 June 1894: End of the Donghak Rebellion.\n13 June 1894: The Japanese government telegraphs the commander of the Japanese forces in Korea, \u014ctori Keisuke, to remain in Korea for as long as possible despite the end of the rebellion.\n16 June 1894: Japanese foreign minister Mutsu Munemitsu meets with Wang Fengzao, the Qing ambassador to Japan, to discuss the future status of Korea. Wang states that the Qing government intends to pull out of Korea after the rebellion has been suppressed and expects Japan to do the same. However, China retains a resident to look after Chinese primacy in Korea.\n22 June 1894: Additional Japanese troops arrive in Korea. Japanese prime minister It\u014d Hirobumi tells Matsukata Masayoshi that since the Qing Empire appear to be making military preparations, there is probably \"no policy but to go to war\". Mutsu tells \u014ctori to press the Korean government on the Japanese demands.\n26 June 1894: \u014ctori presents a set of reform proposals to the Korean king Gojong. Gojong's government rejects the proposals and instead insists on troop withdrawals.\n7 July 1894: Failure of mediation between China and Japan arranged by the British ambassador to China.\n19 July 1894: Establishment of the Japanese Combined Fleet, consisting of almost all vessels in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Mutsu cables \u014ctori to take any necessary steps to compel the Korean government to carry out a reform program.\n23 July 1894: Japanese troops occupy Seoul, capture Gojong, and establish a new, pro-Japanese government, which terminates all Sino-Korean treaties and grants the Imperial Japanese Army the right to expel the Qing Empire's Beiyang Army from Korea.\n25 July 1894: First battle of the war: the Battle of Pungdo / Hoto-oki kaisen\n\n\n== Events during the war ==\n\n\n=== Opening moves ===\nBy July 1894, Chinese forces in Korea numbered 3,000\u20133,500 and were outnumbered by Japanese troops. They could only be supplied by sea through Asan Bay. The Japanese objective was first to blockade the Chinese at Asan and then encircle them with their land forces. Japan's initial strategy was to gain command of the sea, which was critical to its operations in Korea. Command of the sea would allow Japan to transport troops to the mainland. The army's Fifth Division would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces northwest up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. Depending on the outcome of this engagement, Japan would make one of three choices; If the Combined Fleet were to win decisively, the larger part of the Japanese army would undertake immediate landings on the coast between Shan-hai-kuan and Tientsin in order to defeat the Chinese army and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If the engagement were to be a draw and neither side gained control of the sea, the army would concentrate on the occupation of Korea. Lastly, if the Combined Fleet was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, the bulk of the army would remain in Japan and prepare to repel a Chinese invasion, while the Fifth Division in Korea would be ordered to hang on and fight a rearguard action.\n\n\n=== Sinking of the Kow-shing ===\n\nOn 25 July 1894, the cruisers Yoshino, Naniwa and Akitsushima of the Japanese flying squadron, which had been patrolling off Asan Bay, encountered the Chinese cruiser Tsi-yuan and gunboat Kwang-yi. These vessels had steamed out of Asan to meet the transport Kow-shing, escorted by the Chinese gunboat Tsao-kiang. After an hour-long engagement, the Tsi-yuan escaped while the Kwang-yi grounded on rocks, where its powder-magazine exploded.\nThe Kow-shing was a 2,134-ton British merchant vessel owned by the Indochina Steam Navigation Company of London, commanded by Captain T. R. Galsworthy and crewed by 64 men. The ship was chartered by the Qing government to ferry troops to Korea, and was on her way to reinforce Asan with 1,100 troops plus supplies and equipment. A German artillery officer, Major von Hanneken, advisor to the Chinese, was also aboard. The ship was due to arrive on 25 July.\nThe Japanese cruiser Naniwa, under Captain T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, intercepted the Kow-shing and captured its escort. The Japanese then ordered the Kow-shing to follow Naniwa and directed that Europeans be transferred to Naniwa. However, the 1,100 Chinese on board, desperate to return to Taku, threatened to kill the English captain, Galsworthy, and his crew. After four hours of negotiations, Captain Togo gave the order to fire upon the vessel. A torpedo missed, but a subsequent broadside hit the Kow Shing, which started to sink.\nIn the confusion, some of the Europeans escaped overboard, only to be fired upon by the Chinese. The Japanese rescued three of the British crew (the captain, first officer and quartermaster) and 50 Chinese, and took them to Japan. The sinking of the Kow-shing almost caused a diplomatic incident between Japan and Great Britain, but the action was ruled in conformity with international law regarding the treatment of mutineers (the Chinese troops). Many observers considered the troops lost on board the Kow-shing to have been the best the Chinese had.The German gunboat Iltis rescued 150 Chinese, the French gunboat Le Lion rescued 43, and the British cruiser HMS Porpoise rescued an unknown number.\n\n\n=== Conflict in Korea ===\n\nCommissioned by the new pro-Japanese Korean government to forcibly expel Chinese forces, on July 25 Major-General \u014cshima Yoshimasa led a mixed brigade numbering about 4,000 on a rapid forced march from Seoul south toward Asan Bay to face Chinese troops garrisoned at Seonghwan Station east of Asan and Kongju.\nThe Chinese forces stationed near Seonghwan under the command of General Ye Zhichao numbered about 3,880 men. They had anticipated the impending arrival of the Japanese by fortifying their position with trenches, earthworks including six redoubts protected by abatis and by the flooding of surrounding rice fields. But expected Chinese reinforcements had been lost on board the British-chartered transport Kowshing. Units of the Chinese main force were deployed east and north-east of Asan, near the main road leading to Seoul, the key positions held by the Chinese were the towns of Seonghwan and Cheonan. Approximately 3,000 troops were stationed at Seonghwan, while 1,000 men along with General Ye Zhichao headquarters were at the Cheonan. The remaining Chinese troops were stationed in Asan itself. The Chinese had been preparing for a pincer movement against the Korean capital by massing troops at Pyongyang in the north and Asan in the south.On the morning of 27-28 July 1894, the two forces met just outside Asan in an engagement that lasted till 7:30am, the next morning. The battle began with a diversionary attack by Japanese troops, followed by the main attack which quickly outflanked the Chinese defences. The Chinese troops, witnessing that they were being outflanked, left their defensive positions and fled towards the direction of Asan. The Chinese gradually lost ground to the superior Japanese numbers, and finally broke and fled towards Pyongyang abandoning arms, ammunition and all its artillery. The Japanese took the city of Asan on July 29, breaking the Chinese encirclement of Seoul. The Chinese suffered 500 killed and wounded while the Japanese suffered 88 casualties.\n\n\n=== Comparative Outlooks of the Japanese and Chinese Emperors ===\nOn 1 August, war was officially declared between China and Japan. The rationale given by the rulers of both nations might best be assessed by the comparison of the declarations issued from each; the language and tone being markedly different. In the case of Japan:  \n\nWe, by the grace of Heaven, Emperor of Japan, seated on a Throne occupied by the same dynasty from time immemorial, do hereby make proclamation to all our loyal and brave subjects, as follows: \nWe hereby declare war against China, and we command each and all our competent authorities, in obedience to our wish and with a view to the attainment of the national aim, to carry on hostilities by sea and by land against China, with all the means at their disposal, consistently with the Law of Nations.\nDuring the past three decades of our reign our constant aim has been to further the peaceful progress of the country in civilization; and, being sensible of the evils inseparable from complications with foreign states, it has always been our pleasure to instruct our Minister of State to labour for the promotion of friendly relations with our Treaty Powers. We are gratified to know that the relations of our Empire with those Powers have yearly increased in good will and in friendship. Under the circumstances, we were unprepared for such a conspicuous want of amity and of good faith as has been manifested by China in her conduct towards this country in connexion with the Korean affair.\nKorea is an independent state. She was first introduced into the family of nations by the advice and guidance of Japan. It has, however, been China's habit to designate Korea as her dependency, and both openly and secretly to interfere with her domestic affairs. At the time of the recent insurrection in Korea, China despatched troops thither, alleging that her purpose was to afford a succour to her dependent state. We, in virtue of the treaty concluded with Korea in 1882, and looking to possible emergencies, caused a military force to be sent to that country.\nWishing to procure for Korea freedom from the calamity of perpetual disturbance, and thereby to maintain the peace of the East in general, Japan invited China's cooperation for the accomplishment of the object. But China, advancing various pretexts, declined Japan's proposal. Thereupon Japan advised Korea to reform her administration so that order and tranquillity might be preserved at home, and so that the country might be able to discharge the responsibilities and duties of an independent state abroad. Korea has already consented to undertake the task. But China has secretly and insidiously endeavoured to circumvent and to thwart Japan's purpose. She has further procrastinated and endeavoured to make warlike preparations both on land and at sea. \nWhen those preparations were completed she not only sent large reinforcements to Korea, with a view to the forcible attainment of her ambitious designs, but even carried her arbitrariness and insolence to the extent of opening fire upon our ships in Korean waters. China's plain object is to make it uncertain where the responsibility resides of preserving peace and order in Korea, and not only to weaken the position of that state in the family of nations - a position obtained for Korea through Japan's efforts - but also to obscure the significance of the treaties recognizing and confirming that position. Such conduct on the part of China is not only a direct injury to the rights and interests of this Empire, but also a menace to the permanent peace and tranquillity of the Orient. \nJudging from her actions, it must be concluded that China from the beginning has been bent upon sacrificing peace to the attainment of her sinister object. In this situation, ardent as our wish is to promote the prestige of the country abroad by strictly peaceful methods, we find it impossible to avoid a formal declaration of war against China. It is our earnest wish that, by the loyalty and valour of our faithful subjects, peace may soon be permanently restored and the glory of the Empire be augmented and completed.\n\nGiven this 1st day of the eighth month of the 27th year of Meiji...\nIssued in the name of the Meiji Emperor, the tenor of the Japanese declaration of war appears to have had at least one eye fixed on the wider international community; using phrases such as 'Family of Nations', the 'Law of Nations' and making additional references to international treaties. This was in sharp contrast to the Chinese approach to foreign relations, (historically noted for refusing to treat with other nations on a diplomatic footing, and instead insistent on such foreign powers paying tribute to the Chinese Emperor as vassals - see Tributary system of China). In keeping with the traditional Chinese approach to its neighbours, the Guangxu Emperor thus proclaimed: \n\nKorea has been our tributary for the past two hundred odd years. She has given us tribute all this time, which is a matter known to the world. For the past dozen years or so Korea has been troubled by repeated insurrections and we, in sympathy with our small tributary, have as repeatedly sent succour to her aid, eventually placing a Resident in her capital to protect Korea's interests. In the fourth moon (May) of this year another rebellion was begun in Korea, and the King repeatedly asked again for aid from us to put down the rebellion. We then ordered Li Hung-Chang [Li Hongzhang] to send troops to Korea; and they having barely reached Yashan the rebels immediately scattered. But the Wojen, without any cause whatever, suddenly sent their troops to Korea, and entered Seoul, the capital of Korea, reinforcing them constantly until they have exceeded ten thousand men. In the meantime the Japanese forced the Korean king to change his system of government, showing a disposition every way of bullying the Koreans.\nIt was found a difficult matter to reason with the Wojen. Although we have been in the habit of assisting our tributaries, we have never interfered with their internal government. Japan's treaty with Korea was as one country with another; there is no law for sending large armies to bully a country in this way, and compel it to change its system of government. The various powers are united in condemning the conduct of the Japanese, and can give no reasonable name to the army she now has in Korea. Nor has Japan been amenable to reason, nor would she listen to the exhortation to withdraw her troops and confer amicably upon what should be done in Korea. On the contrary, Japan has shown herself bellicose without regard to appearances, and has been increasing her forces there. Her conduct alarmed the people of Korea as well as our merchants there, and so we sent more troops over to protect them. Judge of our surprise then when, halfway to Korea, a number of the Wojen ships suddenly appeared, and taking advantage of our unpreparedness, opened fire upon our transports at a spot on the sea-coast near Yashan, and damaged them, thus causing us to suffer from their treacherous conduct, which could not be foretold by us. As Japan has violated the treaties and not observed international laws, and is now running rampant with her false and treacherous actions commencing hostilities herself, and laying herself open to condemnation by the various powers at large, we therefore desire to make it known to the world that we have always followed the paths of philanthropy and perfect justice throughout the whole complications, while the Wojen, on the other hand, have broken all the laws of nations and treaties which it passes our patience to bear with. \nHence we have commanded Li Hung-Chang [Li Hongzhang] to give strict orders to our various armies to hasten with all speed to root the Wojen out of their lairs. He is to send successive armies of valiant men to Korea in order to save the Koreans from the dust of bondage. We also command the Manchu generals, viceroys and governors of the maritime provinces, as well as the commanders-in-chief of the various armies, to prepare for war and to make every effort to fire on the Wojen ships if they come into our ports, and utterly destroy them. We exhort our generals to refrain from the least laxity in obeying our commands in order to avoid severe punishment at our hands. Let all know this edict as if addressed to themselves individually.\n\nRespect this!\nIn the latter declaration of the Chinese Emperor, the palpable disdain for the Japanese can be surmised from the repeated use of the term Wojen, (which translates to the intentionally-offensive term  'dwarf' ). This use of the pejorative to describe a foreign nation was not unusual for Chinese official documents of the time; so much so, that a major bone of contention between Imperial China and the Treaty Powers of the day had previously been the habitual use of the Chinese character \u5937, ('Yi'...which literally meant 'barbarian'), to refer to those termed otherwise as 'Foreign Devils', (typically, those powers occupying the Treaty Ports). The use of the term 'Yi' (\u5937) by Chinese Imperial officials had in fact been considered so provocative by the Treaty Powers, that the collective bundle of accords known as the Treaty of Tientsin, (negotiated in 1858 to end the Second Opium War), explicitly proscribed the Chinese Imperial Court from using the term 'Yi' - to refer to officials, subjects, or citizens of the four belligerent powers, (namely, the Russian Empire, France, Great Britain and the United States of America); the signatories seemingly feeling it necessary to extract this specific demand from the Xianfeng Emperor's representatives. In the thirty-five years elapsing since the Treaty of Tientsin, however, the language of the Chinese Emperors would appear to change little with regards to its neighbour, Japan.  \n\n\n=== After the Declarations ===\nBy 4 August, the remaining Chinese forces in Korea retreated to the northern city of Pyongyang, where they were met by troops sent from China. The 13,000\u201315,000 defenders made defensive repairs to the city, hoping to check the Japanese advance.\nOn 15 September, the Imperial Japanese Army converged on the city of Pyongyang from several directions. The Japanese assaulted the city and eventually defeated the Chinese by an attack from the rear; the defenders surrendered. Taking advantage of heavy rainfall overnight, the remaining Chinese troops escaped Pyongyang and headed northeast toward the coastal city of Uiju. Casualties were 2,000 killed and around 4,000 wounded for the Chinese, while the Japanese casualties totaled 102 men killed, 433 wounded, and 33 missing. In the early morning of 16 September, the entire Japanese army entered Pyongyang.\nQing Hui Muslim general Zuo Baogui, from Shandong province, died in action in Pyongyang from Japanese artillery in 1894 while securing the city. A memorial to him was constructed.\n\n\n=== Defeat of the Beiyang fleet ===\n\nIn early September, Li Hongzhang decided to reinforce the Chinese forces at Pyongyang by employing the Beiyang fleet to escort transports to the mouth of the Taedong River. About 4,500 additional troops stationed in the Zhili were to be redeployed. On September 12, half of the troops embarked at Dagu on five specially chartered transports and headed to Dalian where two days later on September 14, they were joined by another 2,000 soldiers. Initially, Admiral Ding wanted to send the transports under a light escort with only a few ships, while the main force of the Beiyang Fleet would locate and operate directly against Combined Fleet in order to prevent the Japanese from intercepting the convoy. But the appearance of the Japanese cruisers Yoshino and Naniwa on a reconnaissance sortie near Weihaiwei thwarted these plans. The Chinese had mistaken them for the main Japanese fleet. Consequently, on September 12, the entire Beiyang Fleet departed Dalian heading for Weihaiwei, arriving near the Shandong Peninsula the next day. The Chinese warships spent the entire day cruising the area, waiting for the Japanese. However, since there was no sighting of the Japanese fleet, Admiral Ding decided to return to Dalian, reaching the port in the morning of September 15. As Japanese troops moved north to attack Pyongyang, Admiral Ito correctly guessed that the Chinese would attempt to reinforce their army in Korea by sea. On 14 September, the Combined Fleet steamed northwards to search the Korean and Chinese coasts in order to bring the Beiyang Fleet to battle.The Japanese victory at Pyongyang had succeeded in pushing Chinese troops north to the Yalu river, in the process removing all effective Chinese military presence on the Korean Peninsula.\nShortly before the convoy's departure, Admiral Ding received a message concerning the battle at Pyongyang informing him about the defeat. Subsequently, it made the redeployment of the troops to the mouth of the Taedong river unnecessary. Admiral Ding then correctly assumed that the next Chinese line of defence would be established on the Yalu River, and decided to redeploy the embarked soldiers there. On September 16, the convoy of five transport ships departed from the Dalian Bay under escort from the vessels of the Beiyang Fleet which included the two ironclad battleships, Dingyuan and Zhenyuan. Reaching the mouth of the Yalu River, the transports disembarked the troops, and the landing operation lasted until the following morning.\nOn September 17, 1894, the Japanese Combined Fleet encountered the Chinese Beiyang Fleet off the mouth of the Yalu River. The naval battle, which lasted from late morning to dusk, resulted in a Japanese victory. Although the Chinese were able to land 4,500 troops near the Yalu River by sunset the Beiyang fleet was near the point of total collapse, most of the fleet had fled or had been sunk and the two largest ships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan were nearly out of ammunition. The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed eight of the ten Chinese warships, assuring Japan's command of the Yellow Sea. The principal factors in the Japanese victory was the superiority in speed and firepower. The victory shattered the morale of the Chinese naval forces. The Battle of the Yalu River was the largest naval engagement of the war and was a major propaganda victory for Japan.\n\n\n=== Invasion of Manchuria ===\n\nWith the defeat at Pyongyang, the Chinese abandoned northern Korea and took up defensive positions in fortifications along their side of the Yalu River near Jiuliancheng. After receiving reinforcements by 10 October, the Japanese quickly pushed north toward Manchuria.\n\nOn the night of 24 October 1894, the Japanese successfully crossed the Yalu River, undetected, by erecting a pontoon bridge. The following afternoon of 25 October at 17:00, they assaulted the outpost of Hushan, east of Jiuliancheng. At 20:30 the defenders deserted their positions and by the next day they were in full retreat from Jiuliancheng.\nWith the capture of Jiuliancheng, General Yamagata's 1st Army Corps occupied the nearby city of Dandong, while to the north, elements of the retreating Beiyang Army set fire to the city of Fengcheng. The Japanese had established a firm foothold on Chinese territory with the loss of only four killed and 140 wounded.The Japanese 1st Army Corps then split into two groups with General Nozu Michitsura's 5th Provincial Division advancing toward the city of Mukden (present-day Shenyang) and Lieutenant-General Katsura Tar\u014d's 3rd Provincial Division pursuing fleeing Chinese forces west along toward the Liaodong Peninsula.\nBy December, the 3rd Provincial Division had captured the towns of Tatungkau, Takushan, Xiuyan, Tomucheng, Haicheng and Kangwaseh. The 5th Provincial Division marched during a severe Manchurian winter towards Mukden.\nThe Japanese 2nd Army Corps under \u014cyama Iwao landed on the south coast of Liaodong Peninsula on 24 October and quickly moved to capture Jinzhou and Dalian Bay on 6\u20137 November. The Japanese laid siege to the strategic port of L\u00fcshunkou (Port Arthur).\n\n\n=== Fall of L\u00fcshunkou ===\n\nBy 21 November 1894, the Japanese had taken the city of L\u00fcshunkou (Port Arthur) with minimal resistance and suffering minimal casualties. Describing their motives as having encountered a display of the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers as they invaded the town, Japanese forces proceeded with the unrestrained killing of civilians during the Port Arthur Massacre with unconfirmed estimates in the thousands. An event which at the time was widely viewed with scepticism as the world at large was still in disbelief that the Japanese were capable of such deeds that seemed more likely to have been exaggerated propagandist fabrications of a Chinese government to discredit Japanese hegemony. In reality, the Chinese government itself was unsure of how to react and initially denied the occurrence of the loss of Port Arthur to the Japanese altogether.\n\nAs we entered the town of Port Arthur, we saw the head of a Japanese soldier displayed on a wooden stake. This filled us with rage and a desire to crush any Chinese soldier. Anyone we saw in the town, we killed. The streets were filled with corpses, so many they blocked our way. We killed people in their homes; by and large, there wasn't a single house without from three to six dead. Blood was flowing and the smell was awful. We sent out search parties. We shot some, hacked at others. The Chinese troops just dropped their arms and fled. Firing and slashing, it was unbounded joy. At this time, our artillery troops were at the rear, giving three cheers [banzai] for the emperor.\nBy 10 December 1894, Kaipeng (present-day Gaizhou) fell to the Japanese 1st Army Corps.\n\n\n=== Fall of Weihaiwei ===\n\nThe Chinese fleet subsequently retreated behind the Weihaiwei fortifications. However, they were then surprised by Japanese ground forces, who outflanked the harbour's defenses in coordination with the navy. The Battle of Weihaiwei was a 23-day siege with the major land and naval components taking place between 20 January and 12 February 1895. Historian Jonathan Spence notes that \"the Chinese admiral retired his fleet behind a protective curtain of contact mines and took no further part in the fighting.\" The Japanese commander marched his forces over the Shandong peninsula and reached the landward side of Weihaiwei, where the siege was eventually successful for the Japanese.After Weihaiwei's fall on 12 February 1895, and an easing of harsh winter conditions, Japanese troops pressed further into southern Manchuria and northern China. By March 1895 the Japanese had fortified posts that commanded the sea approaches to Beijing. Although this would be the last major battle fought; numerous skirmishes would follow. The Battle of Yinkou was fought outside the port town of Yingkou, Manchuria, on 5 March 1895.\n\n\n=== Occupation of the Pescadores Islands ===\n\nEven before the peace negotiations were set to begin at Shimonoseki, the Japanese had begun preparations for the capture of Taiwan. However, the first operation would be directed not against the island itself, but against the Pescadores Islands, which due to their strategic position off the west coast would become a stepping stone for further operations against the island. On March 6, a Japanese expeditionary force consisting of a reinforced infantry regiment with 2,800 troops and an artillery battery were embarked on five transports, sailed from Ujina to Sasebo, arriving there three days later. On March 15, the five transports were escorted by seven cruisers and five torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla, left Sasebo heading south. The Japanese fleet arrived at the Pescadores during the night of March 20, but encountered stormy weather. Due to the poor weather, the landings were postponed until March 23, when the weather cleared.On the morning March 23, the Japanese warships began the bombardment of the Chinese positions around the port of Lizhangjiao. A fort guarding the harbor was quickly silenced. At about midday, the Japanese troops began their landing. Unexpectedly, when the landing operation was underway, the guns of the fort once again opened fire, which caused some confusion among the Japanese troops. But they were soon silenced again after being shelled by the Japanese cruisers. By 2:00pm, Lizhangjiao was under Japanese control. After reinforcing the captured positions, the following morning, Japanese troops marched on the main town of Magong. The Chinese offered token resistance and after a short skirmish they abandoned their positions, retreating to nearby Xiyu Island. At 11:30am, the Japanese entered Magong, but as soon as they had taken the coastal forts in the town, they were fired upon by the Chinese coastal battery on Xiyu Island. The barrage went unanswered until nightfall, as the Chinese had destroyed all the guns at Magong before they retreated, and Japanese warships feared entering the strait between the Penghu and Xiyu Islands due to the potential threat posed by mines. However, it caused no serious casualties among the Japanese forces. During that night, a small naval gunnery crew of 30, managed to make one of guns of the Magong coastal battery operational. At dawn, the gun began shelling the Chinese positions on Xiyu, but the Chinese guns did not respond. Subsequently, the Japanese crossed the narrow strait reaching Xiyu, discovering that the Chinese troops had abandoned their positions during the night and escaped on board local vessels.The Japanese warships entered the strait the next day and, upon discovering that there were no mine fields, they entered Magong harbor. By March 26, all the islands of the archipelago were under Japanese control, and Rear Admiral Tanaka Tsunatsune was appointed the governor. During the campaign the Japanese lost 28 killed and wounded, while the Chinese losses were almost 350 killed or wounded and nearly 1,000 taken prisoner. This operation effectively prevented Chinese forces in Taiwan from being reinforced, and allowed the Japanese to press their demand for the cession of Taiwan in the peace negotiations.\n\n\n== End of the war ==\n\n\n=== Treaty of Shimonoseki ===\n\nThe Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on 17 April 1895. China recognized the total independence of Korea and ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan and Penghu Islands to Japan \"in perpetuity\". The disputed islands known as \"Senkaku/Diaoyu\" islands were not named by this treaty, but Japan annexed these uninhabited islands to Okinawa Prefecture in 1895. Japan asserts this move was taken independently of the treaty ending the war, and China asserts that they were implied as part of the cession of Taiwan.\nAdditionally, the China was to pay Japan 200 million taels (8,000,000 kg/17,600,000 lb) of silver as war reparations. The Qing government also signed a commercial treaty permitting Japanese ships to operate on the Yangtze River, to operate manufacturing factories in treaty ports and to open four more ports to foreign trade. Russia, Germany and France in a few days made the Triple Intervention, however, and forced Japan to give up the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for another 30 million taels of silver (equivalent to about 450 million yen).\nAfter the war, the Qing government paid 200 million Kuping taels, or 311,072,865 yen, making the war a net profit for Japan, as their war fund was only 250,000,000 yen.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion of Taiwan ===\n\n\"The cession of the island to Japan was received with such disfavour by the Chinese inhabitants that a large military force was required to effect its occupation. For nearly two years afterwards, a bitter guerrilla resistance was offered to the Japanese troops, and large forces \u2014 over 100,000 men, it was stated at the time \u2014 were required for its suppression. This was not accomplished without much cruelty on the part of the conquerors, who, in their march through the island, perpetrated all the worst excesses of war. They had, undoubtedly, considerable provocation. They were constantly ambushed by enemies, and their losses from battle and disease far exceeded the entire loss of the whole Japanese army throughout the Manchurian campaign. But their revenge was often taken on innocent villagers. Men, women, and children were ruthlessly slaughtered or became the victims of unrestrained lust and rapine. The result was to drive from their homes thousands of industrious and peaceful peasants, who, long after the main resistance had been completely crushed, continued to wage a vendetta war, and to generate feelings of hatred which the succeeding years of conciliation and good government have not wholly eradicated.\" \u2013 The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 12\n\nSeveral Qing officials in Taiwan resolved to resist the cession of Taiwan to Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and on 23 May declared the island to be an independent Republic of Formosa. On 29 May, Japanese forces under Admiral Motonori Kabayama landed in northern Taiwan, and in a five-month campaign defeated the Republican forces and occupied the island's main towns. The campaign effectively ended on 21 October 1895, with the flight of Liu Yongfu, the second Republican president, and the surrender of the Republican capital Tainan.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe Japanese success during the war was the result of the modernisation and industrialisation embarked upon two decades earlier. The war demonstrated the superiority of Japanese tactics and training from the adoption of a Western-style military. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy were able to inflict a string of defeats on the Chinese through foresight, endurance, strategy and power of organisation. Japan's prestige rose in the eyes of the world, and the victory reflected the success of the Meiji Restoration. Japan only suffered a small loss of lives and treasure in return for the dominance of Taiwan, the Pescadores and the Liaotung Peninsula in China.  Their decisions of abandoning the policy of isolation and learning advanced policy from Western countries also became a good example for other Asian countries to follow. As a result of this war, Japan started to have equal status with the powers of the West,  and the victory established Japan as the dominant power in Asia. It also heightened their ambitions of aggression and military expansion in Asia. Because Japan had benefited a lot from the Treaty, it stimulated Japanese ambition to continue to invade China. It made the Chinese national crisis unprecedentedly serious. The degree of semi-colonization was greatly deepened. After Japan's victory, the other Imperialist powers thought they could also get benefits from China. Then these Imperialist powers started to partition China over the next few years.\nFor China, the war revealed the high level of corruption present in the government and policies of the Qing administration. Traditionally, China viewed Japan as a subordinate part of the Chinese cultural sphere. Although China had been defeated by European powers in the 19th century, defeat at the hands of an Asian power was a bitter psychological blow. Anti-foreign sentiment and agitation grew, which would later culminate in the form of the Boxer Rebellion five years later. The Manchu population was devastated by the fighting during the First Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion, with massive casualties sustained during the wars and subsequently being driven into extreme suffering and hardship in Beijing and northeast China.\n\nAlthough Japan had achieved what it had set out to accomplish and ended Chinese influence over Korea, Japan had been forced to relinquish the Liaodong Peninsula, (Port Arthur), in exchange for an increased financial indemnity. The European powers (especially Russia) had no objection to the other clauses of the treaty but felt that Japan should not gain Port Arthur, for they had their own ambitions in that part of the world. Russia persuaded Germany and France to join in applying diplomatic pressure on Japan, resulting in the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895.\nAlthough Japan had succeeded in eliminating Chinese influence over Korea, it was Russia who reaped the benefits. Korea proclaimed itself the Korean Empire and announced its independence from the Qing Empire. The Japanese-sponsored Gabo reforms (Kabo reforms) of 1894\u20131896 transformed Korea: legal slavery was abolished in all forms; the yangban class lost all special privileges; outcastes were abolished; equality of law; equality of opportunity in the face of social background; child marriage was abolished, Hangul was to be used in government documents; Korean history was introduced in schools; the Chinese calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar; education was expanded and new textbooks written.In 1895, a pro-Russian official tried to remove the King of Korea to the Russian legation and failed, but a second attempt succeeded. Thus, for a year, the King reigned from the Russian legation in Seoul. The concession to build a Seoul-Inchon railway that had been granted to Japan in 1894 was revoked and granted to Russia. Russian guards guarded the King in his palace even after he left the Russian legation.\nChina's defeat precipitated an increase in railway construction in the country, as foreign powers demanded China make railway concessions.\n\nIn 1898, Russia signed a 25-year lease on the Liaodong Peninsula and proceeded to set up a naval station at Port Arthur. Although that infuriated the Japanese, they were more concerned with the Russian encroachment in Korea than that in Manchuria. Other powers, such as France, Germany and Britain, took advantage of the situation in China and gained land, port, and trade concessions at the expense of the decaying Qing dynasty. Qingdao was acquired by Germany, Guangzhouwan by France, and Weihaiwei and the New Territories by Britain.Tensions between Russia and Japan would increase in the years after the First Sino-Japanese War. During the Boxer Rebellion, an eight-member international force was sent to suppress and quell the uprising; Russia sent troops into Manchuria as part of this force. After the suppression of the Boxers, the Russian government agreed to vacate the area. However, by 1903, it had actually increased the size of its forces in Manchuria.\nNegotiations between the two nations (1901\u20131904) to establish mutual recognition of respective spheres of influence (Russia over Manchuria and Japan over Korea) were repeatedly and intentionally stalled by the Russians. They felt that they were strong and confident enough not to accept any compromise and believed Japan would not go to war against a European power. Russia also had intentions to use Manchuria as a springboard for further expansion of its interests in the Far East. In 1903, Russian soldiers began construction of a fort at Yongnampo but stopped after Japanese protests.In 1902, Japan formed an alliance with Britain, the terms of which stated that if Japan went to war in the Far East and that a third power entered the fight against Japan, then Britain would come to the aid of the Japanese. This was a check to prevent Germany or France from intervening militarily in any future war with Russia. Japan sought to prevent a repetition of the Triple Intervention that deprived it of Port Arthur. The British reasons for joining the alliance were to check the spread of Russian expansion into the Pacific area, to strengthen Britain's focus on other areas, and to gain a powerful naval ally in the Pacific.\nIncreasing tensions between Japan and Russia were a result of Russia's unwillingness to compromise and the prospect of Korea falling under Russia's domination, therefore coming into conflict with and undermining Japan's interests. Eventually, Japan was forced to take action. This would be the deciding factor and catalyst that would lead to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of China\nHistory of Japan\nHistory of Korea\nHistory of Taiwan\nMilitary history of China\nMilitary history of Japan\nSino-Japanese relations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\u7a0b\u6620\u8679\ufe30\u5f9e\"\u7248\u756b\u4e8b\u4ef6\"\u5230\u300a\u4e2d\u570b\u5411\u897f\u884c\u9032\u300bPeter Perdue \u6fee\u5fb7\u57f9\u548c\u4e2d\u570b\u7576\u4ee3\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9 (in Chinese)\nDetailed account of the naval Battle of the Yalu River by Philo Norton McGiffen\nUnder the Dragon Flag \u2013 My Experiences in the Chino-Japanese War by James Allan\nPrint exhibition at MIT\nThe Sinking of the Kowshing \u2013 Captain Galsworthy's Report\nSinoJapaneseWar.com A detailed account of the Sino-Japanese War\nThe Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895: as seen in prints and archives (British Library/Japan Center for Asian Historical Records)",

        "wiki": "Korean Englishman (\uc601\uad6d\ub0a8\uc790) is a YouTube channel created by Josh Carrott and Ollie Kendal. It includes content in Korean and English (with subtitles in both languages) describing the reactions of British people to aspects of Korean culture and food. The channel initially introduced Korean food to their British friends who never tasted it before, most famously introducing fire noodles to their friends and challenged them to eat it in one of their videos. It later became the first start of Fire Noodle Challenge.The channel introduced a variety Korean food to celebrities in the form of short interviews, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Tom Holland, Pom Klementieff, Ryan Reynolds, Will Smith,  David Beckham and two actors from Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Taron Egerton and Mark Strong.At first, the channel mostly had Korean viewers, but now has a more global audience.In the beginning, Kendal was rarely seen in the videos, mainly in charge of filming and editing, while his friend Carrott (an Englishman who lived in Korea) served as the main host of the show. Over time, Kendal started to appear more often and now co-hosts many of the videos. Kendal, Carrott's best friend and his \u201cfirst wife\u201c, is now many\u2019s favorite and is loved by the channel\u2019s subscribers. \n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nJoshua Daryl Carrott was born in England to Daryl and Maureen Carrott (n\u00e9e Moon). He has a brother named Jordan. When he was 12, Carrott's family moved from England to Qingdao, China due to his father's work.

He used to primarily contribute behind the camera for Korean Englishman initially, but now appears on camera quite often for both channels, especially Jolly. Kendal is loved and adored by the audience of both channels for his personality and humor.\n\n\n=== Family: ===\nHenry Kendal (Kendal's father)  is a Pastor at St. Barnabas Church since 2015. He was ordained in the Church of England having studied variously at London Bible College (now London School of Theology), Oak Hill College and North Thames Ministerial Training College. He is a regular speaker at New Wine and in many places around the world. His has written a book called \u201cThe Wind Blows Wherever it Pleases.\u201d Henry is a popular appearance on the channel. He also enjoys spending time with his family, walking in the country, riding quad bike, playing real tennis and eating cheese. He has 10.3 thousand followers on his Instagram @olliesfather.\nKendal's mother's name is Jane. She has not been featured on his Instagram or Youtube channel, but has been mentioned several times. Kendal has a younger brother called Patrick Kendal and a younger sister. He has 10.3 thousand followers on his instagram @olliesfather.\nElizabeth Anne Kendal, popularly called Lizzie, is Kendal's wife. He met her in high school and was married to her at the age of 21. Lizzie Kendal is an artist and museum and gallery learning facilitator based in London. She has a background in youth and children's work, particularly with refugees and migrants.

(Priest + Commando)'.\n\n\n== Jolly ==\nJolly (stylized as JOLLY) started more as a smaller channel of Korean Englishman. Unlike Korean Englishman, the newer channel Jolly, started in 2015, which represents a portmanteau of their names Josh and Ollie as well as the English word \"Jolly\" as it is, is equally co-hosted by the two with Kendal taking a more prominent role on the screen, as the co-host, compared to their main channel. While the style of the videos on the Korean Englishman channel has a higher production value than Jolly, Jolly was created to have a more communicative and personal feel to viewers, more casually through experimental contents in shorter and simpler videos. Jolly is also different from Korean Englishman as it is seasonal shows whereas the latter is often a themed series of videos.While JOLLY is a mix of Mukbang (eating broadcasts), reaction, interviews with famous celebrities, mail/box opening, and vlogging channel, Korean Englishman focuses on the Korean culture, having people come to Korea to experience the food and customs, or Carrott and crew travelling to other countries to experience what Korean food is like in other countries, or Carrott introducing Korean food and culture to famous people, friends, family, loved ones from his home in England, in Korean-styled restaurants in London, or in the English public.\nUnlike Korean Englishman, JOLLY episodes are divided into seasons, from Season 1 to Season 12 (as of January 2020), each season being indicated by a unique arrangement of 5 colors below the big \"JOLLY\" text during the introduction. Episode numbers are indicated with Roman Numerals. As of 25 August 2020, JOLLY is on Season 12, Episode 188 (CLXXXVIII), where Josh and Ollie (Carrott, Kendal) try the army rations of the Bundeswehr. JOLLY is also where Kendal learns Korean (Hangeul), in their playlist of 35 videos.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to KoreanEnglishman at Wikimedia Commons",

Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas.

In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nS16 Rongwei Expressway (Rongcheng-Weifang)\nS19 Longqing Expressway (Longkou-Qingdao)\nS21 Xinwei Expressway (Xinhe-Weifang)\nS24 Weiqing Expressway (Weihai-Qingdao)Other than Expressways, there are also National Highways that pass through or begin in Qingdao. National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).The Orient Ferry connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The New Golden Bridge II operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the Blue Sea Ferry operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.Qingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, 23 km (14 mi) away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\n\n=== Intercity rail ===\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin. T The fastest train between Qingdao and Beijing is G206 / G205 times, 2 hours and 58 minutes neededDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses as of 2012.There are also 136 trolleybuses as of 2012. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (\u9752\u5c9b\u5361), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. After that, all public transportation companies use Qingdaotong Card, the last company started to use this card is Zhenqing bus company located in The West Coast New Area of Qingdao (original Huangdao Distinct) in 2019.\nNon air-conditioned buses cost 1 yuan (excluding the tunnel bus), The volume of road passenger transport approaches 737 million per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus (\u65e5\u65b0\u5df4\u58eb)' is also known in China.\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of 54.7 km (34.0 mi) of subway line 3 was completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for 231.5 km (143.8 mi) in future. As of end of May 2018, the system has an operating length of 170 km (110 mi), lines in operation including Line 2, Line 3, Line 11, and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\n\nQingdao Tram, her official name is: Modern tram demonstration line of Chengyang District, Qingdao, is a tram system operating in Chengyang District, Qingdao, China. It opened in 2016. The Qingdao Public Transport Group Rail Bus Co., Ltd. is responsible for operation and management. The system is only composed of 1 bus line.\n\n\n== Military ==\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThere are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898\u20131914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R. Lilley, U.S. diplomat\nMa Jian (\u9a6c\u5efa)\nXiao Hong (\u8427\u7ea2)\nXiao Jun (\u8427\u519b)\nDuanmu Hongliang (\u7aef\u6728\u857b\u826f)\nErin Pizzey, (was born in Qingdao)\nLi Zhaoxing (\u674e\u8087\u661f)\nZhang Ruimin (\u5f20\u745e\u654f)\nVictoria Song (\u5b8b\u831c, f(x))\nHuang Zitao (\u9ec4\u5b50\u97ec, musician, actor)\nHuang Bo (\u9ec4\u6e24)\nZhang Jike (\u5f20\u7ee7\u79d1)\nGao Fenghan (\u9ad8\u51e4\u7ff0)\nToshiro Mifune (was born in Qingdao)\nLi Cunxin (\u674e\u5b58\u4fe1)\nHuang Xiaoming (\u9ec4\u6653\u660e)\nChen Hao (\u9648\u597d)\nXia Yu (\u590f\u96e8)\nFan Bingbing (\u8303\u51b0\u51b0, born in Qingdao)\nBai Baihe (\u767d\u767e\u5408)\nHao Haidong (\u90dd\u6d77\u4e1c)\nWang Dong (\u738b\u680b, Chinese Footballer)\nZhang Juanjuan (\u5f20\u5a1f\u5a1f ,archer)\nMalcolm H.

Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u8bdd; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo hu\u00e0) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard Mandarin, most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nSeafood is a typical delicacy of the coastal city, divided into two categories: \"Great Seafood\" including sea cucumbers, abalones, shark's fin, prawns, crabs, conch, and some big fish, and \"Little Seafood\" comprising squid, shrimps, octopus, oysters, razor clams, clams, periwinkles, yellow croakers, etc.\nThe distinctive cuisine of the area is Lu Cai, the Shandong regional style.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nNotable festivals include:\n\nQingdao International Horticultural Exposition 2014 is the biggest international fair that has been held in the history of the city.\nQingdao International Beer Festival in August/September, held annually since 1991.\n\n\n== Media ==\nQingdao previously had a large German community and a German garrison, so three German newspapers operated in Qingdao. German papers included Deutsch-Asiatische Warte (traditional Chinese: \u6cf0\u6771\u53e4\u4eca\u9451; simplified Chinese: \u6cf0\u4e1c\u53e4\u4eca\u9274; pinyin: T\u00e0id\u014dng G\u01d4j\u012bn Ji\u00e0n; weekly newspaper published until 1906, included Die Welt des Ostens, Altes und Neues aus Asiens drei Kaiserreichen, a cultural supplement), the Tsingtauer Neueste Nachrichten and the Kiautschou Post (a daily paper published from 1908 to 1912, referring to the Kiautschou (Jiaozhou) Bay concession).

It was originally a residential area for the Germans built when Qingdao was a German protectorate (1897-1914).  Each street is lined with a single species of tree and many street names are colloquially known by the trees that line them. Along the streets are houses built in a variety of European architectural styles. Badaguan is bordered on the west by No. 1 Beach and on the east by No. 3 Beach. Badaguan is a popular destination for wedding photography.  One can often see dozens of newlywed-couples being photographed along Badaguan's shoreline and greenspace.\nNext to Badaguan, on the south end of No. 2 Beach, is a large rocky outcropping on which a stone Russian villa was constructed. Built in 1932, Huashi Lou (\u82b1\u77f3\u697c) combines Greek, Gothic, and Gothic influences throughout its five storey hulk. It is constructed from marble and stone and features a large turret and a multicolored outer face which inspired the locals' nickname for the structure, \"the colorful rock building\". It also contains a passageway which Chiang Kai-shek used to get from the building to the seashore.\n\n\n== The streets of Badaguan ==\nThese streets run north-south:\n\nZijingguan Road (\u7d2b\u8346\u5173\u8def)\nNingwuguan Road (\u5b81\u6b66\u5173\u8def)\nShaoguan Road (\u97f6\u5173\u8def)These streets run east-west:\n\nWushengguan Road (\u6b66\u80dc\u5173\u8def)\nJiayuguan Road (\u5609\u5cea\u5173\u8def)\nHanguguan Road (\u51fd\u8c37\u5173\u8def)\nZhengyangguan Road (\u6b63\u9633\u5173\u8def)\nLinhuaiguan Road (\u4e34\u6dee\u5173\u8def)\nJuyongguan Road (\u5c45\u5eb8\u5173\u8def)\nShanhaiguan Road (\u5c71\u6d77\u5173\u8def)\n\n\n== Festival on Badaguan ==\nAn annual festival of \"Badaguan Beer Festival\" is held from August 10 to 25, during which period there is such a variety of holiday events as musical instruments performance, dance performance, and beer-drinking competition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tourist attractions in China\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n. \"Badaguan.\" China Connection Tours.

The first line, Line 3 (north section) began operation on December 16, 2015.\n\n\n== Lines in operation ==\n\n\n=== Line 2 ===\n\nConstruction on Line 2 began in 2012, and the completed line will comprise 22 stations, with a total length of 25.2 km. Line 2 began passenger service on December 10, 2017 between Zhiquan Road station and Licun Park station. The western section from Zhiquan Road station to Taishan Road station opened on December 16, 2019.\n\n\n=== Line 3 ===\n\nThe construction of the first line, Line 3, began on November 30, 2009. With 13 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) of funding, the line comprises 22 stations, with a total length of 24.8 km. The northern half of Line 3 began trial passenger operation on December 16, 2015, and the southern half opened a year later, on December 18, 2016.\n\n\n=== Line 11 ===\n\nPhase I of Line 11 between Miaoling Road station and Qiangu Mountain station, which extends from Laoshan District to Jimo District, with 21 stations and 54 km of track, began operation on April 23, 2018.\n\n\n=== Line 13 ===\n\nPhase I and Phase II of Line 13 between Jinggangshan Road and Dongjiakou Railway Station started operation on December 26, 2018, with 21 stations and 66.813 km of track.\n\n\n== History ==\nQingdao proposed a subway system in 1935, making it one of the first cities in China to propose a subway system. The proposed network was 42 km long and ran underground in the city center while elevated in the suburbs. However, the plan never gained traction due to turmoil from the Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War. Planning resumed in 1989 only to be stopped again in 1995 after a national suspension of subway projects was declared due to worries of high costs and financial debts. Repeated attempts to gain approval for subway construction were unsuccessful until 2009 when it was finally approved by the NDRC and a test section of Line 3 started construction in July.\n\n\n== Construction and plans ==\nThe 2013-2021 construction plan of Qingdao Metro was approved by National Development and Reform Commission in April 2016.More transfer stations such as Taidong station and Liaoyang East Road station will be built, providing the citizens with more choices in transportation.\n\n\n=== Line 1 ===\nAnother line, Line 1, is due to be completed in 2020. It will temporarily run along one of the sections of Line 7, from Xingguo Road station to Dongguozhuang station.\n\n\n=== Line 4 ===\nLine 4 has been under construction since 2016, and is due to be completed in 2022 from People's Hall station to Dahedong station. It will bring much convenience to Qingdao citizens once the line begins operation.\n\n\n=== Line 6 ===\nConstruction for Line 6 started at December 16, 2019. Line 6 is a 30 km line with 21 underground stations.\n\n\n=== Line 8 ===\nThe northern section will open in 2020, and the remaining section will open in 2021.\n\n\n=== Line 2 (western extension) ===\nA 3.84 km (2.39 mi) extension from Taishan Road to Lundu (Ferry Terminal) started construction on October 26, 2019.\n\n\n=== Plans ===\nAccording to the published plans, ultimately there will be 16 lines in total (plus two branch lines) with a combined length of 836 km. All work is scheduled to be finished prior to 2050.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of metro systems\n\n\n== References ==\n\n$4.3 billion budget to boost Qingdao subway construction\n\n\n== External links ==\nQingdao Metro construction (in Chinese)\nQingdao Metro construction presentation (in Chinese)\nQingdao at UrbanRail.net",

          "We did not expect much when we started our self-organized tour to the Laoshan mountains. Nevertheless, we were pleasantly surprised by the scenic spots, nature and beautiful views. Overall - the area is quite well maintained. At one spot, one can take a cable car to get uphill -",
          "Snow capped peaks in winter! Perfect time to visit with barely any visitors. Spectacular views from the top! Great for hikers. We caught the 104 bus which starts at Taidong and travels down to the Xianggang West and Xianggang East Road (the West road becomes the East Road)",
          "A nice drive from Qingdao along the waterfront to the top of the hill where there were some tea rooms available for tasting.I recommend 4-5 hrs to visit this place as there are some areas that we did get to especially the photos spots.Be aware there\u2019s an entrance fee and another",
          "Unless you are a hiking lover. Though the organisation provide several transportation for visitor, but you need to keep on changing the shuttle bus & cable car. It may me feel like riding the transport more than seeing & enjoy the scenery.",
          "I visited the Taiqing Area. The entrance fee was 130 yuan including all the bus fares in the area. The entrance fee for Taiqing Temple was 27 yuan. I also paid the ropeway fare 80 yuan for a round trip. I expected Laoshan was the best tourist attraction in Qingdao and it was,",
          "The park is beautiful and clean, with breathtaking views of mountains and open ocean. Coming from the US, it is striking how similar it looks to Southern California landscapes. The Taoist temples and the huge statue of Laozi (the founder of Taoism) pointing to heaven and Earth,",
          "There are three 3,000ft plus peaks in the park, The highest one, Jufeng Peak, is closed but one can climb Lingqi peak in the Jufeng region - great views and an easy climb up steps",
          "This is a very large national park, with interesting rock formations and ancient Taoist temples. There are three main entrances, South, East and North. The South entrance is the one to head for if you just have a day. From there you can see the largest temple in the park, hike",
          "We booked a taxi for one day RMB400 to make a trip to Laoshan Scenic area and city tour in the afternoon. The air is so fresh and the garden is so green almost without any pollution. I'm not sure if joining a tour group locally be fun but It is definitely a nice place to visit",
          "This is a beautiful location. I recently visited Laoshan Mountain with a business colleague and her family. The climb was a good workout and the views breathtaking. Great way to spend some free time while in Qingdao.",
          "Unspeakable beauty of mountains and winding stairs through the forest with temples, tea plantations and water falls. A must see!",
          "Went twice during my short stay as I figured I can always do the other town touristy sites easily in my next visit. Stayed in Lichang area and got a cab to a small town nearby whereby we waited for public bus to take us up the mountain Laoshan. Pass by alot of cherry",
          "I was fortunate enough to have a day trip to the Dao monastery and then to the mountain area. It was wonderful and such a blend of ancient temples and modern highways and old traditions and high tech processes. We had a lovely guide who was able to help our group understand",
          "On February 17th, 2019, my dad, mom and I went to climb a famous mountain called Laoshan Mountain in Qing Dao. We lived in downtown of the city, where is about 30 kilometers from the mountain. There are buses to get to the mountain every day. To save time, we spent about 50 Yuan",
          "This area is huge, but you might need Chinese tour guide to take you into the more intricate places. First, the Dao Temples. These are literally from 2000 plus years ago. It is not fake because the trees the old temple guards planted are still there, more than 2000 years old.",
          "Good for a couple of hours of exercise but not particularly interesting. There are a few nice beachside restaurants which might be worthwhile.",
          "Located an hour bus ride away, this serene park offers a great escape from busy city life. The walk started from the cost where trees hang down to the clear sea. We only hiked a portion of the park and rode the cable car, but still it was an hour and half hike with most",
          "Came here on 2 separate occasions as Mount Lao has a few scenic areas. Once was to 'Yangkou' \u4ef0\u53e3 which is about 160 rmb/an hour by taxi from the Hyatt. After getting a ticket for 90 rmb, you can either take the chair lift up (pay extra at the ticket office) or just hike up which",
          "Worth a visit to walk around on a day when the air is fresh! This is the most beautiful area in a beautiful city.",
          "we got our hotel to reccommend and area, the one with the cable car and the Tao temple. Went by taxi, plenty to take on way home but had to haggle over price. With our destination written in chinese we found our way to the ticket office [toilets excellent] then just folloed",
          "As my friend in Qingdao brought me to go by driving, but we have to stop at the entry and buy the entry ticket with their bus service to continue the visit in Laoshan, otherwise you can hire a local tourist guide who is holding permit to let you drive your car in and can save",
          "If you love nature then this is a must go place, a breath taking view beholds you once you are at the top.... You don't wanna come down :-)",
          "Very good experience, very beautiful scenic area...Did a little hiking, then took the air carts to the top",
          "What a view and eye opener if you are a first time Qingtao visitor.Very historic and lots to see and do",
          "It is more than just mountain. The drive from city there was easy and scenic with views of ocean and tea plantation along the way. A lot of spots to catch the spectacular views. They have cable car to bring tourist up to the hill for more views. There is also a big",
          "That\u2019s the fastest way to the top. We were there on a Sunday so it\u2019s quite crowded but not to the point of it being uncomfortable. At the base have a choice of walking or taking the bus up to the cable car area. We bought a bus ticket and the bus ride up the mountain is well",
          "Ten years since I was here, they build up a bus terminal so that all people must board a bus to reach the cable car station, and take the cable car to the top. At the top station there are 3000 steps to reach the peak. Or choose a different path for a hike around the mountain.",
          "Very organised scenic location. Need to use the scenic tour bus for all sight seeings. Almost all Drop off points is a short distant from the scenic spot. Strict n high tech check on each entrance using the bar code scan on the ticket and our finger print! Is a taoist temple",
          "A must see. Beautiful scenery, stunning walks. If you are in Qingdao you have to take the time to go on one of the tours, it is well worth it. Be prepared for some steep climbs, the views are definitely worth every step.",
          "The scenery is really beautiful. However, transportation is not that convenient. Each sceneric spot quite far apart from each other. So hiring car is preferred.",
          "Beautiful mountains with cable cars and walks made out of concrete. it can be quite crowded. the tao-ist temple and the buddhist temple are quite beautiful and worth the visit.",
          "Need to go if you go to Qingdao for a holiday. It's about 30-40 minutes from north side of Qingdao. There's multiple scenic areas to travel through and confusing for foriegners. Recommend going with someone who can read Chinese or go with a guided tour. The park buses will",
          "I would advise healthy walkers to walk up and get the chairlift down but you can easily completely skip the chairlift as the walk has great views itself and is not particularly challenging. There are tea farms around and many little temples and things to see. Make sure to pack",
          "It is totally worth spending a day there. Laoshan itself is huge, i yhink you need two to three days to see everything and climb everywhere. But one day is enough to enjoy scenic views of sea a mountains. Loved it. From Qingdao take bus 304, its only 4yuan, from Laoshan tourist",
          "My plan was to go by taxi to the laoshan area, have a walk at one of the scenic areas and then go back by bus to my hotel at CBD. Luckily and without intention the taxi driver took me for a full tour there, which at the end was very usefull and let me see several of the scenic",
          "When we went to Laoshan we had no idea what was ahead of us, and wish we would have had more time! There are several peaks and temples to visit, all with a bus route which takes you to the base of each area. Once arriving, you'll want to buy your all access ticket which is",
          "This was our first weekend in Qingdao and we decided to climb the Laoshan mountain. Buses are available to the Laoshan scenic area base from around the city. Once there pick up tickets for what you want to do. There\u2019s a cable car option but it was under maintenance the week we",
          "There are something like 4 entrances to hike the various peaks around Laoshan. That can be somewhat confusing if you don't speak Chinese. Either way, bring good shoes because you'll need to hike up 3000 meters or pay around 40 yuan per person for one way up or down on the",
          "We went specifically to visit TiaQing Temple, and were not disappointed. Temple is so interesting, and beautiful. The views are amazing. We Spent almost 4 hrs. At the temple.",
          "Taking a 45 min taxi ride, we arrived at this seaside rocky mountain with temples and fishing village. We hiked up 20 minute to the lowest scenic spot and the view was already spectacular. Also visited Hwa Yen temple and it was simple but elegant with nice pine and and bamboos",
          "Nice scenic, small temples for a day escursion out of the city. Bring your picnic along with and good trecking shoes",
          "The view, the atmosphere was spellbinding. Chinese architecture at its best. A commanding view all around. There\u2019s a nice cafe shop at entrance which is good during this cold winter.",
          "The Laoshan area is very large and we only spent half a day to visit 2 places. It was very pretty and gentle walk. We visited a buddhist and taoist temple. Both were very pretty with nice view of mountain and sea. The area is vast so we had to rent a driver. Be warned though",
          "We took the cable car to reach half way of the Jufeng peak and then climbed. Remember to take water with you, though there is a small shop at the peak. The view from the peak was brilliant and worth all the hard work you did to climb the mountain. Must watch one in Laoshan..",
          "We hiked this mountain as a company outing and everyone had a good time. The hike itself is pretty easy as there is a walkway with steps the entire way. When we went the waterfall at the end was nearly dry, so it was somewhat underwhelming. However, the bridge right before it",
          "Gotta tell the taxi to go to the tourist center. From there you'll need to pick a route and get your tickets. The route we took was the Southern Route. Head out to the buses and they'll drop you off at a doaist temple attraction where you'll need to pay for admission. We opted",
          "Take in as much as you can of the road that hugs the coast. Takes you thru small villages. There will be lots of traffic jams in the busy season ... just pic a place with your favorite view (there will be many!) and relax while looking our over the sea. Many places run shrimp",
          "The setting was beautiful and interesting, but as english-only speaking and reading Canadians, we had great difficulty figuring out where to go and what to see. We took the cable car up the mountain, and then walked the very many stairs to the lookout - it was a nice view. A",
          "My trip to laoshan was a very tiring climb and pretty dissapointing. I dont find the view that great. I personally would prefer city tours as qingdao offer many historical attraction.",
          "The tourist set up at Laoshan Scenic Area is massive. We took a taxi from the CBD to the large tourist centre, from where you need to pick a route and buy your tickets. It's the first time we had our fingerprints taken to enter a scenic area, so that was a surprise. Ticket and",
          "The shortest path to the topmost viewing platform is 5000 steps. We took a cable car to go up (35 Yuan one way, 60 yuan return). Went through the caves - which are not worth going through - they are narrow - you need some flashlight (phone's light is good enough) to reach the",
          "We took the gondola to the top and ended walking down the entire way. Had we not done that we only would have seen a portion of the beauty Laoshan has to offer.",
          "We arrived the day after a heavy rain storm caused flash flooding in Qingdao. Therefore, the streams were flowing nicely. We saw busloads of visitors (individual cars are discouraged. Our escorts knew a guard who let us drive up to \"visit\" a fiend. The Laoshan is a government",
          "Wonderful temple site to visit on a very steep location. there is an amazingly tall statue of the religious leader that dominates the site. there are lots of steps so may not suit everyone to get to the top but worth it if you can do it. Apparently this is one area of this large",
          "Lao Shan is the mountainous area to the east of the city and well worth going to once the noise of the city's traffic gets too much for you. It is home to a Taoist temple amongst its wooded slopes. All very contemplative and peaceful. Excellent views at the very top looking out",
          "I went to Laoshan on a hot summer day. To my delight, Laoshan was quite cool, and was very comfortable. It's a great place to hike with beautiful scenery, and is also an important Daoist area. Scenery (5/5): Very stunning views from the mountainside! From the trails, you can",
          "Laoshan is considered the second most sacred Daoist site after the White Cloud Temple in Beijing. As such, there are eight gates at the top that you can do a loop around. Unfortunately, when we went (June 2017), six of the eight gates were not accessible. However they plan to",
          "Only had an afternoon to Laoshan scenic area and did the cable car ride and hike to top of mountain. It was magnificent and well worth the trip. About an hour from the CBD so you really need at least a full day with an early start. A guide would be recommended for more",
          "It takes around an hour to get there from downtown by car. Public bus is also available, but runs around two hours. Mountain itself is not too high, climbing is relatively easy since route is well-made. There are two main ways to the top, one of them leads you on the side with",
          "This scenic area is away from the city center, we were on an organized group tour, therefore getting there was not a problem. The route from the city center to the scenic area was beautiful, lined with well attended shrubs, trees and flowers. A transfer to a smaller coach",
          "If you are visiting Qingdao - sailing city, you do not want to miss its top attraction - Trekking through Mount Lao (L\u00e1oSh\u0101n \u5d02\u5c71) Scenic Area. It was an arduous journey but it was worth it. I will always cherish the breathtaking view of city, sea & mountains & the walking through",
          "1.5hrs from downtown hotels by car. Take the cable car to the upper mountain then walk the rest to where there was a Shrine, but only the Buddist cave after the WW2 Japanese invasion destroyed it. To take the cable car you need to scan your fingerprint to enter and same on way",
          "Located pretty far from the centre of the city, expect to travel by bus or cab 3 hours or so. Like the Badaling Great Wall of China, this scenic area is located in the mountains surrounded by trees and vegetations, very nice to see all the amazing green, fresh plants around this",
          "About 1 1/2 hours drive from Qingdao is the Laoshan Senic Area. along with stunning scenes and great walks, the area is also famous for it's green tea. There are \"quaint\" local restaurants, including some with tea tasting facilities. This is a place where you could spend days",
          "We visited there during Spring Festival. We were anxious about that pubic transport could work, however, there were many local public buses to the visiter center. In the visiter center, foreign people have to show their passport. To pass a gate, you have to register your",
          "Must visit place while in Qingdao....even by the shore, the mountain it self bring fresher air in you...good place to learn history with enjoyable scenery....",
          "lao shan is simply a great visit - I would visit this mountain quite often - running with hash house harriers, hiking with a walking group and biking with friends around the mountain roads whatever takes your fancy this a great place to spend a day - particularly when the",
          "As a foreign exchange student studying in Qingdao, I can say that Laoshan Mountain will be a highlight of your visit to Qingdao. If the smog isn't bad and the weather is comfortable, a hike up the mountain will give you some breath-taking views of the ocean and other mountains.",
          "I've been a longtime fan of mountain destinations in China, having been to many of the big ones in the past: Mt. Huang (where Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was filmed), Mt. Hua (home of steep drops and dangerous trails), Mt. Emei, several trips to Mt. Qingcheng, Mt. Yulong, and",
          "Beautiful area to visit. There are a few hikes you can take to enjoy the scenic area. We had a local join us for the tour.",
          "It a beautiful day when I went to Laoshan in the morning. it got fantasic view and fresh air on top of the mountain make me feel good after long walk(aroud 2 hrs.). However,It hard for a person who do not speak Chinese because no English speaker there.",
          "Most of the days, the air condition of Qingdao is too bad. You can't see anything clearly at the mountain.",
          "Laoshan is very huge, for me who do no like to go hiking i feel it is not bad, not feel so tried, i am more focus on the shop which behind the hiking load to sell the tea leaf, i think the tea taste not bad. the view is grandiose, but we don not walk around the whole mountain,",
          "If the weather is clear and fine, visiting Laoshan is in my opinion the best activity. It offers many walking trails which are not too challenging and yet provides many breathtaking views. You could also drop by one of the tea plantations and taste the famous Laoshan green and",
          "When you see the Laoshan mountain from the airplane it looks majestic. Got to go I said to myself.... Well I was running out of time and decided to stay an extra day and visit this area. Our guide was from the area and drove us right to the base of the park. It did not look too",
          "our friends took us to the Laushan national park, then took their park provided bus to go inside the park, the scenery is stunning and nice for a family outing",
          "Left Qingdo city centre in a car around 7.30am, arrived in Lao Shan close to 10am and hiked for over an hour. The weather was great ...sunny+blue skies with red and orangey leaves. Air was refreshing. Toilet facilities were decent. We made additional stops in the area post our",
          "It's a great place to escape the city though it can be quite a trek to get here. Try to go on a clear day to get the best views.",
          "This is definitely a must-see if you are in Qingdao. The view from the mountain is gorgeous and it is also worthwhile to drive around the area for great views of the sea, fishing villages, tea fields, ancient temples and, of course, mountains. If you are traveling on your own,",
          "Don't ever visit on a Chinese Public Holiday! Also, make certain to check which area you want to go to before departing as there are numerous ways of getting to each area faster. We spent 3hours just getting from the main Tourist Centre to the area we wanted to visit, 1) because",
          "Been there a few times, rebuilt temples, steps instead of trails, constant pollution. Mountains would have been beautiful 80 years ago. Culturally important to Taoism.",
          "Nice place to go for an afternoon. Very popular for Chinese tourists.. I was missing the \"real\" nature.. everything was paved.. everywhere they take admission... but normal in China...",
          "While you in Qingdao, do not skip to visit this beautiful mountain, as the mountain has a beautiful view and rock formation , take your time to walk till the peak and you could see a beautiful view of surrounded area but the waterfall has a less water during our visit",
          "man-made trail in good condition, good green outdoor activity. A total walk of about 4 hours to complete the entire trail. Unfortunately, due to the drought, water level is very low, don't expect to see much of the running water through the creeks.",
          "Good trip around Qingdao to enjoy nature besides the city life. Definately recommended to stay there for a whole day, there are also cable cars to go up the hills to enjoy a beautiful view!",
          "This place is truly beautiful. The contrast of ocean and mountains is truly breath-taking. Tea is a big deal here, and the eye-wateringly green tea plants stretch on as far as the eyes can see. There is a lot of delicious local seafood available. Don't leave without making",
          "We took a taxi to laoshan, starting at 1:30pm and got back around 7 to our hotel in the city. By meter, it cost us about 670 rmb. Supposedly you can book a car for 600 flat for the day. A very nice route, on the way there, we stopped for a famous huge Shandong mantou (steamed",
          "Their are many entrances and different prices to enter into the Laoshan scenic area. the best suggestion is to buy the 130RMB admission and will include a bus that shuttles you between views within the scenic area. You need to show your ticket each time you enter the shuttle",
          "Our plan was to hike Laoshan. We did not realize how vast the mountain was. The area we were had very little english and we were quite confused as to where we get off the bus and where we could hike. We were often told we could not hike and would have to take the cable car. Very",
          "We lived in Qingdao for six months. We got our water from Laoshan. We noticed sodas were made with Laoshan water. They grow a famous green tea in Laoshan. And the mountain range is great for hiking and exploring. With the air quality in China being poor, it was refreshing",
          "This is a popular spot for Chinese tourists so perhaps midweek is better. We went after a dry spell with the river bed dry so the 18 pools and waterfalls were all imaginary. The rocks and cliff features are quite remarkable, and this is the home of Taoism so you can imagine",
          "Lao Shan is a really lovely scenic area filled with mountains and a beautiful view of the ocean. The steps to the top of the mountain can take a while to climb, so come prepared, and be sure to check the weather, as well. You can also go to the top of the mountain via cable car,",
          "We were lucky enough to be taken here by our hosts and had a great opportunity to see some spectacular scenery. The road in tracks the coastline with views of the sea and the rocky shoreline. We took a tour around the Taoist temple with a guide who offered to escort us and",
          "I would say that I was a bit disappointed. It seemed like the view *might* have been awesome, but it was so foggy that I couldn't see much. And this was in June! But I imagine that if the weather were clearer, I would feel much better about it... Pros: -The air is clean, and if",
          "Laoshan is a scenic area well worth visiting. We took the bus up the coast line, stopped by the sea front and then continue to the north part. Cable car to the top, explored a narrow cave on the way to Heavens roof. Amazing landscape, beautiful views!",
          "Laosham is a very good place for nature lovers. Several trails climbing up the hills. There are a lot spots to see. Some of them have taoist temples with great view of the montains and the sea. Be prepared for a long hill climbing up besides some peaks have cable cars it does",
          "I came here in 2008 with a local guide who was escorting me around and thought this was great place - loved climbing the steps to the temples near the top and ringing the bell. This time, I had a paid for guide who seemed to know very little, didn't speak English and took me to",
          "It is near to the sea, so you can enjoy the view of both the mountain and the sea. There are also some historic relics you can visit. overall, it's a nice place for relaxing yourselves.",
          "Friends took us up to the Laoshan Scenic Area. I feel like it was only about an hours drive from Qingdao. It is located by the seaside along the coastline. This mountain is spiritual as it is the birthplace of Taoism. It has oddly shaped rocks, ancient trees and super clear",
          "I met Pu Song Ling, China's best-known ghost storyteller on a visit to Laoshan, a forested hilly park outside Qingdao city. It was a cold autumn afternoon when I sat on the stone bench to hear the cautionary tale he told about a certain Mr Wang from Taiyuan city, an idle fellow",
          "This was a unexpected add on to my trip and was well worth it. The scenery is amaizing. The routes are well marked and well kept. What a stunning place. If you are in the area its well worth a visit.",
          "I went during labour day weekend, so I was expecting it to be crowded. What I didn't expect was for the people working around the mountain to be rude, refusing to answer simple questions and for attraction I hiked to, to require an additional ticket, after spending 130 rmb",
          "This place used to be really good when it was less developed. Right now lots of dishonest businesses going on and lots of trash everywhere. NOT recommended.",
          "There is a cable car that you can take to the summit during the warmer months (I think it's closed in Winter), if you are short on time. Otherwise, the walk is over an hour (one way), depending on fitness/pace, but the path is fully paved and well maintained. There are quite a",
          "Growing up in America I can remember seeing misty paintings of China. When I arrived in Laoshan the paintings from my childhood were real. This is dream land, with miles of stairs to hundreds of temples you can not miss this.",
          "The laoshan area is situated at the outskirt of the city. Therefore, we booked a van for the whole day n the driver drove us there which took around 50mins drive from the city. The admission fee is RMB60 unless you are 70 years old an above..Then it is free admission. The hike",
          "What an amazing place - scenic, refreshing, challenging and more importantly a must for any visitor to Qingdao. Laoshan is pure natural beauty which is not to be missed.",
          "This area is definitely worth a visit as it's an area of scenic coves and old fishing villages. We drove as far as the large and mostly empty visitor center where we were pursued by touts telling us we needed special license which they could provide for us to drive up to the",
          "I went to Shantong; China with my friends. We were recommended by local guide; who is hiking organizer and guide. We appreciate him so much, completely information and guided the easier way to the peak of Laosan. I like many scenic viewpoint there and ancient temple on the hill.",
          "A very scenic and relaxing area with clean fresh air. Laoshan appears to be split into 2 different areas. The first one near the coast includes some very old temples and trees and is an easy walk. Praying Mantis style kung fu is said to have originated here. A bus is need to",

          "Very little English, so either sharpen your Chinese or be prepared to observe and follow the crowd. Ask your hotel how to get to the bus. Make sure you pick the bus that actually makes it all the way to the mountain climb entrance. My bus stopped about 1 mile short, to reverse,",

          "By far the best thing to do in Qingdao if you like hiking, there's the regular trail which is paved or you can do the extreme trail. First, you have to get out of the paved trail and start climbing on the mountain, there's plenty of trails you can follow or make your own,",
          "I expect you have to go there and see this place and enjoy there. A really nice and quiet place. The temple on arrival has a fantastic garden trees. And the view on the top, after 1 hour walk behind the telepheric is nice too. Enjoy your time there.",

          "This is the place to come and chill out for a few hours and recharge your soul and spirits. It's about 2 hours from Qingdao but well worth the trip. Beautiful ancient temples and gardens overlooking the sea. You can't help get a feeling of peace and calm wandering the grounds.",

          "This is a really great historic and also tourist venue. It is a national park on a scenic peninsula, with sources of income from bed and breakfasts, pearls, tea and jade. Lots of investment by the Chinese Government. If you can find an organised tour that would be best, unless",
          "go by 104 bus to the Laoshan mountain bus depot and buy a ticket for your destination. I got a ticket to the temple which included a ride right to the end at Yangchow beach. The temple is ancient but all information and guides are in chinese. Often someone will speak english",

          "A lovely mountain to explore , particularly in the low season. The rocks are beautifully colored and there is plenty of space to explore. I do however resent paying so much to visit the famous scenic spots of China. More freedom to roam along small windy footpaths would make",
          "You can take a look at the central part of this scenic area. But for me the best of this mountain&sea spot are those little villages along the seashore. Spend sometime hiking and you will find all kinds of interesting docks, beaches and little restaurants. What's more, it's free!",

          "On the back side of LaoShan, there are many farmers that will allow you to pick fruit directly from the tree for ~30rmb. As you climb up the hillside you pass old ladies perching on ladders and rapidly harvesting cherries with an expert eye for what's ready to eat today. These",
          "The Laoshan district is large, and this review covers the southern coastal area and the peak of Lao Shan itself. TA has a separate review for the northern Beijiushui waterfall area, which I recommend equally. By bus, get on a 104 or 304 from the centre. It runs the length of",
          "Visited this area during a chilly December. I probably spent what felt like 3-4 hours exploring the area and really enjoyed. Not very crowded and for the most part easy to navigate as it relates to walking around the area. The hike up the mountain was not very difficult - it",

          "The visit to Lao Shan (Mount Lao or \u5d02\u5c71) was very short. If you want to visit the mountain thoroughly, you should go on weekends in non-peak seasons or during the peak season. It is because the connection transport is more frequent and the cable cars between one peak to another",

          "The scenery here is beautiful. It is well worth a visit if you come to Qingdao. The Laoshan area is rather huge so you need to be selective of where you want to go and how much tracking you want to do. We went to the South Gate in a taxi (make sure you insist the driver start",

          "This outing should get four or even five stars as the scenery is beautiful. However the journey up and back to the cable car is one I never wish to experience again. Drivers in China are not known for their safe pleasant driving but this trip takes the biscuit. The minibus drive",
          "We went. What a waste. We got there - very confusing what your ticket acquired. We took shuttle buses to the various sites. No explanation as to why you were kicked off the shuttle buses here or there. Follow the Chinese tourists. Climb stairs. One never saw much. Super dirty",
          "Do not take those tour cabs who offer a ride to laoshan. They will start with a price and then ask for more once it's finished. Once you arrive at laoshan, there's a 5 minutes cable car to the top with fake carvings in rocks and superficial scenery. At the top of the mountain,",
          "I was with a tour group for a conference. After getting our tickets we had a special bus take us to the mountain. Then we climbed stairs the entire way. I never made it to the end. I didn't think it was anything special (after being to Denali and the Rocky Mountains) this was",

          "Typical views from mountain tops... after the cable car ride still must climb like 40mins of vertical steps... Worse still if you're there during China holidays... have to even queue to climb! Can skip if you're not the scenic kind. Save some money on beers!",
          "Nice paths through the mountains & waterfall and great views. Very worth a visit. Bit of a drive from the city, if you speak no Mandarin then best hire a driver for a day ( from \u00a3 40).",

          "Lao Shan or the Lao Mountain is just a mountain rising off the coast line. It is low, unspectacular and nothing special. There is a Dao Temple built with taste unlike many of the ones I seem elsewhere in Chna. The RMB100 fung-fu show is a rip-off. The fortune tellers at the end",
          "Incredibly beautiful. So close to the city, yet it seems a world away. Quiet, peaceful, amazing views. A fantastic walk. I felt like swimming in the gorgeous pools, but not allowed for understandable reasons. Friendly people selling drinks, ice creams, sun hats, and snacks"

        "wiki": "Qingdao Liuting International Airport (IATA: TAO, ICAO: ZSQD) is the main international airport serving the city of Qingdao in Shandong Province, China. It is about 31 km (19 mi) from the city center and serves as a hub for Shandong Airlines, Beijing Capital Airlines and Qingdao Airlines as well as a focus city for China Eastern Airlines. A replacement airport, Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport, is fully complete since mid-2020, but the official opening date has yet to be announced.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 2004 to 2006, the airport underwent an expansion of its terminal as well as adding more parking spaces which was part of its initial 2010 goal to expand Liuting Airport to handle 5.2 million passengers annually or 2400 passengers and almost 120,000 tons of cargo hourly. The runway was also extended to its current length. Its IATA code is used for its former romanized name Tsingtao.In 2018, Qingdao Liuting was the 15th busiest airport in China with 24.53 million passengers. Due to its lack of room to expand as it is being surrounded by the city, in December 2013, the Chinese government approved the construction of Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport which will replace Liuting as Qingdao's main airport by the second half of 2019.Qingdao did not have a non-stop intercontinental air link until 29 March 2016, when Lufthansa's existing service to Frankfurt, Germany via Shenyang was upgraded to a non-stop flight to Frankfurt. Later in the year, Beijing Capital Airlines introduced service to Melbourne, Australia and Vancouver, Canada in early 2017.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe airport is about 31 kilometres (19 mi) north of the city, and connected by taxis, three airport shuttle bus lines (701\u8def, 702\u8def, 703\u8def), two tourism bus lines (Huangdao Special Line, Jiaonan Special Line), and intercity buses to neighboring cities. When open, Line 7 of the Qingdao Metro will connect with the airport, operating trains between Qingdao International Sailing Centre and Bei'an Street, Jimo City.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of airports in China\nChina's busiest airports by passenger traffic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Qingdao Liuting International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nAirport information for ZSQD at World Aero Data.

        "wiki": "Qingdao ([t\u0255\u02b0\u00ed\u014bt\u00e0u]; also spelled Tsingtao; Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b) is a major sub-provincial city in eastern Shandong province, China. Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F).

In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways.

The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years.

It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section.

The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R.

        "wiki": "Qingdao ([t\u0255\u02b0\u00ed\u014bt\u00e0u]; also spelled Tsingtao; Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b) is a major sub-provincial city in eastern Shandong province, China. Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nS16 Rongwei Expressway (Rongcheng-Weifang)\nS19 Longqing Expressway (Longkou-Qingdao)\nS21 Xinwei Expressway (Xinhe-Weifang)\nS24 Weiqing Expressway (Weihai-Qingdao)Other than Expressways, there are also National Highways that pass through or begin in Qingdao. National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).The Orient Ferry connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The New Golden Bridge II operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the Blue Sea Ferry operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.Qingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, 23 km (14 mi) away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\n\n=== Intercity rail ===\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin. T The fastest train between Qingdao and Beijing is G206 / G205 times, 2 hours and 58 minutes neededDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses as of 2012.There are also 136 trolleybuses as of 2012. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (\u9752\u5c9b\u5361), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. After that, all public transportation companies use Qingdaotong Card, the last company started to use this card is Zhenqing bus company located in The West Coast New Area of Qingdao (original Huangdao Distinct) in 2019.\nNon air-conditioned buses cost 1 yuan (excluding the tunnel bus), The volume of road passenger transport approaches 737 million per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus (\u65e5\u65b0\u5df4\u58eb)' is also known in China.\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of 54.7 km (34.0 mi) of subway line 3 was completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for 231.5 km (143.8 mi) in future. As of end of May 2018, the system has an operating length of 170 km (110 mi), lines in operation including Line 2, Line 3, Line 11, and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\n\nQingdao Tram, her official name is: Modern tram demonstration line of Chengyang District, Qingdao, is a tram system operating in Chengyang District, Qingdao, China. It opened in 2016. The Qingdao Public Transport Group Rail Bus Co., Ltd. is responsible for operation and management. The system is only composed of 1 bus line.\n\n\n== Military ==\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThere are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898\u20131914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R.

Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u8bdd; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo hu\u00e0) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province.

        "wiki": "Qingdao ([t\u0255\u02b0\u00ed\u014bt\u00e0u]; also spelled Tsingtao; Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b) is a major sub-provincial city in eastern Shandong province, China. Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao.

National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year.

The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R.

          "We walked there during the early evening, Just lots of small restaurants.Sea food and beer is not cheap, but price jst ok. beer black and regular only.",
          "Beer street is a hub of restaurant activity for travellers. A great way to spend the afternoon is a tour through the brewery and the finish the evening with a good seafood dinner. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from with staff spruiking their own restaurant. Musicians",
          "A stretch of restaurants just outside the iconic brewery. If the quality had been there you really wouldn't mind paying the inflated prices, but the truth is if it is fresh seafood you are after in a city famous for the stuff avoid eating here.",
          "Food quality is not as good even though the prices are similar to Minjiang and Yunxiao Road. The fish dumplings, which should be white when served at a decent restaurant, are obviously having pork fillings (you can tell by the pink colour), but are charged at the same price.",
          "Not a place for local. Consider really expensive to spent 400rmb on street food which I felt should cost only 200rmb. You can get better and cheaper food in Yun Xiao Road which is also a good whole stretch of local food and beer.",
          "Beer Street it's ok, just lots of restaurants. You should go there from 7pm until around 11pm. After that, the street is dead. The food and beer is not cheap, but ok price. I was hoping to find very good and delicious seafood and I got disappointed, normal food, nothing",
          "I went there during winter, and it was closed. I waited for quite some time from afternoon to night, and there was still nothing. The restaurant were all closed. Maybe it will get better in summer.",
          "It's not a deep cultural experience or anything...try a few Qingdao beers on tap, there's one that has caramel/ roasted barley undertones. As for seafood, must try the grilled fish, crispy skin with tender white meat inside, and meat skewers, that all have more very Xinjiang",
          "Beer street is o.k. for a very green tourist who is making there first adventure into the outside world. It makes you feel like you are living it up Chinese style, but it is a tourist trap like you would not believe. The prices are high, the quality is low. As a result of the",
          "Since the visit was during Winter time, the street was very quiet. Some of the restaurants even closed or under renovation for the preparation of the peak season in Summer. The Beer Museum closes quite early (at 16:30) so make sure that you go before the closing. However, it",
          "Beer everywhere during summer months. Entire street lined with kegs, every establishment drinking. Very lively over the summer",
          "Had a great time in the Beer Street. Lots of fun, food and of course....beer!!!! This is a gathering place for people who just want plain simple night out. Lots of entertainment from street performers who go from bars to bars, table to table soliciting songs or music to play",
          "This is just another drinking and eating street. We walked there during the early afternoon therefore the drinking had not yet started. Along the street are many Chinese Restaurants. Since the Brewery on that street as well we went to check out if it is worthwhile to look at it.",
          "This was a lot of fun to explore. Not very big but you can sit outside and enjoy some brews. Pitchers can be cheap but they can also be expensive. The streets are fun to walk along and can easily enjoy the environment alone.",
          "Great place when you are on tour with your other beer drinking friends! Thanks Morten for showing this to us. It is close to Tsingtao brewery, and there is a beer museum near by, though we didn't make it.",
          "There's tonnes of beer here waiting to be drunk, but I can't give this place a good review. It's basically a stretch with loads of restaurants with beer on tap just outside the Beer Museum. Although a jug of normal beer costs 10RMB, this isn't an option given- we were asked if",
          "Great food & beer, worth a look, but is mostly Chinese food...",
          "We had great fun in Beer St. Very long street filled with local restaurants, and kegs of fresh beer. You can try all different kinds of Tsingdao beer and also eat local foods while trying. We enjoyed the clams, peanuts in brine and edamame beans with our fresh beer. Fresh",
          "Went to annual beer festival on beer street. Small charge to get in and was fairly crowded. Was a fun time, but not that special. Mostly Chinese pop singers in beer halls. Was clean, but most places hot as no air conditioning. \u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u5386\u53f2\u8f83\u60a0\u4e45\u7684\u5564\u9152\u8282\u3002 \u4f46\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3b\u529e\u65b9\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u6392\u573a\u5730\uff0c\u641e\u597d\u7eff\u5316\uff0c \u79cd\u690d\u6811\u6728\uff0c",

        "wiki": "Qingdao ([t\u0255\u02b0\u00ed\u014bt\u00e0u]; also spelled Tsingtao; Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b) is a major sub-provincial city in eastern Shandong province, China. Located on the western shore of Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province. It had jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities till 2019, and As of 2014 had a population of 9,046,200 with an urban population of 6,188,100. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea to its south, it borders the prefectural cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.\nQingdao is a major seaport, naval base and industrial centre.  The world's longest sea bridge, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China.In 2018, Qingdao ranked 31st in the Global Financial Centres Index published by the Z/Yen Group and China Development Institute, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Dalian. In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China's top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at the 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2009, Qingdao was named China's most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, Qingdao was rated as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nJi\u0101o'\u00e0o: (\u80f6\u6fb3): former name during the Qing dynasty.\nQindao: (\u7434\u5c9b, lit. \"Stringed Instrument Isle\"): additional modern name for the area, refers according to locals to the shape of the coastline.\nDaocheng: (\u5c9b\u57ce) Island City\nTsingtao: Postal romanisation\nTsingtau: German name during their concession period (1898\u20131914), written in German romanisation of Chinese (Lessing-Othmer).\nJiaozhou: a historical name which refers to the Jiaozhou Bay.\nKiaochow, Kiauchau, Kiautschou: romanisations of Jiaozhou.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nHuman settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 B.C. \u2013 256 B.C.), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (\u80f6\u6fb3) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese occupations ===\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of 552 square kilometres (136,000 acres; 213 sq mi), it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914\u20131918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\n\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939\u20131945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\n\n=== Qingdao city planning and development ===\n\n\n==== 1898\u20131914 ====\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1898\u20131914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\n\n==== 1914\u20131922 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n\n==== 1922\u20131938 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n\n==== 1938\u20131945 ====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. USS Rentz, USS Reeves, and USS Oldendorf and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (\u533a; q\u016b) and 3 county-level cities (\u5e02; sh\u00ec):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nDefunct - Jiaonan city (Chinese: \u80f6\u5357\u5e02; pinyin: Ji\u0101on\u00e1n Sh\u00ec) - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (German: Schantung Halbinsel). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies 10,654 square kilometres (4,114 sq mi), and stretches in latitude from 35\u00b0 35' to 37\u00b0 09' N and in longitude from 119\u00b0 30' to 121\u00b0 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is 1,133 metres (3,717 ft) above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a 730.64 kilometres (454.00 mi) coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than 50 kilometres (31 mi) can be found in the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 \u00b0C (77.7 \u00b0F). Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only 6.3 \u00b0C (11.3 \u00b0F). Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.96 \u00b0C (55.3 \u00b0F). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221215.5 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958 to 38.9 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 15 July 2002.During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised \u00a552,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness. Until 2018, Qingdao's GDP reaches RMB 1200.15 billion, but a little bit negatively increased in 2019.Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there.\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated 50,000 acres (200 km2) of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\n=== Industrial zones ===\nQingdao Special Economic and Technological Development Area\nQingdao Free Trade Zone\nQingdao High-tech Industrial Zone\nQingdao University Industrial Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThere are a total of 1,145 km (711 mi) of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly 500 km (310 mi) of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nG15 Shenhai Expressway (Shenyang, Liaoning-Haikou, Hainan)\nG18 Rongwu Expressway (Rongcheng, Shandong-Wuhai, Inner Mongolia)\nG20 Qingyin Expressway (Qingdao-Yinchuan, Ningxia)Spur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nG22 Qinglan Expressway (Qingdao-Lanzhou, Gansu)These provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nS16 Rongwei Expressway (Rongcheng-Weifang)\nS19 Longqing Expressway (Longkou-Qingdao)\nS21 Xinwei Expressway (Xinhe-Weifang)\nS24 Weiqing Expressway (Weihai-Qingdao)Other than Expressways, there are also National Highways that pass through or begin in Qingdao. National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\nG204 (Yantai-Shanghai)\nG206 (Yantai-Shantou)\nG308 (Qingdao-Shijiazhuang)\nG309 (Rongcheng-Lanzhou)On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 miles (42.5 km) long and connects Qingdao to Huangdao and Hongdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (4.8 km) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened. The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\n=== Marine ===\nAlso see Port of Qingdao\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached 3.41 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world\u2019s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).The Orient Ferry connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The New Golden Bridge II operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the Blue Sea Ferry operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.Qingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, 23 km (14 mi) away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\n\n=== Intercity rail ===\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, Qingdaobei Railways Station, etc.\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of 300 km/h (190 mph) on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin. T The fastest train between Qingdao and Beijing is G206 / G205 times, 2 hours and 58 minutes neededDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses as of 2012.There are also 136 trolleybuses as of 2012. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (\u9752\u5c9b\u5361), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. After that, all public transportation companies use Qingdaotong Card, the last company started to use this card is Zhenqing bus company located in The West Coast New Area of Qingdao (original Huangdao Distinct) in 2019.\nNon air-conditioned buses cost 1 yuan (excluding the tunnel bus), The volume of road passenger transport approaches 737 million per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus (\u65e5\u65b0\u5df4\u58eb)' is also known in China.\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of 54.7 km (34.0 mi) of subway line 3 was completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for 231.5 km (143.8 mi) in future. As of end of May 2018, the system has an operating length of 170 km (110 mi), lines in operation including Line 2, Line 3, Line 11, and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\n\nQingdao Tram, her official name is: Modern tram demonstration line of Chengyang District, Qingdao, is a tram system operating in Chengyang District, Qingdao, China. It opened in 2016. The Qingdao Public Transport Group Rail Bus Co., Ltd. is responsible for operation and management. The system is only composed of 1 bus line.\n\n\n== Military ==\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThere are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898\u20131914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\nJames R. Lilley, U.S. diplomat\nMa Jian (\u9a6c\u5efa)\nXiao Hong (\u8427\u7ea2)\nXiao Jun (\u8427\u519b)\nDuanmu Hongliang (\u7aef\u6728\u857b\u826f)\nErin Pizzey, (was born in Qingdao)\nLi Zhaoxing (\u674e\u8087\u661f)\nZhang Ruimin (\u5f20\u745e\u654f)\nVictoria Song (\u5b8b\u831c, f(x))\nHuang Zitao (\u9ec4\u5b50\u97ec, musician, actor)\nHuang Bo (\u9ec4\u6e24)\nZhang Jike (\u5f20\u7ee7\u79d1)\nGao Fenghan (\u9ad8\u51e4\u7ff0)\nToshiro Mifune (was born in Qingdao)\nLi Cunxin (\u674e\u5b58\u4fe1)\nHuang Xiaoming (\u9ec4\u6653\u660e)\nChen Hao (\u9648\u597d)\nXia Yu (\u590f\u96e8)\nFan Bingbing (\u8303\u51b0\u51b0, born in Qingdao)\nBai Baihe (\u767d\u767e\u5408)\nHao Haidong (\u90dd\u6d77\u4e1c)\nWang Dong (\u738b\u680b, Chinese Footballer)\nZhang Juanjuan (\u5f20\u5a1f\u5a1f ,archer)\nMalcolm H.

Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (Chinese: \u9752\u5c9b\u8bdd; pinyin: Q\u012bngd\u01ceo hu\u00e0) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard Mandarin, most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nSeafood is a typical delicacy of the coastal city, divided into two categories: \"Great Seafood\" including sea cucumbers, abalones, shark's fin, prawns, crabs, conch, and some big fish, and \"Little Seafood\" comprising squid, shrimps, octopus, oysters, razor clams, clams, periwinkles, yellow croakers, etc.\nThe distinctive cuisine of the area is Lu Cai, the Shandong regional style.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nNotable festivals include:\n\nQingdao International Horticultural Exposition 2014 is the biggest international fair that has been held in the history of the city.\nQingdao International Beer Festival in August/September, held annually since 1991.\n\n\n== Media ==\nQingdao previously had a large German community and a German garrison, so three German newspapers operated in Qingdao. German papers included Deutsch-Asiatische Warte (traditional Chinese: \u6cf0\u6771\u53e4\u4eca\u9451; simplified Chinese: \u6cf0\u4e1c\u53e4\u4eca\u9274; pinyin: T\u00e0id\u014dng G\u01d4j\u012bn Ji\u00e0n; weekly newspaper published until 1906, included Die Welt des Ostens, Altes und Neues aus Asiens drei Kaiserreichen, a cultural supplement), the Tsingtauer Neueste Nachrichten and the Kiautschou Post (a daily paper published from 1908 to 1912, referring to the Kiautschou (Jiaozhou) Bay concession). German publishing in Qingdao ended after World War I and the beginning of the Japanese administration.A 1912 publication of the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce said that the Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina of Tianjin was read in Qingdao, and that major newspapers from Shanghai were also read in Qingdao.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nQingdao attracts many tourists due to its seaside setting and temperate weather. Parks, beaches, sculptures and unique German and modern architecture line the shore.

        "wiki": "Qingdao Liuting International Airport (IATA: TAO, ICAO: ZSQD) is the main international airport serving the city of Qingdao in Shandong Province, China. It is about 31 km (19 mi) from the city center and serves as a hub for Shandong Airlines, Beijing Capital Airlines and Qingdao Airlines as well as a focus city for China Eastern Airlines. A replacement airport, Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport, is fully complete since mid-2020, but the official opening date has yet to be announced.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 2004 to 2006, the airport underwent an expansion of its terminal as well as adding more parking spaces which was part of its initial 2010 goal to expand Liuting Airport to handle 5.2 million passengers annually or 2400 passengers and almost 120,000 tons of cargo hourly. The runway was also extended to its current length. Its IATA code is used for its former romanized name Tsingtao.In 2018, Qingdao Liuting was the 15th busiest airport in China with 24.53 million passengers. Due to its lack of room to expand as it is being surrounded by the city, in December 2013, the Chinese government approved the construction of Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport which will replace Liuting as Qingdao's main airport by the second half of 2019.Qingdao did not have a non-stop intercontinental air link until 29 March 2016, when Lufthansa's existing service to Frankfurt, Germany via Shenyang was upgraded to a non-stop flight to Frankfurt. Later in the year, Beijing Capital Airlines introduced service to Melbourne, Australia and Vancouver, Canada in early 2017.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe airport is about 31 kilometres (19 mi) north of the city, and connected by taxis, three airport shuttle bus lines (701\u8def, 702\u8def, 703\u8def), two tourism bus lines (Huangdao Special Line, Jiaonan Special Line), and intercity buses to neighboring cities. When open, Line 7 of the Qingdao Metro will connect with the airport, operating trains between Qingdao International Sailing Centre and Bei'an Street, Jimo City.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of airports in China\nChina's busiest airports by passenger traffic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Qingdao Liuting International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nAirport information for ZSQD at World Aero Data.

        "wiki": "Penglai, formerly known as Dengzhou or Tengchow, is a district belonging to the prefecture-level city of Yantai, Shandong Province, in the People's Republic of China. It lies on the northwest corner of the Shandong Peninsula on the southern coast of the Gulf of Bohai. The city is famous for its mirages out at sea, which are frequent during May and June.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPenglai is entirely surrounded by other divisions of Yantai: Fushan District is to the east, Longkou City to the west, and Qixia City to the south. Its limits in geographic coordinates are 37\u00b0 25'\u201337\u00b0 50' N, 120\u00b0 35'\u2013121\u00b0 09' E.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Red Cliffs (\u4e39\u5d16) of the area are reputed to have been the site where the Eight Immortals set out for the land of the immortals and where Qin Shi Huang later sent off five hundred boys and five hundred girls on ships to search for them. Chinese legends held that a mystic dolphin was seen from the cliffs above and, missing it with his spear, the emperor knew that his days were numbered. The Martial Emperor of Han (Han Wudi) later also visited the area while searching for the elixir of immortality.\nThe old city walls incorporate guard towers of three stories (rather than the usual two) because the uncle of the first emperor of the 6th-century Sui dynasty had been prince of the area. Under the Ming, the harbor was fortified and used by the war junks of the imperial navy.\nDuring the early years of the Manchu invasion of China, Portuguese artillerists were instructing Ming forces at Dengzhou when it was besieged by a mutinous army under Kong Youde in February 1632. Captain Gon\u00e7alo Teixeiro was killed during its sack, but the 70-year-old Jesuit linguist Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues escaped by jumping from the city walls into the sea. Kong's forces then seized the Portuguese cannon and used them to pillage the countryside before joining the Manchu invaders who eventually established China's Qing Dynasty.\nFollowing the Second Opium War, Dengzhou became the first port opened to foreigners on the Shandong Peninsula in 1858. Christian missions were quickly established. The harbor was found inadequate for the traders, however, and Zhifu (now central Yantai) was developed 30 miles (48 km) away to function as Dengzhou's port.Penglai is mentioned in the fictional stories about Judge Dee by Robert van Gulik, first mentioned in the book The Chinese Gold Murders.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nThe city contains seven townships (\u9547), five subdistricts (\u8857\u9053), and three development zones (\u533a):\n\nBeigou Town (\u5317\u6c9f\u9547): contains Xicheng Port Industrial Park (\u897f\u57ce\u4e34\u6e2f\u5de5\u4e1a\u533a)\nChaoshui Town (\u6f6e\u6c34\u9547)\nCunli Town (\u6751\u91cc\u96c6\u9547)\nDaliu Town (\u5927\u67f3\u884c\u9547): contains a namesake industrial park\nDaxindian Town (\u5927\u8f9b\u5e97\u9547)\nDengzhou Subdistrict (\u767b\u5dde\u8857\u9053): where Qin Shi Huang reputedly visited to gain immortality\nLiujiagou Town (\u5218\u5bb6\u6c9f\u9547)\nNanwang Subdistrict (\u5357\u738b\u8857\u9053)\nPenglai Economic Development Zone (\u84ec\u83b1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f00\u53d1\u533a): contains three industrial parks\nPenglai Tourism-Vacation Area (\u84ec\u83b1\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a)\nPenglai Urban District (\u84ec\u83b1\u57ce\u533a)\nPenglaige Subdistrict (\u84ec\u83b1\u9601\u8857\u9053)\nXiaomenjia Town (\u5c0f\u95e8\u5bb6\u9547)\nXingang Subdistrict (\u65b0\u6e2f\u8857\u9053)\nZijing Subdistrict (\u7d2b\u8346\u5c71\u8857\u9053)Together, the three qu (zone, district, and area) co-exist with the coastal Xingang Subdistrict.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n374,400 Penglai citizens work in agriculture, with the remaining 75,600 in various other sectors.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nPenglai has been ranked by the Chinese government as a top domestic tourist destination. Its Water Fortress (\u6c34\u57ce, Shu\u00edch\u00e9ng), a fortified harbor, is one of China's oldest military ports. It was built under the Ming in 1376 and housed a fleet of warjunks. It is now a protected historical monument being renovated at a cost of 500m RMB (more than $60m). There is a plank walk along the cliffs nearby.\nMore than US$25 million has also been invested into developing the Penglai Pavilion and other sites. The Penglai Pavilion is a large park of ancient buildings, palaces and temples, that have been restored and rebuilt. It has been a tourist goal for more than a thousand years, and the site features inscriptions from famous poets and calligraphers like Su Shi and Dong Qichang. Among other cultural attractions of Penglai are the Naval Museum with exhibits of ancient ships and the restored residence of the famous patriotic general Qi Jiguang. Penglai also has the largest ocean aquarium in Asia. It includes a polar area, a shark hall, a tropical rainforest, and a theater with mermaids, dolphins and sea lions. A picturesque festival takes place in January for the birthday of Tianhou, a local sea goddess.\nWhile tourism is the mainstay of Penglai's economy, bringing more than two million tourists annually, in fact the entire center of the town around the harbour was walled off and completely razed in 2006.\n\n\n=== Wine industry ===\nThe production of wine is the second largest industry in the province. Agriculture is first. However, in Penglai, tourism is the primary industry, and wine-making is second. The hills south of Penglai have an average elevation of 200 metres (660 ft), while the coastal areas are relatively flat. Most of the soil is loose, well-aerated, and rich in minerals and organic matters that enable full development of the root systems. The wineries are located mainly in the Nanwang Grape Valley and along the Yan-Peng Sightseeing Highway.  The main varieties grown there, like Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Gernischt, Merlot, Riesling and Chardonnay, are all reaching 20 years of age, considered to be the golden stage for these grapes.  Most of them maintain an average sugar content of above 20%.  The Cabernet is especially typical, with good color and a dense fragrance.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nQi Jiguang (\u621a\u7ee7\u5149, 1528\uff0d1588) Ming Dynasty general and national hero who fought Japanese pirates\nHenry Luce (1898\u20131967) - born in Penglai, founder of TIME, Fortune, and Life.\nIda Pruitt (1888\u20131985) - born in Penglai, spoke fluent Chinese, prolific writer on China\nWu Peifu (\u5434\u4f69\u5b5a, 1874\u20131939) - army general, later became one of the most powerful military rulers in China during the Warlord Era (1916\u20131928)\nMeng Xuenong (simplified Chinese: \u5b5f\u5b66\u519c; traditional Chinese: \u5b5f\u5b78\u8fb2; pinyin: M\u00e8ng Xu\u00e9n\u00f3ng 1949- ) - vice-governor and acting governor of Shanxi (as of 2007) and disgraced former Mayor of Beijing Municipality\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther Penglais\nOther Dengzhous\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n Baynes, T.

        "wiki": "Fort Lovrijenac or St. Lawrence Fortress, often called \"Dubrovnik's Gibraltar\", is a fortress and theater outside the western wall of the city of Dubrovnik in Croatia, 37 metres (121 ft) above sea level. Famous for its plays and importance in resisting Venetian rule, it overshadows the two entrances to the city, from the sea and by land. Early in the 11th century the Venetians attempted to build a fort on the same spot where Fort Lovrijenac currently stands. If they had succeeded, they would have kept Dubrovnik under their power, but the people of the city beat them to it. The \"Chronicles of Ragusa\" reveal how the fort was built within just three months time and from then on constantly reconstructed. When the Venetian ships arrived, full of materials for the construction of the fort, they were told to return to Venice. The Croatian leg of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series takes place in Lovrijenac.\n\n\n== Layout of the fort ==\nLovrijenac has a triangular shape with three terraces. The thickness of the walls facing the outside reach 12 metres (39 ft) whereas the section of the walls facing the inside, the actual city, are only 60 centimetres (24 in) thick. Two drawbridges lead to the fort and above the gate there is an inscription Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro (Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world). Lovrijenac's use as a stage was a recent addition to the history of the fort, and the performance of Shakespeare's Hamlet has become the symbol of Dubrovnik Summer Festival.\nA production of Midsummer Nights Dream was performed here as part of Midsummer Scene in the summer of 2017.  The TV series Knightfall, an historical fiction drama about the Knights Templar started filming during the last week of June 2017 around the fort and the bay of Pile, these scenes were meant to depict the Siege of Acre (1291).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWalls of Dubrovnik\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fort Lovrijenac at Wikimedia Commons\n\nDubrovnik City Walls\nDubrovnik forts and gates",

          "One of the first 'eyeful' views before heading into the walled city at Pile Gate. Game Of Thrones site. A guide will show you many features but there is a steep climb & then stairs - but it is worth it! If coach loads of site seers are emptying out at Pile Gate, walking up to",
          "Your city walls ticket includes a free visit of the fort. After climbing all the stairs you'll be rewarded with a great view over the old city.",
          "This is just opposite to the Dubrovnik walls and beautiful views could be seen from one of another. Game of throne episode locations are here. Steep climb to reach the top but not too many steps to worry about. There are some canons and canon balls to view. Other than",
          "Great views when you finally get up to the entrance . Lots of stairs. The wall ticket will give you access to the Fort and it is a must just for the views. There is a toilet inside the fort.",
          "Super cool. You realy have to visit and take a tour! Our quide was awesome and showed us all to cool spots and knew the history very well.",
          "There were free washrooms in the fort! It does not take long to walk around the fort approximately 30 minutes. Ther is great scenery from the two balconies for pictures, etc and some scenes from games of thrones were filmed here. There is quite a few stairs up to the castle so",
          "Great piece of Game of Thrones scenery but also great views and history. Try to get there early to avoid crowds.",
          "If you want to get the best view of the Walls of Dubrovnik, then this is the place. Just a bit of a climb up (no big deal really as you can stop, rest, and enjoy the view as you go up). I'm glad I did, I almost didn't as I was already tired of the climb all around the walls.",
          "This fort is a really nice place to go. Game of Thrones was filmed here in part so it has a really good feel to it. Views of the city and water are wonderful. You can picnic up there too.",
          "From below, climbing up Fort Lovrijenac is quite intimidating. But the views are worth it! We climbed with our 4yo daughter and it was amazing.",
          "If you\u2019ve already hiked around the Old City walls, this is another easier hike but with superior views. It was also much less crowded than other sites. Impressive fortress.",
          "Ten years ago, this ancient fort with the unpronouncable name (to native English-speakers, anyway) probably enjoyed a few visitors each day. The climb up to the top of the cliff is steep, and there is not a lot to see when you get there...a few empty, stone-walled rooms, a lot",
          "While doing the old city walls walk, you will pass this fort. A great place for views of the sea, wall and town and another nice memory from GOT.",
          "This impressive Fort also called St.Lawrence Fort, is located outside the western walls and there is separate entrance ticket other than ticket to Walls. Famous for resisting the Venetian rule, this triangular shaped historical Fort with three terraces narrate many inspiring",
          "Takes about 30 minutes to see the whole place. Very nice view from the top. Could be better, there was nothing to inform us about history and whereabouts.",
          "One of the best turistic sites on Dubronivnik. Nice place and nice views of the Old Town. Also to take a GOT Tour.",
          "Great city and actually was not that crowded, I would recommend going after 10/1. That seems to be the start of off season and for a small walled city, it was not as crowded as Split or Kotor - Kotor is empty once the cruise ships leave or everyone boards for the night!!",
          "Entry to the fort is included in the ticket for the walls. It is a short but steep walk up the hill. It doesn\u2019t take long to see everything we got there at 3.40 and it was closing at 4pm and we managed to get around all of it. If you are thinking of doing the walls look into the",
          "Fitbit watches encourage you by the number of steps you take in a day. They give you further encouragement if you walk up steps instead of taking the lift. The Fort doesn\u2019t have a lift. There are plenty of steps. You get a nice view of the Old City from the top.",
          "If you get a ticket for the city walls then you can get in here for free. It\u2019s got great views but like others have said there is no information anywhere. A must if you are a game of thrones fan though.",
          "Disclaimer: I like castles and massive medieval structures. For Lovrijenac is a massive stone fortress sitting on a mountainous rock; it looks imposing and is in remarkable shape. Unless you purchased the 1-day or 3-day city pass, the admission is about $8 (and, IMHO, worth",
          "Not cheap to get in and not information once you enter about the history of the fort. It was used for various GOT scenes. The view from the top is great.",
          "A bit of a trek, but well worth climbing the steps as the views are beautiful. If you have walked the city walls before heading to the fort, the price of entry for the fort is included in that ticket - we didn\u2019t know this and ended up paying 50kn for entry as we planned to",
          "For 30 Kuna, or part of a Dubrovnik Card, this is well worth a visit and climbing the stairs to gain beautiful views. If you love Dubrovnik, like me, you can't have too many photos of the walled city and the areas surrounding it.",
          "We arrived with only 15 minutes until closing. The man in the gate asked about what else we had paid to do in Dubrovnik and then let us in free to take a few photos. Rare to get full consideration these days. We were very appreciative. The fort is well maintained and has some",
          "This is an historic monument - be prepared for lots of steps! A lot of visitors now will of course visit for GoT - as did I. But, a lot of older natives feel that GoT and to a lesser extent Star Wars have overtaken this historical city. The views are fantastic and its history",
          "If you\u2019re also visiting the city walls, your ticket includes Fort Lovrijenac. There\u2019s not a huge amount inside but it is fun wandering the various galleries and looking out over the city and sea",
          "This 14th century fort is situated just outside the western side of the old town and is accessible via a steep set of steps. We got entry using our Dubrovnik card. Inside I was amazed at the superb state of preservation of the walls, some are 12 meters thick, and the general",
          "Included in ticket for fort tour and gave a really good view of the city fort. Steps up a little taxing but so worth it.",
          "We visited the fort as part of a tour and returned later in the day for another visit. The steps are steep so take care when crowds are busy. The fort is small but provides amazing views of the old town. A must for any Game of Thrones fan.",
          "One of the highlights of our trip. The fort itself is super cool but the views from the top are simply spectacular! When you buy the ticket to walk the walls, you can use the same pass to access the fort. We went a couple of days after which was nice.",
          "If you like lots of signs and tons of explanations then FYI there are none here so I would suggest booking a tour that includes the fort or you bring your guide book with you. The fort has utterly fantastic views of Dubrovnik including the old city so if you would like a shot of",
          "Our tour guide took us here as part of the Game of Thrones tour. The fortress isn't big, climbing up the steep steps might be a leg stretch but the views are worth it. You can get the best picture of the walls of Dubrovnik from the fortress. I would still recommend this place",
          "Your ticket to the walls gets you into the fort as well. Definitely worth for the views of the city and out over the water. The fort was used for the Red Keep, so lots of GOT tours all around.",
          "The views back of the town are wonderful. Don\u2019t forget that admission (usually HRK 50 each) is free with your ticket to the twin walls.",
          "Fort lovrijenac was well worth the time and effort. It\u2019s a massive fort just outside of the old town although beware it\u2019s quite a walk to get to( many many steps) beautiful views of the old town up there and the fort it\u2019s self is very impressive. Not much information about so",
          "We loved our trip to the fort. There were very few people, the views were amazing, and the fort looked like it hadn\u2019t changed in hundreds of years",
          "The walk upto the fort is worth the effort the views of the old town are spectacular! Not to mention that Game of Thrones was filmed there inside the fort isn\u2019t that big but the views make up for it well worth a visit when Dubrovnik the price is included in the wall ticket.",
          "Many scenes from Game of Thrones filmed here. Easy trek up the hill with great views out to the water and city walls.",
          "It is a lovely fort and you have free entry if you visited the wall. Hete dome scenes of Game of Thrones was filmed and a lot of tourists come here.",
          "Entrance here is included in your ticket if you have walked the city walls. It's a little bit of a trek to get here from the main city, so be aware of that if you have mobility issues, but it's well worth it. You pass stunning scenery on the way (and stuff you'll recognise if",
          "Early in the 11th century, the people of Dubrovnik learned of a plan devised by the Venetians to build a fort on the very rock Lovrijenac Fort now stands. By doing so, they would conquer the city. In just three months, the people of Dubrovnik built a fortress of their own. When",
          "It was great to see the locations where Game of Thrones was shot. I recommend to have the guided tour, as they show you images of the movie in each of the locations you visit. Maybe if you do it by yourself you will miss lot of them because some of them are not that obvious.",
          "The entrance to the fort is situated just off the side of the square by the bus station outside the pile gate. It\u2019s a stiff and at times steep, but rewarding climb up to the fort. Entrance is included with your ticket to walk the old city walls. There\u2019s a small courtyard then",
          "Well worth visiting, there isn't much inside the fort apart for a couple of cannons that probably aren't from the fort and over sized cannon balls. Skip that the view is amazing and for Game of Thrones fans walk in the foot steps of celbs. Short visit but it is worth it jist",
          "Well worth a visit - if you walk the walls entry to the Fort is free (within 3 days) otherwise it is 50 kuna. Path to it isn't obvious - but from Pile gate stay to right of the fountain and head down the stairs and you'll get there. Lovely little beach areas on both sides -",
          "We visited here at 8am and it was lovely and peaceful with amazing views of Old Town. I'd imagine this gets much busier later on in the day.",
          "Fort Lovrijenac is amazing..day or night..spectacular city and ocean views..cost is included in City walls tour..the fort itself is pretty impressive..and is a must if your a game of thrones fan..",
          "Well worth the climb to the top where the views were stunning. This was also one of the film locations on GOT, and this will become evident when inside. There are very clean wash rooms inside the fort, which one may be very grateful for having made the climb.",
          "Well worth a visit and best time is in the evening when the sun is behind you looking over the Old Town. Entry is 50 HRK or free with a City Walls ticket. Nothing inside but several levels to the fortifications. Quite a lot of steps to climb to get there.",
          "Went to the Fort as the entry is included in your ticket to walk the walls. Views from the walls are better, not sure Id bother if it wasn't included unless you are a real Game of Thrones fan!",
          "We enjoyed the fort and the story of its history with the old city. As Game of Thrones fans, we really loved walking around the Red Keep!! It takes some stair climbing, but well worth it!",
          "St. Lawrence's Fortress sits on a 40 foot rock and helped to preserve Dubrovnik's freedom. First records show that it was in place as early a 1301 but was actually built earlier. It defended Dubrovnik from the sea and defended Dubrovnik's Pile gate. The entrance to this fort",
          "Kids needed to take breaks but climbed to the top. Views were breathtaking. Good to see city walls as could see fort from the walls.",
          "Entrance 50 kuna and a snip at the price compared to the old walls entry( it is discounted off walls entry fee if you also do the walls) the fabled red keep from kings landing in GOT. Gr8 entry via high narrow door top of staircase and from atop gr8 views of city and coast. Has",
          "A beautiful fortress offering stunning views of the old town, and located just in front of the walls of Dubrovnik. The steps up to to the fortress are pretty challenging but it's good exercise! Use the ticket bought for the city walls in order have free admission.",
          "Free entry with City Walls ticket - valid for 3 days after purchase. Steep climb to the entrance but worth it! A short walk from Pile Gate. Whether you are a GoT fan or not a visit to Fort Lovrijenac is worth the trip to explore the Fort and witness the stunning views from the",
          "Quite a climb up the steep stairs to the main entrance. Well worth it though. We visited this Fort as part of the Game of Thrones walking tour. It was so fun and amazing to visit this site and the tour guide pointed to us and showed us scenes from GOT that were filmed there.",
          "The ticket to Fort Lovrijenac (aka Fort Lawrence, though our cab driver recognized only the Croatian name) is included with the Dubrovnik Walls ticket. Even if you think you\u2019ve seen enough beautiful views after doing the Dubrovnik Walls, this is a must because the views are of,",
          "Beautiful building with stunning views, seems to attract Game of thrones fans but having never watched it no idea why. It\u2019s worth the walk up for the views.",
          "The fort is beautiful and gives a good view on the city and port. Try to find the places where they shot some scenes in Game of Thrones. And hwhn you have visited the Dubrovnik walls visiting this fort is for free.",
          "Worth the climb up to the top of the fort for the spectacular views out to sea and of the old town - stop at the harbour below for drinks and people watching - particularly the Game of Throne tours!",
          "The fort is a must for the Game of Thrones fans. There are tours showing specific locations of scenes shot. There's plenty of movie equipment and props laying around for you to envision where the stars would be. Well even if your not a Game of Thrones fan, it offers spectacular",
          "Fort Lovrigenac is a defensive fort overlooking Dubrovniks old port outside of the old city walls. If you are walking the old city walls there are great views of both the fort and the old port it was built to defend from Fort Bokar. Note that if you have time to visit, the old",
          "Fort Lovrijenac is located across from Fort Bokar and is accessible from the parking area outside of Od Town",
          "We got in for free with the Dubrovnik card and had a great afternoon exploring. It's not that big but we spent a good hour here so definitely one to put on the list if you're visiting the Old Town.",
          "We toured the city walls and the pass included the ticket to enter the fort which was a plus. It was very interesting to see the fort. We learned during a walking tour this was used to house prisoners at one point too. Good view of the old town.",
          "If you do the city walls; this is included in the fare. It\u2019s a must! It has a breathtaking view over old town and the walls. You wouldn\u2019t spend much time there but it\u2019s a nice break from the big crowds. There are. Few stairs to go up, but easily manageable! Perfect spot to get",
          "Entry to the city walls provides free entrance to this and other attractions. An interesting and practical design worth the steep walk up the steps. Read up before visiting since there is little information inside. Free toilets.",
          "Came here at the end of our Game of Thrones walking tour through Dubrovnik & very glad we did. We didn\u2019t pay for the city walls walk, so had to pay 50 kuna each to get in, but well worth it. The views from the top were amazing & our tour guide explaining all of the Game of",
          "You do have to walk up 200 steps to get there but its worth it for the wonderful views. This was used as the Red Keep in GOT for any fans.",
          "WOW!!! This is Mecca for GOT Fans but beautiful in its own right also. Magnificent views. a lot of the staging equipment for filming is still in situ.",
          "Very fine views and lots of game of thrones scenes well explained on a tour. If you are a fan a must, not much inside but worth it just for the views. Well maintained and overall worth an hour, its included in the price of the walls of Dubrovnik.",
          "This is the fort on the right of the two just outside the Pile gate. It is a separate entrance. It is part of the Dubrovnik card package too. It is quite picturesque from the plaza below and especially at or near sunset when the fort is lit up. To go in you pay or use the",
          "It's a bit of a hike up, but 100% worth it. I just loved this place along with Old Town and the walls. If you visit Dubrovnik, this is definitely one of your must visit places!",
          "We unfortunately didn't have time to visit the fortress inside, but the views from the staircase and from the main gate were enough to convince me that there's no need to buy ticket for the Walls in old city. Because you simply see much more of the old city than if you climb the",
          "This is basically the Red Keep from Game of Thrones. It's a nice location but a bit underwhelming compared to the rest of Dubrovnik. It is however included in the ticket for the city walls so it doesn't hurt to visit. They're also nowadays performing a Romeo and Juliet play",
          "Cost is 50kuna without a ticket for the walls (kuna only no euro). Worth the stairs (and there are a lot of them!). Beautiful old fortress that hosts stunning views of the bay (GoT anyone? :) I probably wouldn\u2019t pay just to see this however with the walls it is worth it. We",
          "I was so surprised to find almost no visitor interested in the inscription \u201cNon Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro\u201d (Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world) from this fort, all visitors passing by did not notice the existence of such inscription. For",

          "Seeing you paid an exorbitant amount to \"walk the Muralles\", or worse, paid for a Dubrovnik Card, you should visit Fort Lovrijenac, because it is included in the package. It is a bit of a steep climb up, just outside the main gate, and it lacks proper signage, but really, you",
          "Steep steps but view breathtaking and lovely to ok over at the walked town..... Because of the plays held there it was like being on a film set which took away from it's authenticity...there were wires strewn around...random chairs....speakers and taped wire to floor.for me took",
          "Great experience to climb up the stone steps from \"Black Water Bay\" to another magnificent landmark just outside the city walls, great views in all directions.",
          "It is not that bad climb of stairs as it loks from the bottom in the end! The view on old town is great. GoT tours come there too, so you can listen to those guides if they are there same time.",
          "amazing fort to see and take photos and lovey views and game of thrones was filmed there amazing place",
          "The entrance was 50 kuna. The fort offers a superb view of the old town. Also, each night you can go and watch a theater play (in English) - now it's Romeo and Juliet. Many Game of Thrones scens were filmed here. Also, in ww2 it served as war prison.",
          "This is part of the G.O.T tour, but we did it on our own. You are at the highest point so get the best views and its a lot cheaper than paying for the whole tour. Lots of steps though so wear good shoes.",
          "We visited the fort as it was included in the Dubrovnik pass, hence walk walk ticket. It's quite a climb up and the views back to the city are great. Not a great deal to see otherwise, however, it was worth a visit.",
          "The entrance to Fort Lovrijenac is included with the ticket price for the Walls. It's worth climbing up to it as the views are really good.",
          "To be honest, I visited the fort because entrance was included with the ticket for the Old City walls; but it was worth it. It is a LITTLE bit of a climb up to the entrance, but you do need to earn your dinner, so crack on. The fort itself has same interesting features,",
          "250 steps up to the fort, but worth it on the whole for the views. Nice gardens surround it & there are two restaurants at the base. Free with Dubrovnik Card.",
          "Viewed the fort as part of a Game of Thrones tour. But it also sat on the hill above our hotel. It was a beautiful sight both in the day, and lit up at night. Definitely woth a visit if you have any interest in history.",
          "Your City Walls ticket includes this fort, so take advantage! It is a spectacular view up on the cliff with a very steep climb. Once inside it is pretty much standard stone fort. Nothing too spectacular about it honestly. There were tons of GOT tours going on and people",
          "It's the red keep (game of thrones) and therefore amazing to see in real life. It's my favourite view in the old town. Worth coming to dubrovnik just for that!",
          "This is easy to climb and get a perfect photo shoot at the entrance of the door where in Games of Thrones . Above the door leading to the fortress there is a famous inscription carved in stone: \u201cNon Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro\u201d (\u201cFreedom cannot be sold for all the gold",
          "We did the Fort as part of the Dubrovnik Walking Tours Game of Thrones tour, thank goodness we chose to do the morning \u2013 the steps are hard work but the views are well worth it. Wear comfortable shoes! If you have a Dubrovnik card do the fort first then it is free then you can",
          "There are great views from the castle but beware the steep steps leading up to it can be hard going on a warm day. There isn't much to see in the castle but the views make up for it.",
          "Hi early in the morning for some great views of the Old City. Make sure you take your ticket from doing the Walls and you will get in for free...otherwise probably it worth it unless you are a GOT fan",
          "We visited as part of a got tour and were shown all the filming locations. You can get free entry to this if you pay for the city walls.",
          "We visited the Fort and the City Walls on different days. We bought a Dubrovnik Pass for 270 Kn each which included entry to walls and fort which would have been 200 Kn each.If you keep the ticket stubs you can get in both days. The Pass also includes a number of local bus rides",
          "Visited the fort in the late morning. It\u2019s made on different levels and the view from each level is more breathtaking than the previous. A must see",
          "We visited the walls earlier this day (200hrk) and the wall ticket includes entry to the Fort. Additionally, if you pay the 50hrk entry to the Fort, you can use the ticket to only pay the remaining 150hrk at the city walls. It\u2019s a beautiful destination that we visited as a part",
          "The entry fee is free with Dubrovnik Card. On the top, there is open area that has great view of ocean and old town. On the way to Fort, there is a GOT filming location, view is amazing. Right outside Fort, view is great as well!",
          "I used my free entrance with my Walls ticket (but all covered by Dubrovnik Card and you have 3 days to go post Walls anyway). Did it on same day and really enjoyed the views back to the walls of the old town. Lovely.",
          "The entry fee is included in the purchase of the Dubrovnik City Walls, so if you are willing to climb some more stairs after your walk around the walls then you're in luck! There isn't a lot to see inside the fort but there is a great open area that has great views of the ocean",
          "Visited as part of a GOT walking tour. Get the wall walking ticket first to get in here for free. Or take this ticket and get 50 kunas off the wall tour. Either way good value to do both I think. International student cards work for the wall but not the fort strangely. Lovely",
          "We had purchased a one day Dubrovnik card which included access to the wall and the fort. As a GoT fans we were finding as many locations from the show on our own. There\u2019s a couple here. If not a GoT fan, the views are worth the walk up the stairs... stunning!",
          "We visited this place after we walked the walls, as the entry to the fort was included in the city walls ticket. Its a great place go look around (especially if your a game of throne lover) also it gave a spectacular view of debrovik city walls.",
          "A must visit part of Dubrovnik especially for GOT fans. High up on the cliff next to the old town this fort is full of history and amazing views. Could easily spend a couple of hours strolling around the fort and watching the world go by.",
          "On the outside of the city walls of Dubrovnik, and at walking distance from the \u201cAmerling Fountain\u201d, you have the \u201cFort Lovrijenac\u201d or the \u201cSt. Lawrence Fortress\u201d, people often called it the \"Dubrovnik's Gibraltar\", it is a fortress and theater outside the western wall of the",
          "Well worth the visit (I went 4 times) - taking a tour guide helps the first time but the views back across Dubrovnik old town are excellent.",
          "We visited here on our second visit to the old city of Dubrovnik. Again you need to wear comfortable shoes as there are many steps. Good views.",
          "The fort was located in a beautiful setting. The 360 views were incredible, all and all do not miss. The view and seeing the the other.One eg the fort, Dubrovnik city And Adriatic were amazing.",
          "We went here as part of our Game of Thrones Tour. Steep steps up but probably doable for almost everyone. The views are incredible looking over the small swimming harbour and the back over the old town. even if your'e not a game of thrones fan the tower is a worthwhile climb.",
          "Climbed to the top of this tower if you\u2019re a Game Of Thrones fan then this is a must as it\u2019s the red keep in the film.",
          "If you visit the wall (who wouldn\u2019t?), it includes going here, so save your ticket and go! Lots of stairs, but with a really beautiful view! Ofc you should go!",
          "Many stone steps to be climbed before you get to the entrance and many more inside. The views from the top were worth the effort",
          "Just like many other places to visit in Dubrovnik, be prepared for another round of stairs, but you can have a rest at the middle of the road, where is small park and a few benches or you just can sit down. The views from the stairs over the Pile Harbour and the West Pier are",
          "its a hike and not much to the fortress. it is still old and big but the views from above toward the town, old town and the surrounds make the effort worth it.",
          "If you're on one of the many walking tours, you are likely to end up here. A GoT must, there is a little bit of climbing to be done, but the reward is spectacular. Possibly, my favourite place in Dubrovnik. By the way, entry is free is you have a Dubrovnik Card. The views down",
          "We visited the fort as part of a G.O.T. tour so there were some interesting locations and stories for fans of the show as well as the true historical narrative. Lots of steps to climb but worth it for the great views from the top.",
          "Lot of steps to get all the way up. At the fort there is nothing special to see, but the view is awesome.",
          "The structure itself is just a bunker, basically. The view on the old town is really mesmerizing though! Also, if you like GoT it offers some nice foto ops.",
          "I loved it. Not a lot inside other than a few cannons and cannonballs but really stunning views of the old town and the small harbor. Definitely worth a visit if you have the time. Admission is included if you already have a ticket to the city walls.",
          "Entrance to the city walls includes the fortress, which is a short 5-10 min walk from the Pile gate. The fortress itself is impressive, with steep stairs and lots of spots to look around. There isn\u2019t much in the fort itself, but it gives beautiful views of Dubrovnik and the sea.",
          "Make sure you keep your ticket from the Wall Walk because you need that to enter the Fort. It's quite a few steps so be sure you're up for that. Beautiful views at the top.",
          "Really its just a viewing point. Once inside you have great views of the city walls but other than that I wouldn't bother. Inside the Fort its empty and there's zero to no information about the Fort. I went in and after a few snaps I was out within 15mins with no information of",
          "Great place for pictures. You can look back at Dubrovnik and the city walls. Lots of steep stairs. The water around the fort is amazingly clear and turquoise blue.",
          "The views were lovely, but I wouldn't pay for this attraction separately. Admission was included in our wall entrance tickets. There is no information about the history of the fort available at the fort, so come prepared. The walk over to the fortress is pleasant. We got our",
          "With all the history in Dubrovnik the Old Town Walls are a must and the Fort is across the small harbour and definitely worth a visit. You can get a 24 hour Dubrovnik Card from the Tourist Information which is so worth buying as you can get into 9 different attractions for the",
          "You get a great view of the city that's often left out on the postcards (not really sure why...) The walk to the fortress is picturesque and enjoyable in itself",
          "This is a must-see for your first visit to Dubrovnik! It has such a great history, amazing photo ops, and was used many times in the filming of Game of Thrones. When we went, it was 50 kuna per adult to enter. To get the most out of it, I'd recommend having a guide to tell you",
          "The views from the fortress and the walk heading to the fortress are gorgeous. After spending time in the fortress make sure you walk around the grounds and look down at the other cove. Its so beautiful.",
          "This Fort is beautiful and has great views of the city! It is 50 kn and if you go to the city walls first you get access to the fort as well without the additional cost. However, there is not much to see here. You can walk around the fort and the walls but that is all. There",
          "Entrance to Fort Lovrijenic is included in the fee paid to walk around the city walls. Lots of steps to get to the top, but the views make it worthwhile.",
          "Amazing views of Old Town and the sea from this historic Fort standing on its own in the water. You just wanted to stand there and be fully present to all you could see.",
          "Firstly buy the Dubrovnik Card, do the city wall walk and your ticket GETS YOU INTO THE FORT FREE. Also even a 1 day gets you the 10% discount at the restaurants as there is no date to check.",
          "I went to this castle as part of my Game of Thrones tour. There were many recognizable scenes filmed here. The castle itself is really cool as well. Note that you do have to pay extra to get into the castle, but it is well worth it.",
          "As if we didn't already have enough steps at the city walls, we had some more to get up here, and let me tell you the wind was on the roll so it was hard to get up, but so worth it! Also as a GOT fan it would be a shame I didn't visit this place, right? I don't know about solo",
          "The access to the fort is not the easiest, as there are quite a lot of stairs to climb to get to the entrance. On the way to it, make sure to admire the scenery and the lookout you get on the walled city. Probably the best point of views of Dubrovnik can be had just before",
          "Some of the best views in Dubrovnik! A few stairs to climb but it's all worth it at the end. Did a GOTs tour that led us here.",
          "Our City Walls tickets got us free entrance into the fort. Worth the trip for great views and a quick 20 - 30 minute excursion compared to the wall. Again, having done our Game of Thrones research in advance made it more fun to spot the sets.",
          "Used in the filming of G Of Thrones, this well preserved fort with stunning views of the old city of Dubrovnik, is steeped in history and well worth the visit. Mindful of the many steps/stairs, be prepared to take short stops to not only catch your breath, but to enjoy the views",
          "When you see Fort Lovrijenac and Fort Bokar, you realize how well fortified the city of Dubrovnik was. Easy to get pictures of Fort Lovrijenac from the plaza near the Pile Gate.",
          "If you want fantastic pictures of Dubrovnik's Old Town, then you must visit this fort. There are about 200 steps to get to the entrance of the Fort but it is totally worth it. Again, the view is outstanding. All of my pictures look like I have been photoshopped into them. Also,",
          "The fortress is located outside the main walls and accessed via a network of back streets from behind the market/bus stop area. Signage is limited so just follow your nose and head towards it and you will soon find your way. The views of the walled city are superb and this makes",
          "this fort is maybe the most original one, the only fort that is not connecte to walls, the only that stands alone on rock next to old city walls...",
          "Included in the 150 kunar entrance fee to walk the city wall is entrance to this fort. We climbed 177 steps to the first floor then another 26 plus another 44 but the marvellous view from the top made the climb worthwhile. The fort lies outside the City Walls at the Western",
          "The fort itself is not very large, but worth visiting, and gives a superb view of the city walls of Dubrovnik, the old town and the seaward side of the city with cliffs and walls. It\u2019s free if you\u2019ve bought a Dubrovnik card.",
          "This fort was part of our walking tour which gave us an insight in to the history of Dubrovnik and also a tour of game of thrones locations There is a 50kuna entry fee but if you retain the ticket you have 72 hours to use that ticket to get a ticket for the city walls for",
          "The Fort has a good position in that you get some stunning views. Not too much else to see inside. The ticket you buy for the City Walls also gives you entrance to the Fort (they don't tell you this). You can enter the Fort once for up to 3 days after you've purchased your",
          "We were visiting Dubrovnik for first time. Didi city walls and for lovrijenac. Amazing view and sunset",
          "We've seen this fortress many times from the harbour area near the Pile Gate but this was the first time we have been inside. The signage is not good but you can see where you need to head for - up the steps, and then more and more steps! Entry fee was KN 50, but the guy on the",
          "One of the most striking features of Dubrovnik when seen from the city walls, it is well worth the trip just outside of the Pile gate to visit Fort Lovrijenac. It offers some splendid views back over Dubrovnik. Note that they don\u2019t shout loudly about it, either here or at the",
          "Signage was missing, so by the time we climbed up and found the entrance and ticket price we turned away and preferred to be outside.",
          "Don\u2019t miss out visiting this fort, as it offers panoramic views of the Old Town, City Walls and the sea. Definitely worth it. If you get the Dubrovnik card or ticket to City Wall entrance is included.",
          "Good views of the old town. Should make it more clear that the ticket you purchase for the City walls gets you into the fort for free. We didnt know this and so had to pay again. Lots of steps. Worth visiting if you have spare time.",
          "As big game of thrones fans, it was so exciting to visit the famous site of kings landing. It costs 50 kuna to enter the fort. If you keep your ticket you get money off doing the city walls so make sure you do that too! Plus when you walk the walls, you get a really good view",
          "The walk up to the fort is worth the view you get of the old town. The walk is long but there are several places to stop, photograph, and rest along the path and steps.",
          "Be warned, if you plan to visit the Fort using the white city walls ticket (gaining entrance here for free), you must so within 3 days, plus you must have your Dubrovnik Card if you used that to buy your city walls ticket! I was denied entry due to it being longer, but luckily",
          "We took a walk around the top of the walled city of Dubrovnik and with it came free entrance to Fort Lovrijenac. Once you find the way to the Fort (not well signed) you see something different of the city. The bays nearby and the walk to the fort is worth the effort. It is a",
          "We hiked up here on a great sunny day took a few beers and soaked up the sun! Great views and very impressive I believe if you do the walls first you can get free entry we didn't know this and paid but still worth it there is toilets inside. Lots of steps some uneven ground so",
          "There is no written history to read or study and few artifacts to see. You visit the fort for the views of the harbour, the old town walls and the restaurants at the foot of the fort. There is no admission fee if you have your Wall ticket, otherwise it will s 50 kn per person.",
          "We visited this fort because we had some extra time on our last day in Dubrovnik. We arrived when they opened at 8 and were able to use our ticket to the wall to get in free. We spent about 45 minutes there, which was enough to walk around and take plenty of pictures. Go early,",
          "I am very happy that I have visited Fort and felt magnificent cultural, monumental and military base situated near Old town. It is wonderfull experince",
          "Being a Game of thrones fan, I was initially quite enthused to visit this fort. It looked interesting and I had made up my mind to go there after doing the city walls. The fort on top of the hill has a commanding view of the sea and the old town and so it was worth going there.",
          "Well worth a visit, free entry with your City Walls ticket. I think you have 3 days to use the City Wall ticket but don't quote me on that. Amazing views and has been used for filming GoT. It's a lot of steps again to get up there but it's definitely worth it.",
          "We walked the city walls on a Monday and went back to Dubrovnik and went to see the Fort on Wednesday. The extremely helpful chap on the ticket gate asked if we had our tickets from Monday which I did and we had free entrance to the Fort - result! I already had my 100 kuna out",
          "If you have a ticket for the Castle walls, then this includes entry to the Fort. Otherwise make sure you have Krona, as they do not accept Euros. Situated outside the city walls, it is about a 10 minute walk. Well worth the visit, even though there are about 300 steps to get to",
          "I came to the fort as part of a game of thrones tour. You get some excellent views of the sea and also Dubrovnik old town and the city walls. The only thing to bear in mine is the 168 steps (I think that\u2019s the correct number) but it\u2019s fine if you do them in parts. There is a",
          "This is another awesome place in Dubrovnik! Old, interesting and beautiful. Some high steps to get up there so if you struggle with things like that maybe give it a miss as there's no other way up. Once you're up there it's very nice, gorgeous in warm weather.",
          "If you know what my title refers too you know that you will go there. Is it worth the admittance, maybe. A tip is to buy the wall ticket and visiting this fort is included in the price.",
          "Have to be candid we saw this from afar as far as mount sard but it looked good in the dark hopefully your research will enable you to see it closer",
          "Fort Lawrence is near the entrance to the old city. The entrance price is 50kn, and it isn\u2019t too crowded inside. The views across to the old city are fantastic from here. This site is almost amazing for any \u2018game of thrones\u2019 fans as it is where \u2018the red keep\u2019 is set. A must see",
          "This fort is badly signposted but we found it. It is accessed up a flight of stone steps. There is no explanation before you get inside the entrance so be aware that entrance costs money and they do not take Euros. And the tourist day card does not cover it.",
          "We did this after the city wall tour and its only a 15 min walk from the Pile Gate but in reality it was another world away from the noise and chaos of touristy Dubrovnik. We had most of the fortress to ourselves and explored all the cool nooks and crannys until we got to the",
          "Outside the city walls is Fort Lovrijenac, the most important part of the defense system for western Dubrovnik, defending against attacks from both land and sea. It is now used as a theatre in the summer.",
          "Visitied as part of a Game of Thrones tour, though would have visited anyway. 50 kunas entrance and if you keep the ticket you only pay 100 kunas to visit the wall within a 72 hour period. Not bad. GOT fans will love it but again it has the most amazing views and history.",
          "Entrance free with City Walls ticket. Much less crowded than the City Walls and Old Town the afternoon we visited. Interesting old fort and spectacular views. Easy 5 stars.",
          "In amazing condition, this palace was used to film the Red Keep from Game of Thrones. Such an interesting visit. Also, an event was held there when we were dining at Nautika. The groups of peolple were welcomed by the sounds of middle ages trumpets. So events, such as weddings",
          "This fort is beautiful and offers a nice view over the sea but the most interesting part is that since it was an important part of the defense all the fort walls are 3 meters thick except on a small spot that could be used to destroy the fort from the city if got occupied by the",
          "Visited Dubrovnik last year & sadly ran out of time to visit Fort L on that visit. On this Croatian holiday we were in Dubrovnik for a day, so we made it our \u201cmust do\u201d Having now visited I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s not higher up on \u201cthings to do in Dubrovnik\u201d The views of the city",
          "I think we are some of the few people who haven't seen Game of Thrones, but if you have this is the Holy Grail for you. We counted 6 Games tour groups going around the fort! If like us you haven't seen it this is still a fab old fort to wander around and not too busy. We did",
          "Tons of stairs to climb- but well worth the views to old town.Our guide Ivan was informative and tolerant of our pace and interest in the show but not at a question and answer rate",
          "The climb to this castle which is located just 10 minute walk from the old town is steep but not difficult and you are up in the castle without realising. the days dudrovnik card includes the entry to this castle and the city walls and is recommended. The views of the adriatic",
          "This is definitely a must visit when you are in Dubrovnik. If you buy a ticket to walk on the ancient walls of Dubrovnik, you get this for free (it is included in the ticket). So you can visit both of them. It is really beautiful. There are a lot of filming locations from Game",
          "A must visit alongside the old town. Great to wander round the fortress whilst trying to recognise film sets from Game of Thrones. Fantastic views from the walls.",
          "Worth climbing to the top for the views but we counted 300 steps up to the top.Our ticket to the Old Town Walls included entrance to the fort.",
          "Even more amazing views of Dubrovnik can be seen from the fort. Especially as you can get a good view of the walls from another perspective. If you have tickets to the city walls you can get in for free. There isn\u2019t anywhere to buy food or drink inside. It\u2019s a steep climb",
          "Despite being very bare, this is an interesting site and offers many incredible views over the Old Town as well as the Adriatic. Definitely recommend visiting early or later on in the day as there is a steep flight of steps, and then additional steps inside the Fort.",
          "A must visit for anyone who is a fan of Game of Thrones or who has an interest in history. Get there nice and early before the crowds.",
          "Interesting fort and giving alternative photograph opportunities looking over old Dubrovnik. Not much to see inside the fort after taking the many steps up to it!",
          "If you bought a ticket to walk the city walls, save your ticket because it includes entrance to Fort Lovrijenac. Yes the 350 steps to get up can be intimidating but there are plenty of places to stop and take a break. Game of Thrones fans will love the fort, there were",
          "Definitely worth going to, especially if you\u2019re doing the walk walk as it\u2019s included in the ticket price. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit and imagining what it must have been like to fend off invaders. That said, you can do the whole fort in about 15-30mins",
          "If you already have a ticket you may aswell climb up as it is totally worth it. It\u2019s a lot cooler and shadier, but the stairs can be quite tough I won\u2019t lie. They aren\u2019t too bad in comparison to the walls as once you\u2019re up that\u2019s it, but very much worth it.",
          "Yes, there are a lot of steps to climb. But you will be rewarded with beautiful views. A must of course for GOT fans a lot of the interior of the red keep have been filmed here. The outside of the red keep is CGI. You will recognise a lot of spots from the series. It is also a",
          "We did walking tour of City Walls and quite told us that the same ticket gives you entrance to the Fort. It\u2019s in the perfect conditions! Feels like it was built yesterday! Until you are on the top of the Fort- you don\u2019t really appreciate how high this building is and how much",
          "Be aware. You need endurance to climb the maybe 350 steps to the Red Keep. Imagine the GoT staff carrying the heavy equipment upstairs. You' re among the privileged and carry nothing but your dreams up. Once at the top you will be rewarded with the most beautiful view on",
          "Don't let the steps scare you. There are plenty of places to take a break without holding up others. The views are spectacular and the GoT connections are great. DO NOT LOSE YOUR TICKET OR LET OTHERS CARRY IT! If you do not have it with you, you will be denied entry.",
          "Fort Lovrijenac (Lawrence) sits on an 37 m high sea cliff near the SW corner of old Dubrovnik's city wall. Its dramatic and imposing aspect has earned it the nickname \"Dubrovnik's Gibraltar.\" Originally built in the 11th century to repulse Venetian power, it has been modified",
          "If you plan to visit all the Game of Thrones locations, be sure to pay a visit to this fortress, the Red Keep was filmed there plus a few other locations. And it also provides a beautiful view over the Old City and the sea.",
          "We visited the city walls and the fort is included in the prize. I really loved the view from the top and the fact that it was not so crowded! There is a good toilet, but no place for drinks. Definately would recommend.",
          "We only went here because our ticket for the city walls allowed us entry here the next day. It's a quick walk through but gives great views and lots of GOT scenes are set here.",
          "when you buy tickects for the walls walk the fort is included- if you have the time it is worthwhile",
          "The fort entrance is included as part of the City Walls ticket, so hang on to your ticket, if you plan on visiting the fort after the City Walls. If you happen to visit the fort first, keep the fort ticket to get a discount off the City Walls ticket. It's also included as part",
          "The fort gives you an amazing opportunity to view the city from above. Be prepare however to climb many, many stairs, but it is worth the price and the workout. +1 if you are a Game of Thrones fan, you'll recognize the area ;)",
          "Free entry as part of city walls ticket. Steep climb up to the entrance and between each floor. This is a well preserved fort giving impressive views of the Old City. Used as location for Game of Thrones. We spent about half an hour there. Excellent value if you had free tickets",
          "A short walk away from the Old Town and up some steep steps, brings you to the Fort. You get a viewing point of the old Town and the surrounding areas.",
          "We visited after walking the city walls in the morning(admission included with walls ticket).great views,it was 10am and already very warm.it was nice and quiet at the time.there are a lot of steps but places to stop for a rest on way up.im pregnant so got a bit out of breath",
          "Remember your walls ticket also gains you entry here . Really interesting with great views of the old town . Lovely inlet just behind , where the locals appear to swim . Recommended",
          "I worried a little that not being on a tour would restrict the ease of accessing the fort, but pleased to say tickets were easily purchased and access very straightforward. There are no furnishings or interpretation boards, however the fort is imposing. The view of the old",
          "Another GOT filming spot (the Red Keep), and the views from the top were spectacular. If you have a Dubrovnik card - make sure you keep your city walls tickets -it includes entry into the Fort. If you don't have your city walls ticket (you get with your card when you go to a",
          "The view is amazing and it is not too difficult or hot as the wall. The entrance from the square is not adequately identified.",
          "Climbing up to Fort Lovrijenac rewards tourists with an utterly beautiful view of the walled city of Dubrovnik, especially on a sunny day! Better go early in the morning to avoid too much sweating and heat, or late in the afternoon to marvel at the fantastic site",
          "great spot, not visited as much as the old city walls so far less crowded, but so close you shouldn't miss it. offers quite different perspective and great views. compact site, moderate number of steps. On same ticket as the wall walk",
          "Stunning views of the city from here, much better than the city walls walk which is a little too close to things to really take it all in",
          "This place is great for panoramic views of Dubrovnik and the sea. (It is also the set for the Battle of the Black water for any game of thrones fans). 4 star review is because unless you have a guided tour, you have no idea what you are looking at. There are no signs or",
          "Fan of Game of Thrones? Or simply a fan of castles and history? I highly recommend buying the Ancient Walls ticket and start by walking the walls and after that, use that same ticket to visit Fort Loverijenac. The view from the top is beautiful and little path you have to take",
          "If you\u2019re GOT fan, must see Dubrovnik and it\u2019s ancient walls, fort Lovrijenac and Old town in general. Old town was filming location for Game of Thrones - Kings Landing and view from fort Lovrijenac is breathtaking. Fort doubles as a Red Keep in Kings Landing and it\u2019s",
          "Oh my it was so amazing place for a summer theatre! We went to see Midsummer night's dream and the Fort itself made the place magical including the real stars and the moon. We really recommend to see this place in this light too!",
          "The massive fort just outside the walls of Dubrovnik is quite something to tour. Although there is little inside to see other than the walls and fountain it has a spectacular view of Dubrovnik and the sea beyond. If you have walked the walls of Dubrovnik keep your tickets as",
          "If you\u2019ve already walked the wall and have time, make sure to do this. It was nice to find out that the admission is included with the ticket to walk the wall. It\u2019s worth seeing, but doesn\u2019t take much time.",
          "You must visit the fort (The Red Keep) from Game of Thrones during any visit to Dubrovnik Old. The climb up to the fort is a challenge but well worth it. The fort has a great atmosphere and the panoramic views from the top are fantastic. You do not know where to look first! The",
          "Came here as part of our Game of Thrones tour. Loved seeing all the areas where the programme was filmed and also loved seeing the view from Fort Lovrijenac. Must see view in Dubrovnik.",
          "One of the most iconic views of Dubrovnik + Lokrum island is certainly from here! Scan you city walls ticket within 3 days to enter. It doesn't take too long to see, 15 - 45 minutes or so. For any game of thrones fans, this is \"The Red Keep\" -- you certainly can appreciate the",
          "It was only through reading our guidebook that we were aware that our city walls ticket (in fact all part of our day pass) also allowed us into this fort. It is well worth climbing up to and for Game of Thrones fans essential viewing. Many scenes were filmed here and on the",

          "Went here as part of the Game of Thrones tour as a lot of the scenes were filmed here. What a fantastic place and at the time they were setting up for a Midsummer Nights Dream to be on here as well. The views from the top of the fort were spectacular and our guide was",
          "Great views of the fort and from the fort. Very near Old town and as someone mentioned a guided tour would be worth it.",
          "We were staying in Accommodation right below this Fort ( bottom RHS) so a visit was imminent.

          "The cost of a ticket to the Old Town walls also includes admission to the fort. The paths to the castle are very steep and uneven so not suitable for visitors with mobility problems. The views over the Old Town and surrounding areas make the effort worthwhile and there are",
          "great view of small rocky inlets, islands and old town. The biggest high would be for Game of Thrones fans as the fort is part of the red keep set. A must see for all, but there are a few stairs to get to the top.",
          "City wall tickets include entry to this fort and if you have any energy left after walking the city walls, this is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Because it is outside the city walls, you get great views of the whole walled old town. Well worth the climb.",
          "Around 160 steps to get up to it but well worth the effort, great views and lots of history so worth a Google before you go if you\u2019re not using a guide. No refreshments available in the Fort, but there are toilets. If you are paying for entrance it\u2019s 60Kn, but entrance is",
          "I recommend visiting this castle with a guide, who can tell you something about history of this place. It is much more interesting then walking around just with a camera. There are lots of nice views and good places to take a picture with your beloved one. Also, toilet is there.",
          "If you do the Wall Walk, your ticket includes entry to this castle, and it\u2019s well worth it. I don\u2019t watch GOT, but I\u2019m glad I made the effort to see this castle. It\u2019s very dramatic with stunning views. I got some amazing photos.",
          "The are quite a lot of stairs to get to the top of this place as one would expect but when you reach the top it will be worth it, I promise! Stunning 360 views plus an incredible view of old town Dubrovnik The entrance/walk way to it is just off the bus drop off point near the",
          "Climbed the 168 steps to see inside this fort near pile gate in Dubrovnik. Lots of game of thrones was filmed there which was really interesting . If u don\u2019t have a Dubrovnik card it\u2019s 50 kuna to get in but then you get 50 kuna off your city walls ticket so keep it amazing",
          "This is included in your ticket to the walls, but only if you go within 3 days. Otherwise it costs 50 KN to go in. You can get some superb views of the Old Town but just climbing as far as the ticket kiosk (which is what we ended up doing as we hadn\u2019t realised the walls ticket",
          "It is worth climbing this fort as it rewards you with stunning views over the old town of Dubrovnik.",
          "Make sure you save your ticket from walking the city walls. We were able to get in the next day after doing the walls for free. The views are beautiful. It is nice to see the old town from the other side. There are two beautiful coves to s e from the castle as well. Should you",
          "When you buy your i day Dubrovnik pass out includes your ticket for the fort and you will not be sorry",
          "Lovely fort which offers spectacular views back towards the old town and city walls . Nice cafes in a charming bay on the way up for refreshment",
          "You can enter with the city walls ticket; climbing to the top you can find another lovely view of Dubrovnik. There were also some GoT scenes filmed here. You should check it out!",
          "Short walk around Kings Landing provided alternative views of the city walls and town and free if you paid for the walls tour. The steps up might not suit the elderly or infirm.",
          "The fort is very interesting and offers good views. Since your fee is already paid for with your city wall ticket, do the city walls first, and then hop on over to the fort! It is just a little bit outside of old town.",
          "My wife and I visited Fort Lovrijenac at 1pm. We climbed the 100 or so steps to the fort and used our Dubrovnik Card to get in. It was very quiet. It's well kept and there are some lovely views. However, I would have appreciated more information on the construction and history,",
          "Great piece of history to explore and take in. Great views from the top which are perfect. Has toilets but would recommend taking water because on hot day you really feel it especially with all the stairs Would recommend to go check out!",
          "The Fort Lovrijenac is such a beautiful historical Fort. Game of Thrones show have filmed lots of scenes inside this Fort. The Fort has such a great angle to shoot a great photos of the Old Town of Dubrovnik.",
          "We had paid for the Dubrovnik city walls ticket, and so entry into Fort Lovrijenac was free (just show your city walls ticket). We did it on the same day, I am unsure if you can use it at a later date. The views of the city, city walls, and the water, from here were beautiful.",
          "If you want to pay for seeing nothing, then you should visit this. The only reason to go here would be to get a view of the old town, but there are far better spots for that.",
          "Amazing views from the top of the fort to Lokrum and Old Town. Must go!! Keep your eyes open for the architecture you are passing on the way to the fort.",
          "Nice view of the Old Town but nothing much about the history. Worth noting, however, that you can get entry to this Fort and the City Walls for 150hkr total.",
          "You get some nice views from up here. It wasnt very busy at 09:30 (admittedly on a day with no cruise ships). There is a toilet up there and you wall ticket is valid for use up to 3 days after issue (we used our wall ticket to gain access two days later) - there is a sign",
          "The entrance fee for this is included in the Walls ticket. Just as well because I would hate to pay the separate fee to visit this fort. Only GOT fans can appreciate the fort. It's practically empty inside and the view from the top is the only positive.",
          "Walking along the walls that encircle the city was the highlight of our visit. From the walls one has a great view not only of the city but also of the coast line. Our family was there over Easter week-end and were surprised how few people were actually walking in comparison",
          "It was a great walk up to the fort. Remember to save your ticket from the wall or you willl have to pay again",
          "We had no intention of visiting this fort until we found out it was included in the city walls ticket. I wouldn't pay for it separately but it was nice to go in and have a look around for no extra cost. When we went it was a lot less busy the the city walls so it was nice to",
          "My wife and I walked to the top! The fort is amazing and the views the most stunning in the world. I think there are about 200 steps to the top. Be sure to visit this fort, it was just sooooo cool! Worth a visit to the top!",
          "This is a pretty big castle with not much inside. It was part of the city walls ticket and as such it was definitely worth it.",
          "This fort is on a cliff 37m above the sea and built in the 16th century to protect the city from Venetian attack. You can get in free if you buy the city wall tour. It actually didn\u2019t take as long to,visit as we thought it would since it looks huge on the outside. Lots and lots",
          "The fort area is great to visit. It offers very nice views of the city. The fort houses the old city and, of course some very nice restaurants. If you chose the walking tour beware as it gets very hot. They do offer a few places to relax along the way and there is also a cafe,",
          "Situated near the harbour gate, a ticket to the Ancient City Walls gets you into the fort for free, so do not miss out. A key GOT filming location with good views of the old town. Again it could done with some information boards, luckiy our tour guide could give us the history",
          "This was the final activity for our day touring Dubrovnik Old Town. It\u2019s a bi5 of a climb to the top, but well worth it. The views overlooking the walls, city and coast is magnificent. Make sure you keep your \u201cWall\u201d ticket as this provides free access to Fort.",
          "The setting of the fort is stunning and worth the climb up the steps. The entry is included in the walls ticket - you can buy at either the walls or the castle - you can use on different days. But just one entry to each (walls and castle).",
          "Wonderful view of the old city and many of the Game of Thrones filming locations. Well worth the price to get in and see the area.",
          "Buying a ticket for the walls includes this fort. It is a bit of a hike but after the walls not too bad. The fort is a treasure and the views from the top back to the old city are amazing.Must do!",
          "This place is beautiful and the views breathtaking. I recommend the Dubrovnik Walking Tour (Red Umbrella) which takes in this fort. A must see if you are a GoT fan as it's used a lot. Note lots of steps to get to it but you can take it easy.",
          "If you love old forts, castles, fortresses, etc, you'll love this. Be sure to bring your ticket if you walked the old city walls, that ticket gets you in here as well. If you were strapped for time or simply didn't want to buy a ticket to go IN the fort you can still get",
          "We did the fort as part of the GOT tour but got to spend plenty of time there. The views are amazing and if you are a GOT fan many scenes were filmed there. As most parts of the old town It requires a lot of steps to get there but you will be rewarded once there. Even if you do",
          "Built upon a 37 meter high sheer rock overlooking the sea, fortress Lovrijenac is one of the most impressive locations in Dubrovnik. This detached fortress was of prime importance for the defence of the western part of Dubrovnik, both against attack from land and the sea.",
          "After city walls tour, we endend it at Fort Lovrjenac and I it was aaaamazing!!! You can see al the Game of thrones sites and walk to the top to enjoy sun and sea",
          "Living history is awesome in this original fortress. Stunning views of the old city and its wall are just part of the reward. The water colours today were sensational as you look back toward the old city. The old cannons are a bonus as is the tie to Game of Thrones. Man's",
          "This fort is stunning, overlooking the beautiful backdrop of the historic old town. The views of both the sea and the city are nothing short of breathtaking. It is worthwhile keeping your city walls entry tickets as these can be used within 72 hours to gain free entry to the",
          "It is a beautiful spot in front of the old city. It is one of the fortress of the city but it is not connected to the city and that gives the oportunity to get amazing views of the city. If you enjoyed games of Thrones it is one of the spots of the show but it worth the climb",
          "The fort is an excellent use of time theres a nice climb up but the panoramic view is amazing and amazing site that is a must see",
          "After a long day it seemed even more. Also to get to the fort and find they do not accept Euro is a pain when we had no Kona left. Fortunately the nice bloke behind the counter asked if we had been on the wall and we had our tickets so entry was free. I loved going inside the",
          "The Lovrijenac fortress is so so interesting, but the views of Dubrovnik and it\u2019s city walls are its best feature.",
          "Fort Lovrijenac is interesting but it is fairly small and there is not too much to see within it. Saying that, it's price is included in the city walls ticket so if you have already purchased a ticket to see the City Walls and have time, it is worth the trip because it offers",
          "This fort is magnificent. This is where games of throne is filmed and in the old town . The entrance to the fort is included in the walls ticket but I by the time you have climbed the ancient walls probably miss this attraction. Again greAt views of Adriatic sea and island",
          "A word of warning before you try to visit this place. It is included with the City Walls entry ticket, so if you visit the walls first keep your ticket, otherwise they will posture and threaten not to let you in. I argued with them for all I was worth explaining that the fact",
          "The fortress Lovrienac was built to further protect the city from attacks from the sea and from the land on a 37-meter rock. This fort is included with the Dubrovnik wall ticket and is located near the entrance / exit \"Of Pile\" from the Old City Dubrovnik.It provides a great",
          "This fort is included with the Dubrovnik wall ticket and provides a great vantage point to look out onto the walled city. There are quite a few steps to reach the fort as well as when moving between the floors. However, the views from the fort are worth the effort.",
          "Visited here late May \u201817, we didn\u2019t have a lot of time in Dubrovnik so our visit to the fort was a good spot for getting all of the great views of Dubrovnik, the city walls and all of the lovely town. The fee was only small compared to what the cost of the ticket was to walk",
          "Fort Lovrijenac, despite being impressively situated above the main gate into Dubrovnik\u2019s old city and steeped in history, seems to be visitable today mainly as a Game of Thrones filming location. It is used quite a lot in the show, and anyone who has watched most of the",
          "Recently visited the Fort whilst in Dubrovnik. This isnt for people who have any physical restrictions as there are lots of stairs. Beautiful views out to the sea and over old Dubrovnik and surrounding areas. Very little information when in this attraction and even less in",
          "Ticket for Walls includes a Fort Lovrijenac. There is a lot of stair but climb up is worth for wonderful view of Walls, Dubrovnik and sea. Fort is interesting but not known as Walls.",
          "Neat sea fortress built on a high rock where Game of Thrones was filmed (King's Landing.) If you are a fan of the show, this is a must do for you. If you are not, which I am not, you will still find it interesting and get amazing pictures of the city walls from a different",
          "As long as you visit it in the same day, so we did the walls walk in the morning had lunch and headed over to the fort, through Pile gate and the back streets. On the way back we headed down the stairs around to west harbour around the wall, across the beach and into pile gate",
          "We started here before hitting the city walls, and our entry fees were later knocked off the price of the city walls ticket. I'm not fit but managed the 160+ uneven steps up to the top with a couple of stops. You can get some good photos across to the old town and Lokrum",
          "This fort has some incredible coast line views and for any fans of Games of Thrones it will be a mandatory pitstop. It is inclusive with a 3 day Dubronvik card.",
          "Passed this place several times before finding there are a couple of ways to get to it. Fairly steep steps and then a cost to get in but not dear. Apart from the view across to the old town walls and the sea there is not a great deal inside so only worth a few photos and a half",
          "We really enjoyed exploring the Fort. The climb up provided a beautiful view of the deep blue water and the medieval walls of Old Town. From the top of the fort, you get breathtaking views looking down at Old Town and out to sea. It doesn't take long to see everything but it",
          "The view up is stunning but around the foundation is an interesting piece of shallow water with some boats as well as a place for fishing. We stay just around the corner and each day, we see families having a great time sunning themselves, some days even swimming. Just before",
          "We visited as part of a game of thrones tour. Entry is free if you've bought a city walls ticket. It's amazing how many scenes were filmed in such a small area. Fantastic views to the old town and black water bay. 280 steps up so be warned it's a climb.",
          "This is great to look at from the outside and insider you get great views, both out to sea and over the Old Town. Its an impressive military structure. You get in free with your ticket for the walls",
          "You aren't told but your city walls tickets include a visit here! And I'd definitely advise it, it's beautiful with gorgeous views of the walls we had just walked round.",
          "I didn\u2019t have allot of time, so toured through the fort on my own, without a guide. The construction and building is impressive. Interesting views of the old town. The walk up and grounds around are very nice on a hot day.",
          "It's included in the old walls ticket and I definitely recommend popping over to see. If you want to come separately it cost 50 Kuna.. I don't think it's worth it on its own but it does have a good view of the city.",
          "This is a very popular attraction for fans of Game of Thrones, as many scenes from the hit show were filmed here. There\u2019s not a lot to see in the fort itself but, since it\u2019s located outside the town walls, it\u2019s definitely worth visiting for the incredible views it offers of the",
          "Great views from the top, worth the climb Take your own water but there are toilets at the top. Strong shoes helpful.",
          "Fort Lovrijenac or also known as St. Lawrence Fortress lies outside the city walls at the western entrance to the city. It also double as the Red Keep in King's Landing as a location base for the Game of Thrones. There is a charge of 50 kunas entrance to go inside and look",
          "First your walls ticket gives you access to this fort as well & you can go the following day if needs be, but check as this may change. There is not a great deal to see but some go on the \"Game of Thrones\" tour. It is a great approach to it and the views of the coast and",
          "If you're not a Games of Thrones follower then the Fort is probably only worth visiting for the view of the Old Town, which is best in the late afternoon. This is worthwhile in itself, especially as te entrance price is included in the Wall ticket, which makes this good value.",
          "This was a good place to visit and if you do the Old City Wall, your ticket includes entrance into the Fort as well. It has a lot of stairs to access it, so have comfortable walking shoes, and rest if you have to. Fort Lovrijenac can be explored in about 45 mins - 1 hr",
          "Admission is included if you bought a ticket to see the walls, or it's 50 kuna (about \u20ac7) to see it without the walls. You get some great views of the old town, especially at sunset. However, I'm annoyed with how the place is run - we tried to leave just before closing time",
          "It is a trek to get up there, but like others have stated, it's worth it. Each step along the way, the views are great. Looking over to Dubrovnik from this fort is an interesting vantage point. I wanted to come because of GoT, but non-fans will love for the views alone. Take",
          "We decided to visit Fort Lovrijenac as entrance to this was part of the Ancient City Walls ticket. I am glad we did not pay for a ticket. Although an impressive Fort and views from here are stunning, there really isn't much inside the Fort, so just a quick walk round.",
          "Not as crowded as the City Wall but just as interesting with amazing views. The day we were there it was hosting a wedding so that was pretty cool.",
          "You can pass this attraction if you want - its situated near a wonderful restaurant (the Dubravka) from where you can get a great view of the fort while sipping on your chilled beer!!",
          "The view of the walled Old Town and the view to the other side of the Fort were well worth the steep climb up to the it. It was free with my Dubrovnik card and I would have paid regardless as I knew the views would be amazing! And they were. Would be better if there was some",
          "Quite a climb to get to the Fort and then to the top but worth it to get great views back over the Old Town. Lots of interesting spaces inside and out but no displays or information about what they were or its history which is a shame. Maybe these could also feature info about",
          "Fort Lovrijenac has a modest admission fee, or free if you bought the city walls ticket. About 5-10 minute walk from Old Town. It has a large courtyard with window views of the Adriatic. Upper level provides you with a nice panoramic view of Old City and its walls. This fort was",
          "Fantastic views from every level. Worth making the effort to walk up the steps to the top. Love Dubrovnik",
          "Entry is free with the city walls ticket. Although there are plenty of steps leading up to the fort, don't let that put you off. The views are incredible. A must do for game of thrones fans as well!!",
          "Entrance to the Fort was included in the ticket to walk the Dubrovnik Ancient Walls, so we figured we might as well climb all the stairs to see the wonderful views. The views over the old walled city are fantastic, but there\u2019s not much else to do. They did have toilets, so that",
          "Visited as part of a Game of Thrones Tour. Beautiful medieval building with stunning views over the Old Town and the Adriatic. Great for spotting locations in GoT too (it is the Red Keep afterall).",
          "We had the pleasure of visting this fortress on a G.O.T tour. It was interesting to see and the views from here are amazing. You must climb 172 stairs to get up there but it is well worth it. Wear comfortable shoes!",
          "Really worth a visit for the views. Get a different perspective of the Old town and the coastline. Very interesting too.",
          "The ticket to this fort is combined with the ticket to walk around the city walls. My recommendation is to buy the ticket early in the day when in town and then climb the fort first in the late afternoon to get the best photos across the small bay to the old town. Then climb the",
          "Head up to this Fort for sunset. It is a gorgeous old fort with great views of Old City and the Adriatic. Your entry fee will also give you a discount to the Old City Wall walk (or you can visit with your Old City Wall entry ticket). Worth a trip if you are in the area.",
          "right across from the walled city is Fort Lovrijenac. It has beautiful rock work and is really neat to see.",
          "If you have already paid for the walls, bring your ticket to get in free, otherwise you will need to pay 50k per person even if you have bought a Dubrovnik Card. Not much in the way of information but excellent views back on the old city",
          "Not that much to see inside, unless you are a Game of Thrones fan, but the views to the city and the sea are magnificent and the fortress itself is an intriguing construction. The climb up is steep, lots of stairs, but the journey is the best part.",
          "It's also called a \"Dubrovnik's Gibraltar\" a fortress outside the walled old town. It's a triangle shape with three terraces. The wall thickness of the fortress is from 33ft to 24inches in some places. Two drawbridges lead to the fort with inscription above saying \"Freedom is",
          "The views are really spectacular here of Dubrovnik. It's a great place to take pictures and has been a Game of Thrones set so if you like that sort of thing it has another interesting angle.",
          "Definitely worth buying the Dubrovnik pass as you get into this attraction free. You don\u2019t need to do the wall first. Interesting place to visit, definitely a challenging climb. Fantastic panoramic views of the old town.",
          "The price of entry to the fort is included in the city walls. We visited it on a separate day which didn't seem to be a problem. Great views of the city wall from the fort and also the little harbour below it. We also saw a small beach from the top of the fort which we sought",
          "It's an effort to get here, lots of steps and inside it is very stark and empty, but the views are well worth the effort. I wish they had more information about it's history and the various rooms. Enjoyed it though - could be better",
          "This is a must visit for any GOT fans out there. The fortress aka the Red Keep is the location of many scenes on the show. The GOT tours will bring you here and explain some background and fun facts of the different scenes. There isn't too much else to see here, but it does",
          "Fantastic views once you get to the fort. Take care with children there are no safety barriers. Its a steep climb up. There is no mention of an entrance charge until you have made the climb. there is a connection with Game of Thrones...went over my head!",
          "The view from here is excellent. It might be a little hard for old people to climb here. Please note. The ticket price here is included the city wall ticket, so being affordably priced.",
          "Visited here on a GOT tour as did not realize admission was included on the Dubrovnik Walls ticket. Very interesting to see how HBO used it for GOT. Fort is well kept up. There is a steep climb to get to it but is well worth it. Views are fabulous. A must see. Is beautiful all",
          "This attraction is included in the ticket for the City Walls. The views are great but there is nothing inside the building and no history information to read about. Not worth paying for separately.",
          "This is a must visit place if you are in Dubrovnik. If you have the city tour ticket it is free. Or if you buy de old city wall tickets, the ticket to visit this place is the same, no need to pay extra. From here you will have breathtaking views of the sea and old town",
          "We booked on the afternoon GOT walking tour and knew that we needed to buy entrance fee so we purchased the city wall ticket (which includes Fort) and did that early in the morning. Climb to fort is worth the view across the Pile bay to the city walls. For GOT fans its a must",
          "50 Kuna (approximately \u00a36) or free with entrance ticket for the City Walls (150 Kuna) on the same day or next only. Two ways to enter the stairwell leading up, both at Pile Gate. One is by taking steps down in front of Tourist Information and around bay but be careful as you",
          "The climb up the fort rewards with amazing views over the old town, mountains and the sea. Keep the ticket for a discount on the city wall.",
          "We visited here twice. Once as we had purchased a City Walls ticket which gave us access to the Fort. Secondly as part of the Game of Thrones Walking Tour. On this occasion we had to pay the entrance fee of 50Kuna. However, I understand that if you pay for this separately,",
          "If you take a tour of the Old City walls, entrance to the Lovrijenac Fort is included in your ticket price. Access is not very clearly sign posted, but it is down some steps directly next to the main bus stops at Pile Gate at the alleyway, \"Ulica Svetoga Durda\". It's quite a",
          "We bought tickets independently of the city walls tour, but it was still good value for the spectacular views of the old town. Only downside was that there wasn't any information about the history of the castle, although the majority of visitors were there for the Game of",
          "Especially where the Game of a Thrones was picturized.. it's a step climb of over 170 steps to reach the Fort, but the view is Mahican from there-on...",
          "We visited here as part of a Game of Thrones tour. You do have to pay to go in, but keep the ticket as you can use it to get money off the ticket for the city walls. Lots of steps so may be a bit tiring for some, but worth a visit for the great views. For those GOT fans,",
          "You get taken here with all the game of thrones tours but if you don't go on one of the tours it's worth going to for the great views of the old town. It's 50 kuna entrance or it's included in the city walls ticket.",
          "If you buy a ticket for the walls (and you should), the is included in your ticket and it's one of the best views of the city",
          "Visited the Fort as part of a Game of Thrones Tour. Lots of steps and lots of climbing but absolutely worth the view. The location offers a unique perspective on Old Town and the city walls. Fun seeing the GoT scenes that were filmed there too.",
          "This fort is just outside the old town and offers a good view of the town itself. There are better spots to view the old town of course. For me it was not really a must do.",
          "Nice view from the fort the view of old city from the top. City wall ticket can be reused in entering the port",
          "Great place, affords nice views to the Old Town and Lokrum. Famous for Game of Thrones, but you don't have to be a fan to appreciate this. Quiet, away from the Bustle of the Old Town maybe many people who walk the walls are too tired to climb up to it??? Maybe a little brief if",
          "You only come to this fort for three reasons: (1) you're a GOT fan, (2) you love stunning views of the old town and the Adriatic, (3) you love old fortresses. For me, it's all three, so I enjoyed my visit there. If you bought a city walls ticket, you can get in here for free",
          "Fort another old history over look old city. View was great as watch full picture of old town and city wall. Make sure you bring along with you the city wall ticket which will get cheaper for fort visit. Otherwise the entrance is 50k, no euro or card accept. Make sure you",
          "The fort is cool to visit, but it's main highlight are the views it offers of Old Town. It's included in the City Wall ticket, so I'd recommend the visit. However, I wouldn't say it's worth going out of your way if you're tight on time. There were also people there who opted",
          "Save your ticket if you do the city walls as you get in free to the fort. Basically just walk up to a good vantage point and back down but its fun to see the city from a different angle outside of the walls",
          "Our visit to Dubrovnik was leisurely and we had plenty of time so we took in this fort just outside the old city. As with many such sites in the area it does represent a bit of a climb, but it is well worth it. The views are very nice. Then again, there is no real museum and I",
          "Must visit place , directly before the pile gate you go right and you walk through some houses . It's on a hill so you have to go up lot of steps but it's easy . Excellent views overlooking the old town & its walls, Preferably go late afternoon as you'll not sweat but also",
          "As a landmark, the fort is interesting and offers incredible views of the Old City. Unfortunately, there is little information on offer within the fort to describe its significance to the area, but since it is included in the price of a tour around the City Walls, it is worth",
          "Stunning views; save your city walls ticket. It includes entry here. It's a bit tricky to find the entrance, but it's definitely worth the climb up. They show plays here during the Dubrovnik festival. Very cool.",
          "Entry is included in your city walls ticket. The climb is steep but if you have done the city walls walk/ climb earlier then it's a breeze... the views are fantastic. Great spot for pictures.",
          "Visited this as part of a Game of Thrones tour. There are many steps and it is very warm in the heat of the day!. Our tour was at 5pm for 2.5 hours and it was quite exhausting. Great views and some interesting history. It is a venue for plays regularly. Our tour gave us",
          "Your old town wall ticket is valid for this fort as well! The view from the fort of the old town is definitely worth the climb of stairs. There is not much else.",
          "Fort Lovrijenac occupies this tantalizing position overlooking the Old Town but whereas the Old Town has life occurring within its walls the fort is essentially moribund. We had entrance to it via the wall walk ticket and we accessed Fort L by taking the walkway and steps just",
          "Take the ticket from the city walls as you will need it to get free access. Brilliant, breathtaking views but a lot of litter and 'work' going on when we visited. Go at sunset for lovely photos.",
          "It looks impressive from the outside. And the views from the top are incredible. Worth the climb? Probably if you are a GOT fan just to say you've been. I've been highly impressed by the cleanliness of Dubrovnik. Very little litter and mess. However the fort is the exception",
          "For Game of Thrones fans this is the Red Keep. The entrance ticket is the same one you use to get into the city walls. There are beautiful views of the fort that you can see from the walls as well. If you are in the Old City you might as well walk over and check it out.",
          "Another must for GOT fans - this is the Red Keep. There isn't much to actually see and you really need to be on a GOT tour to have the scenes explained. There are, however, spectacular views over the city, which is worth the entrance fee. There are about 200 steps to get to the",
          "An old fort, its located a few minutes walk (at the top of quite a few stairs) from the old town. There's excellent views from the top. A bit pricey on the entrance fee though, given aside from the views there isn't anything else - the inside of the building lacks any",
          "Definitely worth doing after you've done the city walls especially if you are a Game of Thrones fan. About a 10 min walk from the city walls and that includes the steps up. We were ready to pay to go in but the person at the kiosk asked if we had tickets for the city walls so we",
          "This fort (in English i think it is called St Lawrence fort) was a particular highlight of our trip. There is not a lot there (it's essentially an empty fort) but the views are spectacular. We stayed admiring the view for about 2 hours. We went late in the evening (it stays open",
          "Access is free once you've paid for the city walls, so I recommend anyone to climb up the steps and look back at the city walls. Also the view of the little harbour is beautiful. Essentially the fort is a viewing point, there's nothing inside to see.",
          "There's 3 reasons why you should visit Fort Lovrijenac. The fort entrance ticket is included in the city walls ticket. The views of the old town, walls and Adriatic sea all together is breathtaking. If you are a Game of Thrones fan, you cannot miss this place! Also note there",
          "The castle itself is hollow and nothing is fancy. However if you are Game of Thrones fan, then this place is one of the holy place :) The view from above the castle is quite amazing, you can directly can see the cliff and the ancient wall in the opposite way.",
          "The fort offered fantastic views from the top but other than that it was a bit disappointing inside.",
          "It is worth the climb (do it early in the morning) to see this place. Partially restored fort where theatrical productions are staged. Some cannons on the top but the views are the stars here.",
          "It is nice that the price of this tour is discounted off the City Walls tour as they complement each other well. I got very nice pictures of each from the other.",
          "Simple but bold fort which has a high position looking over the cove and the old town. Gives great overview of he old town and is the perfect compliment to visiting the walls. We found it initially hard to fin and ended up further away at another viewpoint. If you follow the",
          "Its a bit of a climb up the steps but worth it as the views are amazing especially over the old town. There is very little in terms of facilitates. The cost was 50Kuna each but as an easier alternative to going round the walls then this is worth doing. Tip: take water and don't",
          "We visited this fort during a private walking tour. The fort has amazing layers of history from Roman to Venetian to Hapsburg to Croatian rule. It is now used for the theater festival in Dubrovnik during the summer.",
          "Beautiful views, so amazing to see where so much of game of thrones was filmed. A must to any fan. Lots of steps so avoid the midday heat.",
          "If you want to take a picture of the city wall, it's recommended to walk up to the Fort Lovrijenac. Stay away from the crowd and still have a stunning photo.",
          "We were told as part of our game of thrones tour to not miss going in to this fort. But after going it I didnt feel like it was worth the 7 euros. Its a nice view from there but there are many other spots. Definitely wear comfortable shoes if you're planning on doing this",
          "I went to the Fort to see A Midsummer Night's Dream. There are a million stairs to get up to the fort, so be prepared for a sweaty arrival at the top! There are great views of the Adriatic, but not much else to see of the Fort.",
          "I went in here as my ticket for the city walls gives you free entrance into this as well. If I had paid the 50 kunas just to go in here then I would have been disappointed. It gives nice views over to the dubrovnik city walls, but there is absolutely no information about the",
          "Amazing Fort which served as the Red Keep in Game of Thrones. If you are a fan then this is a must for you, if you are not then is an amazing structure which offers great views of the whole city.",
          "This is a must see if you are interested in the game of thrones series. Many of the scenes were shot in or near the fort. The fort also gives a great view of the city itself. In my opinion, the view from the fort is better than the city walls.",
          "Not part of the main city 30kuna to enter for an empty space. A couple of GOT scene were shot here. Other than a look around . Nothing more to offer",
          "If you have about two hours of time you should definitely see this fort! A breathtaking view from the top to the sea and Dubrovnik!",
          "After walking the city walls we decided to have a look around the fort as it's the same ticket, it took us longer to walk up to the fort then it did to walk around it nice view from the top of the fort but the view from the wall was better not really any point of climbing the",
          "This is free with the ticket for the city walls so you should definately give it a visit if you've bought a ticket for the. Worth going to and climbing to the top for the views over old town. It's not too strenuous a climb to the top.",
          "The fort is a great visit and is a game of thrones filming location (Joffreys name day tournament). The bay on the other side from the old town has some lovely local beach bars which serve reasonable food with great views.",
          "I visited the fort, on my own, and after scaling the hundred or so steps, found I only spent 15 mins there taking photos of the fort, and views, which are stunning... Did listen in on a small group tour, to learn a little more, (as there are no story boards or information any",
          "This fort is something unique, truly! Although a bit expensive, in my opinion, since you're basically paying just for the view of the old town.. anyway, the view is indisputable breathtaking. Of course, it's also amazing for any Game of Thrones fans, since a lot of scenes were",
          "Cool fort with amazing views of Old Town and the bay. Definitely worth a visit before venturing to the city walls. Probably best to do on a tour though, in order to get the full history as there is no information provided at the fort.",
          "You can buy a pass that includes both the fort and the city walls. The fort is interesting to walk around-especially if you are a Game of Thrones fan. There are a lot of Thrones tours. There were some nice views from here.",
          "Not much to it. You climb up and walk around the \"balconies.\" Go to get some good views and take some pictures. You might learn more if you are on a tour.",
          "The fort itself has not much to offer on the inside except some of dubrovniks best views which is astounding. If you buy a ticket in your get 50 kona off if you enter the city walls within 24 hours which is good deal. The fort was scene to some parts of the game of thrones",
          "Not much to see on the inside but offers fantastic views. Worth a visit and included in your city wall walk admission ticket.",
          "Great view but not much else so i wouldnt recommend the 172 (or so) steps if you havent purchased either the city pass or walls tour. Seems most people visit this fort as its connected to game of thrones but dont go ou of your way especially. The harbour below does have a nice",
          "Worth seeking out and is part of the city walls tour. Not a lot of historic details inside but the views are stunning. Worth the visit.",
          "While watching a fort from City Walls it looks like it is scene from some highbudget Hollywood movie. Fort itselfe isnt that much full of content, but walking on fort give you some kind of different expirience.",
          "They were setting up for a Game of Thrones banquet as we were walking around but other than this being the main site for filming the series (which I've never seen) there's nothing to see. It is a vigorous walk up to it from the walls so go when it's cool during the day",
          "All forts are beautiful, but Lovrijenac is something special, it is not connected to rest of the walls, and therefore it look more robust. it's built on rock and really look like something from GoT!",
          "Just a short walk from old town but mostly forgotten by many. Quiet and atmospheric with great views.",
          "Just a quick walk from the City Walls, this fort is MUCH less crowded, smaller, and provides a beautiful, different perspective of the walls. Also the site of the Red Keep in the Game of Thrones. It was included in our City One Day Pass. Amazing structure still beautifully",
          "Just to the western side of the Old Town, you'll find the pathway and entrance to Fort Lovrijenc. If you purchase the Ancient City Walls ticket for 150 Kuna, this is included in your ticket. Built on a 37 metre high rock overlooking the sea, it follows the contour of the rock,",
          "Located on the western side of the Old town, anyone who watch Game of Thrones will know this is the famous fliming location for it. It is also one of the most impressive locations in Dubrovnik. Built upon a 37m high sheer rock overlooking the sea, the view is amazing. Worth the",
          "Included in City wall tour ticket... Fun getting to Fort by avoiding waves on our route to the fort... \ud83d\ude01 Not that much to see but ok for short visit probably main attraction is the views over Dubrovnik old town from here... Worth the climb up for the views alone..",
          "50kuna to enter but if u do the city walls u can enter for free. Just show your city walls ticket. Great views. Just outside the gate of the old town. Included in the Game of Thrones walking tour. They filmed a little sequence there. It is only a shell of the fort but worth a",
          "For only 50 kuna, there is the entry to the fortress, great views of the Old City and the Adriatic Sea and some serious exercise on the many flights of stairs. Recommended.",
          "It took a while to reach the fort, but the view on top was spectacular. This attraction is best during the evening time in order to enjoy the sunset. Our ticket to the city walls included this attraction. Bring drinks since there are not any shops on top.",
          "There are lots of steps but once up them it is worth the view. There isn't much there but we spent a while just enjoying the views and chilling out. It is part of the Dubrovnik card or if you bought entrance to the city walls you can use the same ticket to gain entrance to",
          "It is a big treck of many flights of narrow stairs to get to the top, but once you're up there you are rewarded with beautiful views of the old city and the Adriatic.",
          "We visited (paid extra) this Fort as part of our Game of Thrones tour. It was optional but we were glad we paid the additional amount as the history, stories from the TV series, and view for pictures were unmatched. We did NOT walk the city walls, but instead enjoyed the height",
          "As other reviews, well worth the climb up the stairs and expect to be very busy in summer. The entrance fee was included as part of the old city walls entrance. We did this after the old city walls and it gives great views. Definitely recommend. Only need a short time, 10-15",
          "After climbing all the steps to get there the fort afforded great views over the city walls. It was fun working out Game of Thrones locations and the toilets were surprisingly good.",
          "Visit the Fort as well as the city walls to complete the experience. Great views and photo opportunities.",
          "This is worth a visit, be warned lots of steps to climb but worth the views as you get about the fort and look out in all directions. heard it can be very busy in summer season so glad we got there when it was only us wandering around enjoying it at our lesiure",
          "We enjoyed our trip to the fort, included in our 3 day Dubrovnik card. Definitely worth visiting. The views are incredible. No limit on how long you can be up there, it is open from 8am until about 7.30pm. There are toilets inside",
          "This fortress is located just to one side of the main city walls, on a rocky perch above the waves. It is wonderfully photogenic structure which is probably why \"Game of Thrones\" used it for filming. There is not all that much to see inside, to be honest- just a flag and a few",
          "This has excellent views of the sea and one side of old Dubrovnik. It's included in the price of the city wall tour. There is a steep climb to the entrance. A private party was being arranged for later in the evening we visited and there were fireworks afterwards.",
          "The sea looking down from the cliff beside the entrance to the fortress is very beautiful and in early April, many flowers were blooming. It was a pretty good adventure that I went on because it was free as I went to the Dubrovnik city wall tour. Personally, I think that",
          "It is close to the old town. In the inner part there is not much to see. But the exterior is very nice. There are cannons and has a very nice view of the old city. Worth a visit. If you visit the great wall around the old city, the tickets are not charged. But you must keep your",
          "This independent Fortress was built on a rock on the west side of the Old Town off Fort Bokar to provide added defense for the west side of the Old Town. The wall exposed to the adriatic seas was said to have ultra thick walls to fend off incoming enemy firepower whereas the",
          "We did not have time to go inside but were told that there is not really that much to see there. However, it is a beautiful part of the old city of Dubrovnik.",
          "We visited as part of a walking tour and the steep stairway up to the \"red keep\" was well worth it. Amazing views from the top!",
          "The entrance fee to Fort Lovrijenac, aka the Red Keep (interior) is included in the 150 Kuna that we paid for the Ancient City Walls. It is a detached segment from the city walls, but almost every GoT tour in the city will visit this fort. As some have pointed out, the view",
          "Even if you don't want to pay 50 hrk entrance fee, climp the stairs and take a wonderful pic! Inside there is't much more then the same view from different angle.",
          "This was included in our city wall ticket and we almost didn't go but so glad we did. The walk over was very pretty, around a nice cove and through some neighborhoods that were very pretty. The views were great from the fort but it was also just nice walking through the",
          "There is a bored man to take your entance fee, and that is all the information you get, as there are no information boards or leaflets. There is a nice view from the top, as there are from many locations in Dubrovnik. The only fact I learned with certainty is that scenes from",
          "Worth of climbing, then again, Dubrovnik is pretty much climbing, you will have calfs of iron and sore feet. Still, go for it!",
          "Whilst this fort is not directly connected to the city walls, it's entrance fee is included so you can either start here or if you leave it until last and if you can still climb up, don't miss this! It's an impressive piece of work, and whilst there's not much to see on the",
          "The Fort was the 1st stop on our GoT tour through Dubrovnik. Many of the scenes are filmed here. It's best to go with a guide if you want details about the show and the Fort itself. It's a bit of a walk to reach the Fort. Lots of steps. There is a small fee to enter, which",
          "Historically very interesting and the views are amazing. Quite a few steps to climb. If you visit the Franciscan monastery afterwards, it cosrs 50 kuna less for entry fee.",
          "a wonderful view from the top of Lovrenjac. During the summer some events are take place there. Worth to visit during some concert night or just cool down inside, during hot day :-)",
          "If you want a view point to look back to the old town, this is the place to go too plus it's less crowded.",
          "So if you are a Game of Thrones fan, you would like to o there. A lot of scenes are shoot there. They have an entrance fee which is not a big one, and the view to the old city is just amazing. Even if you don't want to o inside just go to see the view.",
          "You need to find the steps just outside the Pile gate near nautilus restaurant to access this little treasure. In it's own right, Fort Lovrijenac has not got a lot to see, what it does have is some of the most stunning views of the town and the famous city walls. We stood at the",
          "Initially came to see the sight because Game of Thrones was filmed here, however I found the scenary to be much more breathtaking than what is seen on screen. There is definitely no CGI to enhance the authentic of the old limestone structure and the water.",
          "Old fortress well worth visiting to check out where they filmed the Battle of the Blackwater for Game of Thrones, as well as for some very nice views back into Dubrovnik from the top level.",
          "We did this only because it was part of our city wall tickets. Nice views but not any more spectacular than the wall. Children will enjoy the cannon but there is little else worth the trek up to the top. I do not recommend for anyone with limited physical ability.",
          "You walk down the steps by Gallus restaurant and come out by the sea then walk up the steps to the fort. If you have a ticket from the city wall walk you can use it to get in free but it must be that day or next day only. The fort has wonderful views and a peaceful place to",
          "Yet again lots more stairs to reach the top but once you get there the views out to see and over the Old city is breathtaking. If you keep the admission ticket from the city walls you get in free here with the same ticket.",
          "If you are a GOT fan then you would love this place of Red Keep. You must do this place as it's included in the Dubrovnik city walls tickets. It's a long walk and stairs so carry lots of water. The view of the walls and old city from the fort is amazing, the whole city looks",
          "From Lovrijenac fort you can have the best view of the walls of Dubrovnik and Pile gate. It is a quick walk out of the city to get there, and you have to climb some stairs. If you do the walking of the walls, try to visit the fort on the same day since the ticket gives access to",
          "Allow 30-45 minutes for this one. It is quite empty inside so mainly views on the walled city is the main attraction (definitely worth the climb).",
          "We climbed up 3 hours before sunset to when the sun's rays were making the old town all the more picturesque.",
          "Very well preserved ancient fort. Moderate climbing up the hill. Used for many bloody fighting and Cersei/Little Fingers scenes in the Red Keep of Game of Thrones",
          "We went up the fort because it was included in the ticket for the walled-city. After much climbing (the stairs)...we reached the top and the view from there was awesome! We could see the clear water below. Worth going.",
          "Fortress outside walled old town Dubrovnik used in Game of Thrones as the Red Keep. The setting is beautiful with great views of the city. Worth the walk up the hill.",
          "Great views of Old Town! Interesting objects inside, nice staff too! Don't forget, free entry if you purchase a City Walls walk. This site did close at 3pm when we went though, so be sure to check the hours of operation before going! :) Don't miss this unique view! Once you",
          "Lovrijenac Fortress, or St. Lawrence Fortress, is just outside the city walls of Dubrovnik. We visited after walking the walls. Admission to the walls also covers the fortress on the same day, so try to visit both. The fortress has an interesting history. In the 11th century,",
          "Huge fortress to explore! Loved the views from the top especiall around the Aegean Sea and back over to walls surrounding Dubrovnik Stari Grad. The ground floors are impressive too and even the views walking up to the fortress from outside, overlooking Dubrovnik.",
          "We realized most people give this fort a miss but it should be a must do if visiting the city. Especially if you've bought the ticket for the city walls as the ticket covers this fort too. You'll get spectacular views of the old town and surrounding neighborhood from the top.",
          "Lovely views of the Old Town, plenty of photo opportunities. Difficult to find out much about the Fort unless you are on a guided tour so would probably do that next time. Make sure you keep your ticket and you'll get discount on the city walls visit.",
          "Built on a cliff, not particularly beautiful, but very imposing fortress, through which comes a nice climb paths through the park, and that offers beautiful views of the city and the sea.The interior is interesting, but not as views from the top of the stone protector of the",
          "Many tourists overlook this fort, but it should not be missed. Climb to the top and you will find stunning views of the Adriatic Sea, the Old Town, the Island of Lokrum, and more. Don't miss the history - every corner tells a story. Soak it all in and then enjoy sitting on one",
          "Visited this Fort on the Game of Thrones Tour. Lots of scenes have been shot here. It has the best view and we got to see the Old City and the Adriatic from a completely different angle. There are a lot of steps to climb up to the top. It may tire out those not fit enough, or",
          "We visited as part of the Game of Thrones Tour and it was interesting to see how the fort had been used in the series. The actual history was interesting too. I have to confess to being more interested in the fact that 2Cellos were filming their performance of the \"Game of",
          "This fortress is also a \"part\" of the City Walls deal. There's not so much to see here but the view was great!! I went here when it was raining hard and it made a some kind of waterfall at the stairs",
          "We walked the walls on the first day but due to the rain in the afternoon we could not do this. The ticket is valid for one entrance so you can split the days that you do the walls and the Fort even though both are included in the price. We got there around 10.00 and there",
          "Just a short stroll after finishing the tour of the city walls, not to be missed, amazing views of the old town and where GOT was filmed. Worth climbing right to the top, was not busy at all later in the day when we visited.",
          "The Old City Walls and Fort Lovrijenac are part of Dubrovnik history, so you have to do both, may not be on the same day. Beautiful scenery from the top of the Fort. The Dubrovnik Card includes visit to both sites.",
          "Although I've never watched Game of Thrones |(I have heard of it and know, roughly, what it is about) I marched up and around the fort (entry is free with your City Walls ticket but otherwise is 30 Kunas). There is not a lot to see and no remnants of Game of Thrones - I suppose",
          "Admission to the fort is 30 kuna but free with the city walls ticket. Worth climbing the steps for the views across to the old town. Not much there so take a drink. There are toilets. Allow about 1 hour to climb up and enjoy views.",
          "we went on a game of thrones tour which went in here. I've not seen the programme so didn't mean anything to me but the guide had photos of the scences and showed how they were shot in the Fort so this was interesting. Otherwise there isn't really anything in the fort. But great",
          "This was my favourite place to get the best overall views of Dubrovnik as you can see the walls around the city as well as the red roofs of the buildings inside. It's worth going to especially if you are going to the walls as it is included in the wall admission price. I suggest",
          "I wanted to visit this fort because I am a game of thrones fan, it was a steep climb up lots of stairs but totally worth it. we sat at the top for ages just watching people and boats pass by. great for photos!",
          "Situated on the outcrop across the bay from Pile gate entrance, Fort Lovrijenac is worth a visit, for the views alone. There are quite a few steps on the approach to the fort entrance, up a fairly steep incline. Your entrance fee is part of the city wall ticket, which costs 120",
          "As I was keen on watching the sunset from the city walls, I chose to visit Fort Lovrijenac first and the view from the windows were just ah-mazing! It is located outside the old city walls near the area where people go kayaking. Tip: If you choose to visit the Old City Walls",
          "Great view of the city and was our first stop before entering the city. Interesting place with very thick walls.",
          "Fort Lovrijenac lies on the outskirts of the Old Town Dubrovnik. It is easily seen from the road as you enter and leave Dubrovnik Old Town. It is also known as St Lawerence and often called Dubrovnik's Gilbraltar. Fort Lovrijenac is a cliff top fortress and theatre built 37 feet",
          "Great place to go especially for photos and views all around. Go with knowing some of the history for the full immersive experience.",
          "After a climb up the steep stony steps, you'll either have to pay for entry to the fort or present the ticket used to walk the old city walls of Dubrovnik; so worth hanging onto the ticket. Would recommend visiting the fort after leaving the old city, as it gives you a",
          "We loved this place! Its beautifully maintained, and the views are fantastic. Lots of stairs, but lovely views! The City Walls ticket allows you entry to this fort too - so we were able to combine the two.",
          "better value and views than walls, lots of stairs to get there but some lovely spots to look out at on the way up. brilliant",
          "The isolated Fort on its high premonitory can be viewed from a distance from the walk along the ancient city walls.",
          "We went here with The Game of Thrones Dubrovnik tour. Was great to find out about the history of the fort and how it has been used for Game of Thrones - although this we all heard from out tour guide. Without a tour guide I don't think we would have found out as much about the",
          "We'd already done the city walls and cable car experience, but still found value from visting on one of our last days in Dubrovnik. It provided another perspective of the stunning views we had come to love of the city. You walk up to the bottom of the fort and then pay (I",
          "This seems a must view for Game of Thrones fans but we haven't seen it. Not much information inside, but assume not much historical value. Free to get in with Dubrovnik card which is not well publicised. Did I mention lots of steps!",
          "We visited as part of a game of thrones tour. It's just so surreal to be there! And to actually see the amount of Computer effects they put into generating one episode of the show. Remember to show your wall tickets as entry is free.",
          "Visit with a Game of Thrones guide and he can show you all the rooms, areas and buildings used for the filming of the series. This fort is King's Landing with some CGI thrown in for good measure. I've also written a separate review on our Game of Thrones tour.",
          "It's fun to explore up and down the stone steps and there are great views. I recommend taking some history information because there is very little in the building to tell you about it.",
          "This fort is located just opposite to the old town and is worth a visit. You are getting a great view over the old city. The price is 30kona and the ticket can be used to cut the price for the city wall.",
          "The Game of Thrones location scouts must have been delighted to find this gem! It could not be more imposing and atmospheric! For the best experience, either go when it opens at 8am (as we did) and have the whole place to yourself, or go near closing time and watch the sunset.",
          "Great place to visit - included in the price of the city walls but not many people go there. You great great views of the city. Good at sunset due to sun angles. Apparently lots of Game of Thrones scenes filmed there if you are interested in that, although you might want to take",
          "The view from the fort to Dubrovnik Old Town is beautiful! Also, you will appreciate it, if you enjoy Game of Thrones. The walk itself is also picturesque, but mind to turn to the left right at the first opportunity when walking from Old Town side. The sign is on far wall, hard",
          "We had bought the one day Dubrovnik Card which included antrance to the walls and the fort (amongst other benefits). The card does not specifically mention the Fort but it is included. Not a huge amount to see internally but views are great and as we got in free (normally 30",
          "Lots of stairs to get to this attraction and if you buy a ticket for this one you get a discount to the Wall walk and visa versa, there is not much inside apart from more stairs it is well maintained and has toilet facilities. It is very popular with the game of thrones fans",

          "If you buy the ticket for walking the Old Town walls (do this first), you can then also do this Fort which is only a few minutes walk from the main gate into Old Town. Based on some of the walking tours that were going on when I was there, must have been a filming spot for Game",
          "Visited as part of our wall walk ticket and found the views even surpassed some of the views from the main city walls. Take you camera as the views are largely the only reason (but a great one) for a visit - unless you are a Game of Thrones fan (which I'm not!).",
          "A little way away from the old town walls but worth the walk - there is a more direct route but I think I got a bit lost! You get in with your walls ticket. Its the set for Kings Landing so is good for GoT fans. much quieter than the walls and old town, and great gardens around",
          "We visited the Fort during a Game of Thrones tour. There is a nice garden with benches, shade and a nice view on the ocean and the old town in front of it (which can be accessed without paying), but the view from inside the Fort is even better. Maybe it is best if you visit it",
          "There is no information inside; it's just the building and amazing views. We think it's part of the Game of Thrones tour, but that was us ease dropping! We sat there for a good hour watching the waves and the city. We loved it and recommend it! It's 30 kn without the pass,",
          "The place needs no description for GoT lovers ! Its a nice climb up to the top, but one gets to view the old town very nicely from here. Definitely worth spending a couple of hours around this place. The entrance is covered under the ticket that you purchase for the city walls",

The tickets are valid for three days, so it is possible to visit the walls one day and the fortress later in your visit. The views while walking up the steep stairs to get to the fortress are gorgeous too.",

          "Pile gate is one of the entrance gates to the old town, so gets incredibly crowded. Not an area you want to hang around for any length of time. It is however, a beautiful area of the old wall fortifications with lots of history. Recommend you do a walking tour of the old town,",

          "The Pile gate is beautiful, but the crowds ruin it. We found the stairs on th left before the bridge to be helpful in avoiding crowds. This gives you easy access to the beach for great pics. In this area, there is a small doorway to the left of the gate which will help you",

          "It's the most popular gate into the city, with a very busy tour bus \"station\" dropping heaps of tourists into the old town. It's another GoT location, so perhaps you have to do it. But maybe you should go at 9pm, when the day-trippers are back on board their cruise ships !",

          "The Pile Gate is the main entrance to one of the most lovely cities in Croatia. The limestone cobblestone streets are a thing of beauty. The history within the walls are there for the learning. You either read about it and find the sights on your own or take a tour with well",
          "there is no need to loos to many words on Dubrovnik. Take away the few contemporary details and you dive back in to the past. The whole city is like a time machine. Pila gate is the entrance to the past with orange trees growing in the park under it. If you come in late April",

          "Although its size is somewhat impressive and it does cross a bridge (over what is now an orange tree park, no longer water)... there is nothing really breathtaking about this gate. It gets rather busy as well, due to the fact it has a ramp to get from the street to Stradun",
          "The most busy entry to the city as right next to the location where most buses stop. As soon as you go through these gates the entry to walk the top of the walls is on the left and easy to miss. Very slippery pavers when wet so be careful.",

          "The gate itself is an interesting piece of architecture but may not be able to hold your attention. There are streams of people coming and going because the gate serves as the entrance to the Old Town of Dubrovnik. If you have the time to linger, do it, but if not, just know",
          "As the main entry gate to the old city, this area wows you with your first viewing. Walking through it feels very historical, both for its actual history and for the fact it is used in scenes from Game of Thrones filming. Wonderful ambience and terrific photos opportunities but",

          "It is really exciting seeing this gate for the first time and wondering what lays hidden on the other side. It is like entering a fairytale with the drawbridge, arched gate and the walls of the city. You have to be early though if you want a good view. It is almost constantly",
          "We stayed only 5 mins away so went through this gate so many times. Do make sure you stop and look up as you are \u2018 funnelled \u2018 through the gate, it is worth being pushed for. It is always very busy whatever the time of year so I am told by a local. Just inside the city there is",
          "Try to get here at a time when not so busy. It has a good system for getting people in and out of the city but still gets very busy. It gets you into the old town and only pedestrians unless you pay a GREAT deal of money!!",
          "Passed through the gate on the way in and back out. Well preserved old buildings with some details of the associated history. Very busy and pedestrian one way lanes in use worked well at the pinch points. The usual street musicians, guitarist, were there.",
          "This gate is really quite beautiful but I wish they would keep it up more. To me, it looked like it needed a good power washing. There are a lot of tourists who will pile up at Pile Gate but you can still get beautiful views of not only the gate but of the harbor as well.",
          "The gate was constructed on the western wall in 1537 to provide secure entry to the walled city. Today it is subject to the daily onslaught of thousands as it is the main entry into Dubrovnik and the starting point of every tour of the old city.",
          "We had a guide take us through here and explain the history here and the wall and the Stradum. The wars and the people who still live inside the walls which is only about A thousand families.",
          "The gate is the main entry to the old town of Dubrovnik and leads directly to the main street. It is one of the most beautiful gates we have seen, with a wooden drawbridge. The place is crowded with tourists which makes photography a challenge.",
          "Does what it says on the tin. It is a gate. Historical features above it but you\u2019d need to go on a tour to find out more about those. Ultimately it gets you into the old town.",
          "This is the main entrance to the Old City. If you are arriving by taxi this is likely where they will take you (if not ask to be taken to the Pile Gate entrance. The gate itself is beautiful. If you want beautiful views of the fort (and a scene from Game of Thrones),",
          "The Old City and thus, Pile Gate, is a very beautiful place, but because of the cruise ship people, it's overcrowded and crazy. Huge cruise ships dump off thousands of people in the Old City every day, so much that it decreases the experience for other travelers. It's hard to",
          "Wow. It's not often you get to walk through a gate dating back to 1537, that has a drawbridge. It leads to the Stradun, the main promenade in the old town.",
          "The Pile Gate is a beautiful way to enter Dubrovnik's Old Town. There is a nice drawbridge to cross right before going through the gate.",
          "There is a bridge that was lifted up to secure the old town in the old days. The chain ropes are still there, and from the inside we saw the hand operated mechanism to lift the bridge. It is a fairytale",
          "With three entrances into the city and this being the main one, it does get busy during peak months, especially with lots of people milling around outside. Just like the rest of the city there is a sense of its history at this small gate, you can imagine guards standing there",
          "Summer time it's super busy , can't even walk . So we went there end of October and much better and quieter . Great location, from pile gate u can take a taxi anywhere and also buses to airport or lapad or Babin Kuk- Dubrovnik Areas . Very interesting thing is - taxis are",
          "The Pile Gate is an impressive way to enter the walled city. One wonders how did they manage to construct something so massive without modern equipment.",
          "THis is one of 3 entrances to the walled city. As usual it can be packed so they have added a rope for exiting and entering visitors just to control the flow. I can imagine this to be a majestic structure and fortress back in the days.",
          "We entered the city of Dubrovnik through this gate and it created a great first impression. It provided a strong fortified gate and immediately inside is the staircase entrance to the walls. In the afternoon it gets very crowded.",
          "Pile gate is a major meeting point for most tours and can become very congested with many coaches dropping off/picking up, taxis and buses also run from here Even though I was slightly out of season it was very packed during the day but in the evening it\u2019s a much less congested",
          "This is the entrance that brings you back in time. Busy crowds now, I'm sure busy crowds in the past. Be sure to glance around to see the original gate mechanism.",
          "The entrance to the Old City of Dubrovnik offers a beautiful piece of historical and authentic architecture. The walkways are not intimidatingly busy either, however we visited in October and it could be feared that this would be heaving during the summer!",
          "A beautiful entry into the old town, can get very busy with the cruise ship passengers and tourists busing in. Most walking tour start from near the gate also. A must see.",
          "This is one of the better ways to enter the Old Town Area without the Tourist buses pouring in but sits at the top level of stairs in the city! Remember you are going down and if you have problems with stairs may think about the Main entrance or plan on exiting the main",
          "Whether you like it or not you will find yourself walking through here at some point during a visit to Dubrovnik. It is either an entrance to the wonders inside or an escape route from the mass tourism inside. It does however demonstrate the massive construction work that built",
          "The center of old town and the main entrance to old town Dubrovnik. A reconstructed beautiful complex of churches, fortifications and byways",
          "As others point out, this is the place where coach trips and cruise ships disgorge their passengers and local buses and taxis drop off and pick up so the city fathers have implemented a keep right system to separate the coming and going crowds. At times the line moves at a",
          "If you are walking into the old town you will walk through the pile Gate, it will provide you with a taste of what to expect once you enter",
          "Pile Gate is where our shuttle dropped us off from the airport. It serve as a great entrance to a stunning Game of Thrones adventure.",
          "It's the main entrance into the Old Town and is simply stunning! It's a one way system in and out as it is very busy around there it would be chaos without this!",
          "On approaching this gate you can tell that you are approaching something pretty magnificent and on entering the old town you won\u2019t be disappointed. Impressive medieval architecture.",
          "A nice area to walk around, get an ice cream or some snacks. Revealings a nice area of Dubrovnik and other souvenir and restaurants etc.",
          "Because most people arrive by bus, this is a very busy place, even needing `keep right ` signs! However, it is convenient, with ramped access and then flat going onto Stradun unlike Buza, the North entrance where you must decend innumerable steep stone steps.",
          "Very busy area. Entrance & bridge is where local bus terminates. Take stunning photos from bridge, before entering old town. Stunning.",
          "Great views at this gate of Old Town walls. Really lovely scenes. Can get taxis from here also and is a shorter way out of Old Town than other gate.",
          "This is the main entrance to the old town. It wasn't busy when we were there so it was pleasant to be there. Tour groups are dropped off here including cruise ship passengers. Very nice setting.",
          "This thank god was a quiet time to visit Debrovnik..... It was still full of ignorant tourists who barge past, into and knock you out the way to get the photos they want. American and Chinese cruise ships had docked and the mass disembarking was astonishing. The city resembled a",
          "This is the most popular entrance into Dubrovnik old town as the local buses stop right outside and the cruise liner passengers get dropped there also. The entrance is relatively small and can be a bottle neck with the visiting crowds. It can get EXTREMELY congested. Avoid",
          "Gateway to the old town, can get quite crowded, but impressive entrance way. One of the entrances to the walls is just on the left as you enter through the gate.",
          "This is the main entrance into the city and the one used by 1000s of people of the cruise ships so not that pleasant ! Ok if you are here early or late but it\u2019s nothing special just a hole in the walk!",
          "This is the main entrance that people use to get into old town. It also is a meeting place for tours both of old town and of other places. Because of the crowds is why it is 3 stars",
          "It\u2019s a gate that you walk through to get into the old town from the west side. There\u2019s a statue of St Blaise above it, who watches over the town. It\u2019s also got a draw bridge which is actually pretty cool and I wonder if it works. Right behind the gate on the inside there\u2019s a",
          "The road leading to it and having those brick houses before it left and the adriatic blue to the right is such a great presentation to the charming city which lies after this beautiful Gate! Must be visited day and night and watch the Guards!",
          "OK there are large groups but you have to start somewhere and immediately you have architecture and the historic feel. Do not miss the smallest back lanes you can find. The walls are only an option for the fittest. Compact and cute says it all. I don\u2019t think you need pay for a",
          "It is just a gate though an impressive one but it means that the crowds are funnelled through it and it means the squares inside and outside are congested. Just inside is a fine Monastery and also one of the accesses to the city walls so the congestion gets worse.",
          "This is the main entrance gate into the Fortified Old Town of Dubrovnik.Originally built in the 15th century it had a wooden drawbridge leading to the gate that would be heaved up at night for security reasons.The Wooden draw bridge was later replaced by a stone bridge built",
          "Old town, city center or The dubrovnik walls better known as kingslanding. Its a long walk, alot of steps, museum etc don't go in the afternoon better in the evening. Best thing what I liked there are water fountains everywhere and everyone can drink water, u don't have to pay",
          "The main land entrance into the City so always packed as it seems to be the place where coaches off load their passengers and tour guides meet their groups. It is pretty spectacular though and always packed out! In fact they now seem to have a pedestrian one way system in place.",
          "This is a fantastic walk with amazing views of Dubrovnik but if you intend on doing it during the summer be there right on opening around 8.30am as the crowds are incredible and also can be very hot. You can buy the ticket just inside the gate and on the way around there are",
          "This is the Main Entrance to the Old Town, though there are 2 more gates, this is the most used. Entrance could have been bigger due to the volume of tourists coming in the Walls! Best is to stay 2 nights & go to inside the Walls when the Cruise Ships go!!! Mind you,",
          "If you're going to Old Town, you can't help but see this impressive main entrance. There are both stairs and ramps to get down into the main Stradun. Be sure to stop and look at the exhibit about the war damage in Dubrovnik. Amazing what has been done to keep this old city",
          "This is the main gate into the city and shopping streets. As you can imagine, it is busy with people constantly.",
          "Pile gate is one of the few reasons to venture over to the North-West of the walls (the other main interest being St. Lawrence Fortress). Unfortunately pile gate is bursting at the seams with tourists as this is the main gateway used to enter and exit the walled city. It\u2019s",
          "Lots of tourists....but then again you are one of them. This is the main entrance to the walled city. There are a lot of people selling souvenirs, once you get through this main entrance it thins out a bit so that it is OK.",
          "This gate is one of the most photographed parts of Dubrovnik Old Town and entrances to the Harbour - lots of nice restaurants and bars surround it.",
          "Main entry point for cruisers, buses, etc. Very scenic area just outside of the gate. Very crowded for shoulder season in September and during our several visits, there seemed to be a constant smell of sewer gas or stagnant water when you cross the gate and the moat bridge.",
          "One of Dubrovnik Old Town\u2019s main attractions and maybe the busiest main gate entry point. Recommend.",
          "During your visit to Dubrovnik I am sure this is a location that can't be missed. You will definitely walk through the gates a couple of times. It is really beautiful. And of course... another Game of Thrones location. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Excellent architecture, you must keep to the right when entering and leaving because of crowds ..but there's always one muppet",
          "Walking through the Pile gate is feeling like going back 1000 years ago. Admire the gate and the old City. Do not miss it!",
          "As gates go I couldn't fault it, it was a way in and a way out of the old town so did everything you would expect. Did have a chap who was playing guitar all day on one occasion and did wonder if he would have any fingers left by the end of the day! I believe in the main season",
          "This main entrance is one of the points that explain the weel fortification if the city. After the main gates, you have a small hall where the enemies would remain trapped surrounded by archers. Nice defense strategy.",
          "This is the western gate, and is by far the most used of the two entrances into the Old City. Just outside of this gate are where most city buses stop. Chances are you will arrive here when visiting the Old City. Just inside the gates is the massive fountain and a nice square",
          "The gate is one of the entrances into the Old City. It forms part of the Old City Walls that encircle to Old City. Well preserved and maintained. It can be a bit congested to enter on busy days, but they have done a good job in placing a rope to keep pedestrian traffic separated",
          "This massive gate with its drawbridge and solid stone structure was the most important entrance to the city. Today the drawbridge has been replaced by a stone bridge, but the feel of a massive citadel is there. Just at the top of the entrance is a statue of the patron saint of",
          "This is the main entrance into the old town and thus very busy. They have a one way system in place which works really well. Try to avoid getting here between 10 -2pm as it is madness in the season.",
          "The must see entrance to use when visiting old town Dubrovnik ..with its impressive draw a bridge...they've made a simple in and out procedure for busy times which makes sense.. great photo opportunity at Pile Gate",
          "This is a pretty cool place to go and take some pictures. I would go here and snap a few pics. It\u2019s by the water",
          "Given the volume of feet this is organised with and in and out system that allows access both via straits and a ramp. The gate itself is impressive as a piece of defence works, with a moated area - now a children\u2019s play area and a planted garden. Spectacular view as you enter",
          "Arrived here on our first day, some nice restaurants however super super busy more of a meeting point for cruise stoppers!",
          "This is where it all starts when you visit the old city of Dubrovnik. The gates are quite impressive and when you walk over them you can see where the old moat was. You should also go out the east gate as it has less people but also worth seeing.",
          "Great to see but there are big crowds go early but worth visit. You can pass through the gate or as we did go round to the left on the walk way and entry from the side gates a better way to get entry.",
          "The medieval gated entrance to the Old Town is usually very busy and can be quite crowded but when we visited after being up at the Fort Lovrijenac it was quiet and we managed to get some nice pics of the statue of St Blaise above the entrance.",
          "This is the main gate inland for dropping off and picking up so it gets very busy! It is gorgeous though and easy enough to get through (it has a ramp and steps). There is a lovely gelato place right outside it!",
          "One of several entrances to old Dubrovnik. Since there were so many people both during the day and at night these was a dividing rope at the entrance to facilitate the flow of people into and out of the old city.",
          "Stunning architecture from history, they've got a little rope fence separating pedestrian traffic coming in and out. Doesn't stop people ignoring it, or just stopping dead in front of you to take a picture of the gate though.",
          "It's worth stopping for a moment and ignoring the hustle, this is beautiful - nicely preserved. Stop for a moment then move onward into the city!",
          "A magnificent entrance to a wonderfully historic town - such deep history the moment you step inside with the vast walls overlooking and the marbled floor of the Stradum - this place has it all including Game of Thrones - well worth a visit",
          "This is the main entrance to the old city of Dubrovnik, most of the busses stop and drop people here. It is impressive with a drawbridge and beautiful stone stairs (used im the filming if Game of Thrones) that lead the way into the old city.",
          "Lovely- a beautiful entrance to the old city. You\u2019ve only got a choice of a few gates to enter and this is one of them.",
          "One of the two old entrances to the city. Cross the old drawbridge and imagine yourself travelling back in time and you can feel the heritage. There are steps and a ramp down into the old city, which is completely traffic free. Be aware that due to cruise liners visiting that",
          "Very busy in August but since our last visit they have split the visitors into two lanes - one in and one out which has lessened the congestion considerably.",
          "The main way into the old city of Dubrovnik. The entrance is imposing but it gets much too crowded at times. Try to avoid times when cruise ship crowds are trying to go though all at once When you go through take the time to appreciate the war damage map which explains why",
          "Another game of thrones locations. Great place and some nice shops. Taxis pick and drop off for a good starting point to Dubrovnik old town.",
          "An easy meeting place for separated friends. The statue above the entrance started us on a \"find-the-short-statues \" quest throughout the old town. It's a grand entrance to one of the best \"old towns\" in Europe.",
          "A beautiful entrance and would be a perfect spot for a photo however it was just too busy. Although busy, it was Very well organised with an entrance and exit line.",
          "We entered from this Gate in the old city, with our kids. Next to the gate to the right, inside the old town you can buy the ticket to climb the walls. Go early to avoid crowds.",
          "If you enter the old town here you are right by the spot where you can pay to walk the city walls, have a great view down the street ahead towards the harbour entrance and are surrounded by shops and cafes. There are other ways in but this is the one with the most character.",
          "Very historic town. Make sure and explore all the levels and side alleys which are full of eating places, gift shops, craft shops and bars including Irish pubs. Avoid on a Thursday in particular if you hate crowds as Cruise ships always dock on a Thursday.",
          "Main entrance to the old town and we used it everyday for 12 days. It is a busy entrance but has an entrance and exit lane that people keep to so very organised. Two soldiers (costume) march through the Main Street in the evening at 7pm to stand at the Pile gate until 9pm",
          "If you\u2019re looking for a romantic backdrop overlooking the harbour this should be your go to place! Pile Gate is located on the Eastern side of Old Town just a few minutes walk from the bustling centre.",

          "When we arrived via bus, we stopped just outside of Pile gate, very convenient entrance to Old Town. This is the entrance to Old Town as well as a place to purchase a city pass for museums and wall walk.",
          "A gate. Which is old. That's it. Okay, it forms an entrance to the Old City and Game of Thrones was filmed here, but nothing much to see. Be sure to visit if you like pigeons. And crowds. But make sure you catch the changing of the guards, which is worth seeing.",
          "Pile gate is the main entrance to Dubrovnik old town on the west side. It is easy to find, as many city and tour buses stop just outside this gate at the Tourist Information Center (public toilets 1\u20ac). Crossing the 15 century stone bridge over the former moat, the imposing",
          "The entrance to the Old City is beautiful. It is not a movie set but REAL which makes it all the more amazing. It can be crowded so time your visit accordingly.",
          "One star goes to the city of Dubrovnik for their greedy merchants robbing tourists with irrational prices, for their low services, for the trash and neglected environment and for not accepting cards helping the black business. We went home with huge disappointment.",
          "What a grand entrance to the city or even leaving the city. It was so fascinating to hear about the filming of Game of Thrones and to once again see where it was filmed",
          "This is where you enter into the Dubrovnik old city. There are typically lots of tourists, unless you get there early or late in the day.",
          "We went to the Pile Gate to get our Dubrovnik Card. The gate almost looks like the fortress for the city walls. When you exit you get to the exterior of the walls and see Tourist Center and the entrance to the Fort Lovrijenac.",
          "Pile gate is main entrance to the old town of Dubrovnik. Sometimes it can get crowded as lots of people are going in and out. The entrance it self is beautiful and marvellous!",

          "This is the main point for coaches and taxis, kayaking tours also go from the small beach below, so throngs of people here. The gate itself is lovely and would be part of a visit to Dubrovnik.",
          "Impressive to walk through. Sometimes they have people stood either side I'm costume. The view of the seafront is beautiful from there too.",

          "Beautiful city, so historic, so clean, just amazing, great atmosphere, so much to see, so much to do, so many places to eat, fresh sea food everywhere. Places here look perfect to have a dream wedding",
          "We found this gate to be the easiest entrance into the old city. You can either take the stairs or there is a ramp which helps if you have suitcases. There is a taxi stand very nearby.",
          "In quiet time this is most likely a lovely place but the amount of coaches and taxi's makes this a impossible place to view in detail...very nice architecture though.",
          "Pile gate is one of the three entrances to the old town and by far the busiest due to a lot of tourbusses dropping their guests here. However, there is a clear path made for foottraffic, helping to guide the streams of people. So overall, the gate is very pretty and doable to",
          "Part of the fantastic Old city experience. Some may say \u2018It\u2019s Just a gate\u2019 But I would reply \u2018 But It\u2019s a great gate!! Xx",
          "The entrance to the Old Town is very busy at all times of the day, in the evening there are guards that hold the draw bridge open, it is pretty to see but can cause cues as people still want pictures taking. Best to visit early to avoid cues",
          "The big walls to the city of old town. Can be cramped walking through in the middle of the day but good traffic directing to help. We got a taxi from the ferry terminal to pile gate which cost us 90k.",
          "Went as part of the Dubrovnik Musical Festival to see Croatian song and dance. The festival runs for July each year. Great company, Luna, most enjoyable.",
          "Stunning place altogether. City is family orientated. Plenty of free fresh water to drink. Helpful frendly people",
          "But has lots of history behind it and its the main gate to old city. Nothing spectacular except the tourist ambiance",
          "We first visited the gate 9 years ago before this gate became a location where they have a queue setup due to all of the people coming and going. You are going to enter here since this is where all of the buses and taxis will drop you off, but at this point it is just usually a",
          "The entrance to the walled town of Dubrovnik - it also has the changing of the guards in the evenings which is nice to watch - a little bar just inside the entrance to sit and people watch and watch the harbour too. Unsure why this really has its' own review site...... part of",
          "Essentially this is just the entrance to old town Dubrovnik so not sure why it has it's own review platform! It is however, famously in scenes of game of thrones so worth seeing if that is what you like. Other than that, is always busy with people going in and out.",
          "Dubrovnik is overprized! Almost all activities begin at pile gate. Dont buy anything there. Everything is so expensive. We planned to eat a Fish there but we went without. The menue was more expensive than in SWITZERLAND! Good place to meet for activities but not more. Don\u2018t buy",
          "The Pile Gate is the main gateway to the entrance of the Old City in Dubrovnik, It is well-known and appeared a few times in the Games of Thrones tv series. Definitely a place to take a photo or two. It was less crowded when we were there in winter.",
          "This is a gate. It used to have a drawbridge. It used to have water running beneath it. It used to lock up at 8pm. It used to defend the city. It used to have archers and cannons. Now it is a big, queuing, stand on one side only, door.",
          "Entrance to the Old Town through this gate. Has a drawbridge - takes you back through the years. Entry into a area then on into the Old Town. There is a lady here that sells handmade Croatian embroidery items. She is dressed in traditional clothing - you can\u2019t miss her.",

          "Probably recognisable to Game of Thrones fans as it is in several scenes from the series. Can be crowded to take pictures as this is the main entrance to the Old Town from the bus and taxi area. There is a ATM just outside the gate that doesn't charge for withdrawals (quite a",

          "Went through the Pile Gate to gain access to the Old Town. Wonderful. Very busy though, lots of other tourists like myself trying to get in and also out. One Way system in operation whilst I was there which made it a bit easier to get around. Quite an impressive building.",

          "If you\u2019re visiting the old town, it\u2019s impossible not to see this, it\u2019s super impressive and like the rest of the old town, very beautiful and grand, stunning limestone and as soon as you\u2019re inside, greeted by live music and a vibe of medieval times. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "This was an efficient gate that looked very old and transported me in and out. There was nothing special about it.",

          "We walked to Pile Gate, which was pointed out, with the assistance of a tour guide who gave us a tour around Dubrovnik. However, after being given an opportunity to explore the town, it was clear that such guidance really wasn't necessary, as the town is small and you can",
          "Very busy in this area but very historic and atmospheric. As Game of Thrones fans it was exciting to be at the city gate. Very beautiful area of the Old City. This city should be on everyone\u2019s bucket list!",

          "There is a divider separating the two directions, and between 11am-6pm it can get very crowded (at least in summer months). It's basically a gate that everyone has to pass though to enter the city. A nice gate but not spectacular. If you want to stop to appreciate it go during",
          "This has now become the main gate through which people enter the city. It is impressive, and very close to this gate, just inside is one of the ways on to the walls. Much of the original structure remains which makes it feel as though you are really stepping back in time when",

          "Undoubtedly an impressive way to enter the old town. From the gate you get a good idea of the scale of the walls. Very busy though as this seems to be the main tourist entry point as well as the local bus station. It is an entry point to walk the walls.",
          "The Old Town is a beautiful place to visit but gets very busy. A must see with lots of restaurants but if walking the walls don't go in full sun.",
          "Great spot for pictures of tourists --took a wonderful picture of a nun talking with a tourist and a street vendor dressed in Croatian outfit. Inside a fellow was selling gold hearts for 1 euro for happiness. They had 2018 Dubrovnik on them. Purchased several on white ribbon.",

          "This was the very impressive entrance to an awesome old city. This place was one of the most beautiful sites I have ever seen. And I have travelled extensively. You must do the 2k walk around the walls. The city and water views are worth the effort. Be aware that there are quite",

          "This gate dates to the 15th Century and is an impressive big structure. It protected the citizens of the city from their enemies. Approaching the Pile (pronounced \"Peely\") gate,you walk along a stone bridge which could have stood above a moat below. Today this gate allows entry",

          "Beautiful entryway into the old city, Franciscan Monastery and Apothecary immediately inside, small square where street entertainers often perform. Leads to the many delights within the Old City.",

          "Pile Gate comprises both an inner and outer gate dating from 1460 and 1537 respectively. the outer gate has a statue of St Blaise, the city\u2019s patron saint, set in a niche over the arch. The structure of the old bridge leading to the gate still stands but you now walk a paved",

          "The Pile Gate can hardly be avoided if you are visiting Dubrovnik. It is important as the terminus for several bus routes - catch the number 6 if you want to visit ordinary shops and supermarkets in shopping centres outside the Old Town, or perhaps the public beaches on Babin",
          "Very busy area expect Disney type crowds food and beverages are more expensive within the wall. Give yourself plenty of time and there are many places of interest we found going with a guided tour was best if able walk the outer wall views views are spectacular",
          "Really beautiful entrance to the city but the entryway is narrow and can get overwhelming with so many people coming through.",

          "Simple gate but you can find small stalls in at the side before the gate selling antiques or local produce such as honey, lavender etc.",
          "Great photo opportunities here at the gate . Food And drinks expensive tho . The entry to the city walls is just inside the gate and there is a nice fountain.",
          "This is just another entrance into the old town which takes you in at the top part so you come down some very nice narrow streets which are full of apartments shops and places to eat.The higher up nearer to the walls is the area where people live and stay on holiday.",
          "This is a very impressive city gate, though overwhelmed with tourists. Local buses drop off nearby (though the bus service cannot really cope with demand), as do taxis and tour buses so the area is always heaving, even to the extent of having a one-way pedestrian route in part.",
          "The whole of old town Dubrovnik is a stunning place. If you are out and about and see this gate, make sure to go through it and see what is one of the best old towns in the world. If you arrive by bus it's more than likely that you will enter the old town through this gate",
          "This is the scene of the riot in season 2 of Game of Thrones plus some other scenes. It's the main entrance at leads to a little playpark which is great for kids and eating a packed lunch. Very Iconic and a very central point. You must get Ice Cream whilst sitting outside.",
          "I started at the Dubrovnik Main Bus Station. I recieved directions, to get to the Pile Gate, via bus #6. It took less than 15 minutes to reach from there. Once getting to the main entrance, i couldn't help but to take my camera out, and start snapping pictures. How amazing!",
          "This is the best way in and out of the old city, but it can be very crowded. Tour buses drop people off near here and there is also a regular bus stop.",
          "This is hard to miss as this is the gate closest to where buses drop you. Also it is the gate Jaime Lannister went through first time he came back to Kings Landing with just one hand :-)",
          "One has to enter the old city through various ways and thus has got to be the most spectacular . Steeped in history regarding the old city it is awesome.",
          "Ancient gate to old city of Dubrovnik serves as easy access point both to Main Street as well as the wall tour which begins just inside",
          "This is the main entrance for the old town and we were lucky that was 2 people dressed up like guards where people could take nice photos on the entrance, so far all good until you get in and get really rude workers that are refurbishing buildings inside.",
          "Located close to the main bus stop area, the PIle Gate is a formidable looking entrance to the old town, but is dwarfed by the city walls. Before you go in, savour the sight and scents of the orange trees and oleanders which are clustered by the bridge which leads to the gate.",
          "This is the busiest of the three entrances and is quite striking. Look out for the gargoyle on the right as you enter.",
          "Lots of coaches drop their passengers here but be patient and you\u2019ll get through. Try going later in the day.",
          "During the day, this seems to be where all the cruise ship passengers come through. The architecture is very cool. At 21:00 there is the old city guards here watching out for the city. A must see once to the old town.",
          "It can become very busy here especially when cruise ships are in! Lots if yours begin and end here! Fantastic though",
          "Georgeos columns and balcony, it has stairs and a ramp, so ycan go in with lugage. It takes you directly to main street Stradun,",
          "Nicest way to get into the old town. Impressive and a great point to receive the first impression of this beautiful town. I do not like the map of propaganda where they show where the shells of the enemy fell during the Homeland. In Mostar they could put a map of their own",
          "As you approach this main entrance to Old Town you have a great sense of history. You cross the deep moat, over a bridge [no water in it now] to go in, as many people in the past must have done - impressed by the fortifications. There is a sloping access as well as stairs, so",
          "What is hard is imagining what this gate was like when it was built, the history. Try and imurse yourself and stop and think for a moment as you pass through.",
          "The Pile gate is the main entrance to the old town, and as such, it gets crazy busy. Take deep breaths, practice your patience, and enjoy it. Even better, if you're staying in Old Town, get up early and come to the gate around 7am when you can really enjoy it without all the",

          "A visit to the Dubrovniks Castle, and the old town is an incredible experience. The sightseeing is amazing. I highly recommend.",
          "This is the main gate into the old town. There are steps but also wheelchair accessible route. Very well preserved. One can also walk in from the moat underneath the drawbridge.",
          "When with my four year old daughter. Good photo op beside the harbour, and also looking down towards the old town. Very busy on both occasions that we were there.",
          "Impressive but chaotic. On one day 3 cruise ships were in port and the queues outside the gate were causing chaos. We used our common sense and walked round the outside and entered at the quiet side entrance near the cable car.",
          "This is the main entrance to town. Quite imposing. So busy there is a one way entry and exit in force. A very good idea. Have a good look at the splendid stonework and there should be a minstrel playing an instrument there. Good access by a ramp, but you can choose stairs if you",
          "out apartment was only a minutes walk away from the gate, it was lovely, great for taking photos of.",
          "The elevation was great. However, when the cruise ships are in, it is a disaster like trying to move a herd of cattle. There are steps and a ramp for those who cannot negotiate the steps",
          "The historic gate is a good starting point for exploring the Old Town or the city walls. I recommend going after 4pm, before that the cruise ship tourists literally swarm the place. The atmosphere is very different in the evening. Calmer!",
          "Going through the Pile Gate feels like when you enter a castle (it is after all a drawbridge) except this time it your portal to the old city. Feels a bit like time travel, especially in the evening when all the pesky cruise ship groups have left for the day.",
          "Wonderfully historic Pile Gate is rather interesting and lovely to look at as well as being the key to the ancient old town. There are spectacular views of the water as well when you look out before you go through the gate",
          "The gateway to the old town. Nice spot for some picture - for the rest of it, just somewhere you walk through.",
          "What can one say about a gate? It's the most commonly used entrance to the old city of Dubrovnik. Lots of tourists and terrible parking. Great restaurants nearby. Pile gate is also the mostly used startingpoint of the tour on the walls.",
          "Another excellent Croatian photo opportunity. A nice hustle and bustle around the place and lots of little ice cream stalls and bars and restaurants. The locals are very informative and travel is easy and cheap to get to and from.",
          "This was a location for kings landing in game of thrones. Definitely recommend this beautiful spot in the old town. Also holds a lot of history of the town",
          "The history of this location is unbelievable. Then the structure of the walls and buildings follows. I only wish I could have been there with a few less people. It was a very busy spot.",
          "The gate is just that, a gateway. Nothing to see here really. The crush is huge, especially when the cruise boat crowds arrive. Come early or not at all.",
          "It's so beautiful and so lovely to walk through and instantly be in the old town. The only problem is slow moving tourists sometimes make it difficult to get through as they stop and take photos every 5 seconds haha",
          "We were staying in Old Town so this was the best way for us to get to our accomodation with our luggage. Unfortunately it is a bit of a nightmare even in the shoulder season. So many people trying to get in an out, people stopping to take photos, street sellers and slow walking",
          "Even at this time of year this is a very busy place but it is truly the ancient centre of Dubrovnik.",
          "This entrance to OLD DOWN is seen many times in the TV series Game of Thrones. It is very neat to walk thru this entrance and take pictures! It seems to be a favorite spot for picture taking!",
          "Pile Gate is one of the main gates to the old part of the city of Dubrovnik. It is part of the wall that surrounds the old town. This gate is also one of the main gates they show in the HBO show Game of Thrones.",
          "It a good as a landmark, meeting spot but nothing much to see considering the crowds consistenly passing through. If you want to visit Dubrovnik, avoid the months of july and august, you can barely walk without bumping into someone.",
          "Main entrance for bus loads of tourists. No striking views. Use entrance in the old harbour side and you will be in for a treat",
          "Somewhere between a grand entrance and an Escher painting the Pile Gate is one of a kind. It's next to the main bus stops in the Dubrovnik and there is a left luggage place close by at the TIC in the city (first shop on the right of the main street after the fountain).",
          "One of two main entrances into the city. Well maintained and worth a look whilst getting into the old town",
          "This is a really impressive gate and sets the scene of what to expect in Dubrovnik. The 'old town' is such a well preserved, amazing place and the gate serves as a fantastic introduction to this.",
          "One of the best maintained UNESCO site despite the war and earthquake that this site has gone through. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Croatia to visit the old city",
          "When we walked through the Pile Gate if was a cool feeling to know how old it is. You have to take a few minutes to look around and see all the details that are there such as the statue of St. Blaise. What a great entrance to the Old Town.",
          "Impressive gate in excellent condition as you enter the walls. A must see when in \u2018old town\u2019 to be appreciated by all visitors.",
          "Many city gates are just that, the gate, but this one is very interesting in the design, there is information about the town inside the gate areas and even some vendors set up in there. Pretty entrance to a really neat town.",
          "It's a bus terminus, the first point of contact with the Old Town. Tourists from all over Dubrovnik congregate here, from ocean liners to backpackers, all jostling for a \"good spot\" to rest and breathe, A narrow stone bridge funneling the throngs through an even smaller gate and",
          "One of three entrances to the city. This time of year, there is no crowds or queues to cross the bridge. plenty of time to take piccies and enjoy the surrounds. once inside the outer gate, there is a sneaky opening/doorway, to the beach. There is no way we would want to be here",
          "This is where you start to think about the experience that you are about to have. I love that you have to go through this important gate, and the crowds merge at this point. It reminded me of the entrance into the palace in Bangkok. Some people dislike that, crowds and all. I",
          "The pile gate is beautiful, but it will be amassed with tourists from cruise ships. On peak summer days there is a queue for the shuttle buses to disembark close to this gate. The gate and the surrounding area has some great shops and views.",
          "When you walk through this gate you enter a world of the past. It is all right in front of you just beckoning you to walk down the streets and soak it all in. A wonderful experience that you will remember forever.",
          "Beautiful architecture and a lovely place. Entered the old town walls from here! Had a nice time! Must visit",
          "Pile Gate is the main entrance to Old Town and is the best way to start exploring Dubrovnik. It gets crowded in the day and evening. After you go through the arch, you can walk down stairs or use the ramp. There are artists and musicians there most of the time. You'll also",
          "great to see this historic place but how long can you look at it for ? a must see though. this is game of thrones area. bars and restaurants close by.",
          "Pile Gate is one of the main entrances to Old Town Dubrovnik with a bridge and a draw bridge. Beautiful landscape on both sides of the bridge. Beautiful entrance through the wall with stairs down to the city. Easy bus access to this gate.",
          "You can get print out of cruise ships and expected passengers so you can plan a less crowded entry to the old town. Avoid Friday and Saturday",
          "The Pile Gate is a well known meeting point for tourists and tour groups. As such it can get rather hectic with a variety of unmarked buses and equally poorly identifiable tour leaders attempting to find particular people. It is also the entry/exit to the old city, near the",
          "Take a walk through the unbelievable walls. Walk across the drawbridge. Kids will love it! It's quick but inside the walls you have old town to wander and outside you have a lovely harbor area with great sea views and a few restaurants. If at all possible go early in day",
          "One of the 2 main gates to the old city and on the walls. You can access the walls here but we did on the opposite side of the city. Immaculately preserved as is everything here.",
          "Bustling and busy, the area is traditionally Croatian, but invaded by tour touts. You have no choice but to go through the area to reach the old town.",
          "The Pile Gate is a good start into the old city. A lot of tourist traffic but it is near to the bus station so it is easy to come to old city and start your sightseeing.",
          "you really get the old city charm feel while in the old city and the Pile gate is the entrance to the walls of dubrovnik",
          "This is not a destination in itself, rather it is one of several entrances into the old town section of Dubrovnik. One of the access points to walk the wall is also very nearby. There are artists, Boat Trip vendors, and stalls selling handicrafts and t-shirts just inside Pile",
          "Amazing scenery It is a busy location but well worth it, The riot scene from Game of Thrones was filmed here",
          "A main entrance to the old city, this entrance sometimes has guards at the front which may increase its grandeur. On the day I visited, not so much. You can find shade there. It is cool looking. A great meeting place that is easily found.",
          "Helps to have a guide so that one gains an understanding of what there is to do and explains the challenges one faces if you choose to climb all the stairs. It helps to know your options regarding doing \"part of the wall\" or the entire circuit.",
          "A busy place leading to a fantastic town. Loads to see and do. Striking views over the harbour and amazing walls ringing over our heads.",
          "What lovely entrance, and is one of the main entrances to the Old Town. As with the old town it is very busy but leads to Brsalje Street. Apparently, and I've never watch this programme, Game of Thrones, has filmed just inside the Gate and was one of many locations used in the",
          "This is not really an attraction in itself, it's just the entrance to the old town. It is an impressive entrance and you walk over a draw bridge and through the gate. It is all quite narrow and gets very busy.",
          "You're guaranteed to see this if you're entering the old town. Pretty distinctive and distinctively pretty.",
          "Passing through the gate you'll see a statue of Dubrovnik's patron saint...St. Blaise. One of the main entrances to the City Walls is located here as soon as you walk in.",
          "Most visitors will enter the city via this gate as the main bus stop is right outside this area. It is a magnificently fortified entrance and is accessible to wheelchair users and buggies too as ramps exist to facilitate entry. It is busy at times but the crowds do thin out.",
          "All good things start here The pick up and drop off of both public and private transport and gateway to all entertainment Super busy in the daytime",
          "located in the entry point of old town. u can see the harbour from here. a lot of history around. a lot of other places around to see as well. many cafes, bars, restaurants and shops around. u got to walk from here, no car. nice sitting places are there around it. at night u",
          "One of the main gates and extremely busy. Once you enter after you push through the crowds you are greeted by a lovely fountain, the Stradum and tour groups. People tend to spend time here and it's the fate you'll most likely use if you are staying in the old city which I",
          "We strolled around for a bout 3 hours and happened on Pile gate the scenery around is lovely definitely recommend visiting the old town of Dubrovonik",

          "Walk into Old Town with zillions of visitors through this entrance----and begin to get excited as you view this fascinating Game of Thrones town. When you leave through this gate later in the day, you can easily catch a bus to anywhere you want!",

          "Many people rushing through in both directions. Lots of steps. Historically interesting. There are not very many ways through the walls so you will almost certainly go through. There are some nice sights of the ocean and walls just outside.",
          "Many interesting points of interest. Great views. Pricey restaurants but very flavorful cuisine. Healthy options available in terms of fresh juices, smoothies and shakes.",
          "Local buses stand outside this gate. Once you enter, to your left, you can start the city wall tour. The street there is called stradun and it is very famous. Lots of shops and restaurants around. If you keep going straight, you will eventually reach Ploce gate.",
          "You'll get a sense of history as you cross the drawbridge over the now waterless moat. You may cross more than once even on a two day visit to Dubrovnik.",
          "walking across the drawbridge, I can imagine when there was a moat. Very neat! Of course it is usually pretty crowded with tourists.",
          "This is a little beach area under the walls of old town. Kayak tour starts here. There are some quaint little cafes in the back streets away from the tourists .. very pretty little bay",
          "Impressive main entrance over (in olden times) a drawbridge. Bit of a tight squeeze for all the tourists - it has human traffic control. It has stairs and a ramp, so is accessible to pull suitcases if one is staying in the old town. Well restored with UNESCO funding after the",
          "Gate was too crowded. Try entering the city in the morning, to avoid the waiting. However, it has a nice view, and is good place to start the tour of the old town.",

          "The gate is beautiful but there are too many busses and cars double parking. Its s nightmare for vehicles. No vehicles can enter the old city. The gate has some rope barriers for incoming and outgoing pedestrians but this is not adhered to so one can sometimes get bombarded by",
          "Main entrance in the heart of Dubrovnik - old town. From the bridge which connects city and city walls great view to one of the towers and sea can be seen.",
          "Coming from the harbour, turn right and head up the hill past some interesting little shops. There's an area with stalls and seating looking out over the harbour. Head out through the gate and then you can get to the modern art gallery, sandy beach, cable car etc. We went back",
          "One of the four gateways into the old town. This one is the main gateway in and gets very crowded. The coaches drop off the cruise tourists nearby and makes for a very conjested entrance.It gives you a flavour of what you are about to see within the old town walled area.",
          "Magnificent structure, solidly built, I suspect most people don't see it as a defence, but as a means to get into the old city. It would have been almost impregnable in it's day",
          "The Pile Gate is the busiest part of Dubrovnik. During our second visit to the city, we virtually had to fight our way through the crowds at this gateway to both enter and leave the Old Town. The architecture dates back many centuries and it makes the gateway a very popular",
          "How can you review a gate into an old city? Yes it is an impressive construction of historic interest into an appealing attractive environment but it it is spoilt for me by the mass of relentless hordes of people who seem unappreciated by its significance",
          "Not the grandest of entrance gates, but if you have a vivid imagination, medival interests or a GOT fanatic then this is for you! If like most visitors you want easy uncrowded access to the old town, then enter from the old port end of Stradun and exit through Pile Gate.",
          "I wouldn't say that this is the greatest of spots for a photograph, but it certainly gives you a grand welcome entering the Old Town of Dubrovnik. A lot of people in the evening--try to avoid it if possible.",
          "This is the main entrance to the old city, it is part and parcel of the walk around the old town. In itself it is nothing spectacular but you must pass through it to get in.",
          "One may imagine King Arthur entering Dubrovnik on this gate - or Richard the Lion Heart, on the way to Crusades. That is why so many movies are being filmed here, or nonsensical series like Games of Thrones",
          "A quick entry into Stradum (the Main Street of the Old Town) as well as one of the entry points to the walls. If arriving by car, consider using the private parking area around 50m before the Pile Gate on the right hand side by the hotel. A bit more expensive than street",
          "Located near my hotel, this gate was my usual way into the old town. It is also the location where many bus tours deposit their passengers and is crowded with visitors, tour guides and tour companies selling their wares. Once again, evening time brings a quieter time to the gate",
          "The Pile Gate may be your first location in the old city and it sets the tone for the rest of the city. It is magnificent but can also be very crowded. (Our guide told us that it can take 1/2 in summer just to get through the gate.) Take your time, take in the sights and imagine",
          "Virtually nothing to see except one of the main entrances to the Old Town. The endless queue of cruise passengers boarding their coaches in time for their next on-board meal is to be avoided at all costs. They make access to the Tourist Information Centre and Bus Ticket Office",

The number of people trying to walk in and out is staggering, especially with the tour groups often stopping and blocking the way. You must be patient while making your way through the crowd",

Best time to visit Croatia is early or late season when the weather is not too hot for walking. 23c.to 25c.still hot enough to get a tan. Have a good time. Enjoy.",

Got my tan and enjoyed my time so much. Restaurants,boutiques,  souvenir shops and pf course Game of Thrones experience of the Red Keep and the shore.",

Bit expensive for got memorabilia but we bought it for them anyway. Lovely jewellery shops and handmade glass candle holders, also handmade pottery",

The gate itself is a fine piece of architecture and great for entering the city into the main street with immediate access to the city walls. Luckily the authorities operate an in and out lane system to avoid the entrance being a scrum.",

          "Nice historical please to take a picture for your memory.\nRecommended",
          "So touristy. Old town is gorgeous but it's almost hard to walk in the sea of people. The Dubrovnik Pass is worth it if you plan on going to museums/galleries within the walls - it also includes walking on the walls themselves. It costed me \u2026",

          "Very busy main entrance to the old city, but right next to the entry for the walls and meeting point for history walls. It\u2019s got a one way system, so easier to navigate other people than if it was left without.\nMake sure you see the changing of the guard, who march through the gate.",
          "It was nice to visit and walk about a little. Very very crowded with tourist though. Do not take the boat to the cursed island. Theres nothing there(just plants, seems like some people decided to swim at the beach-cos there's really nothing else to do). Waste of time.",

          "Nice historic and Game of Thrones site but it was hiving with tour groups .  If you hate big crowds then avoid it on busy days.  Plenty of shopping to be had for souvenirs and sweets. Lots of places to eat also. Word of advise. Arrive early as it will take a long time to see it all.",

          "A typical tourist attraction but in Dubrovnik nothing is typical. The Old Town is a wonderful place with small narrow streets, lovely street bars and many strolling cats everywhere. Wonderful place, visit it as soon as possible.",
          "It's a gate. Plenty of history to the place, but it is literally just a hole in the city wall, for people to enter through.",

          "Beautiful place although very busy still into October but worth going",
          "The natural starting point to any visit to Dubrovnik is this imposing city gate, built in 1537. While crossing the drawbridge, imagine that this was once lifted every evening, the gate closed and the key handed to the rector. Notice the statue of St Blaise, the city\u2019s patron saint, set in a niche over the Renaissance arch.",

You can buy on internet the Dubrovnik card which include this attraction. Just remember on Monday all museums are closed.",
          "What an amazing city. So glad it wasn\u2019t destroyed in the bombing. Story behind this guy carved out of stone is amazing. In order for a guy to save himself crime and punishment he had to jump on the rocking spin around. Without falling.",

          "Well preserved medieval fortified town. The city walls are a must but expensive at 25 euro pp. Very crowded.",

          "Nice place just prices are at least 3 times to high",
          "I liked the place, but busses come in on one lane which becomes closed as a one way street, so that the bus has to make a u-turn across three lanes of traffic. I had to load onto my bus in the middle of the street. Crazy!",
          "Great old town. Gets busy when the cruise ships are in town. Go early and best the crowds and heat.",
          "Impressive first look at this beautiful city.",
          "Nice architecture and good view over the bay. Beautiful in the night. Good pulse of people strolling around in the evening.",

          "History of the place. That it is a living functional city with its own schools, university, hospital, old age homes, etc.\nIt's super hot (sunny) and crowded. Also occasionally stinks, but all of it is totally worth a stroll through centuries!\nOf course, no cars allowed beyond the Pile gate (pronounced as pee-lay).",
          "Very beautiful place on the outskirts of old town debrovnik, overlooking the harbour and entrance to the Old city",
          "Loved it! Try to avoid in high season! Too many tourist and very little space.",
          "Beautiful Old City gate. Can get very crowded, and very expensive. Kotor is much nicer, smaller, and pleasant.",
          "Extremely full of tourists during peak season but an extraordinary city to see!",
          "Bonita entrada da oldtown in Dubrovinic",
          "This is the main entrance to the old town. By 10 am the entrance can get crowded as the cruise lines anchor off Dubrovnik and passengers come for a short visit. Look at the drawbridge which in earlier days used to be drawn up to close the city.",
          "Very crowded from April 15 to September. The sweet spot is last week of March to April 15th. Tolerably warm. Rain gear needed for this time period as it does tend to rain for part of the day then. Solid shoes or boots are needed as the worn stone walkways can be slippery when wet.",

          "Amazingly beautiful. Must go. Would suggest going in September as August is mad busy.",
          "So much history, architecture and atmosphere to soak up (not to mention the sun). If you decide to grab a bite to eat and are on a budget, I'd definitely suggest going to one of the side-street caf\u00e9s as the main street is very expensive (lesson learned, but the food and service were excellent anyway).",
          "Great site! Very busy in the morning but around d 4.30pm it was quieter",
          "Really nice when u walk in old city u will easy find",
          "The place itself is extremely beautiful, but the entrance tickets are really expensive and you fully pay even though in off season they work only untill 15h. At least they should give headphones with guidance for that money as in all historical places.",
          "Very beautiful spot but be aware how tourist oriented it is which makes it less appealing.",
          "An absolute must, make sure you do one of the walking tours, so much history and it is such a beautiful old town. I did a game of thrones tour if your into it it's awesome, you get to see where some of the scenes where shot",
          "Great Italian cuisine at very reasonable prices, I had lasagne which was delicious.",
          "Very nice to see the famous old town. Minus are the loads of toerists jammed in the city. Thats a deal breaker for me.",

          "If you don't like crowds then avoid - first time I've experienced a one way entry system to a town. It makes York look like a sleepy backwater. Suspect it's worse since Game of Thrones. It is, however, a beautiful place.",
          "The old city has two gates and this is the more practical entrance because the bus stop is there and you can always buy a ticket. Also, it's a perfect place to find an available taxi\u3002",

          "A fantastic entrance to the old city!  Very busy but it is one of the things you need to deal with. Be sure to look for the information on what areas of the city were damaged during the war.",

          "Great food and service! Highly recommended!",

          "All the buses to Lapad start here, big push to get on the bus. Must have been 30 over the max in UK. Don't try at 2pm as school home time. If you go on the wall, go early take water. Toilets close to the harbour left of gate. Take \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Sponza Palace (Croatian: Pala\u010da Sponza), also called Divona (from dogana, customs), is a 16th-century palace in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Its name is derived from the Latin word \"spongia\", the spot where rainwater was collected.\nThe rectangular building with an inner courtyard was built in a mixed Gothic and Renaissance style between 1516 and 1522 by Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107 Mihov. The loggia and sculptures were crafted by the brothers Andriji\u0107 and other stonecutters. \nThe palace has served a variety of public functions, including as a customs office and bonded warehouse, mint, armoury, treasury, bank and school. It became the cultural center of the Republic of Ragusa with the establishment of the Academia dei Concordi, a literary academy, in the 16th century. It survived the 1667 earthquake without damage. The palace's atrium served as a trading center and business meetingplace. An inscription on an arch testifies to this public function:\n\nFallere nostra vetant et falli pondera. Meque pondero cum merces ponderat ipse deus.\n\"Our weights do not permit cheating. When I measure goods, God measures with me.\"The palace is now home to the city archives, which hold documents dating back to the 12th century, with the earliest manuscript being from 1022. These files, including more than 7000 volumes of manuscripts and about 100,000 individual manuscripts, were previously kept in the Rector's palace.\nThe Lu\u017ea square in front of the palace is used for the opening ceremony of the Dubrovnik Summer Festival. Sponza Palace itself is also used as a performance venue.The palace's atrium is the basis of the \"Sponza Atrium\" 3D computer graphics model, created for a rendering contest and now a widely used reference model for global illumination rendering.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Sponza Palace\".

At its top is a large white stone cross and Fort Imperial, a defensive structure built by the French in 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars. Sr\u0111 is popular with tourists as a viewpoint from which it is possible to see the walled city of Dubrovnik, Lokrum island, the Adriatic Sea and various local attractions (including restaurants and the Stradun).\nSr\u0111 was once forested with oak trees which locals called dubrava (from the old Slavic word dub, \"oak tree\"), after which the city of Dubrovnik was named. The southern slope was once rich with pine forests, but in the second half of the 20th century and during the 1991\u201395 Croatian War of Independence, the forest was almost completely gutted through numerous fires. A zigzag Calvary leads up from the town.\nThe mountain was home to one of the fiercest battles of the Independence War, namely the Siege of Dubrovnik, and this is commemorated in a museum in Fort Imperial. The television mast was destroyed by fighter aircraft from the Yugoslav Air Force. The cable car that was disabled during this time has since been reopened, and Sr\u0111 has been developed as a tourist attraction, with a restaurant and a base for buggy safaris.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n200 years of Fort Imperial atop of Mount Sr\u0111",

          "The view from the top is breathtaking! There's also a restaurant up there so you can easily spend several hours. The cable car was quick but we were packed in and the lines were confusing at the top going back down. I waited in line for 10 minutes to then realize I was at the",
          "You should buy your ticket before from the net to avoid the queue. When up there stay until sunset to catch some beautiful night pictures of Dubrovnik by night !",
          "The worst bit about this attraction is the wait to get on the cable car! We went at about 10.30 and I think the queue was so long due to the arrival of a couple of cruise ships. Apart from that it was a great way to spend a few hours. The views from the cable car are pretty",
          "We are not GoT fans but everyone we knew had asked us to click picture of the old town from the cable car and they werent disappointed when we sent them the pictures!",
          "Dubrovnik cable car is a must do in dubrovnik. Preferably at sunset, though there are long lines - the sunset is beautiful from the top",
          "The car was running in August of 2019. Nice views from the top. I recommend also visiting the fort at the top and get a history lesson.",
          "This is a costly cable car ride. If you do not like to walk or cannot then it is OK. There are so many wonderful things to do and see in Dubrovnik with great views or cultural importance, this should be low on the list. Also there are lines for this.",
          "I don\u2019t hate a lot of things when I\u2019m on holidays, but I legit did not enjoy this at all, and in hindsight would not have bothered getting the cable car at all. My recommendation is to get a private car/taxi to the top! Why? Well it started with the ginormous earthworks",
          "Everything I read said this was one of the top attractions in Dubrovnik. Top rip-off is more like it. Way overpriced for the couple of minute view as you ascend. Nothing to do once you reach the top. We walked around and other than a little museum that you had to pay for",
          "Dubrovnik Cable car. The standard cable car ride that takes you tot he top of the hill overlooking the Dubrovnik walled city and the Adriatic sea. Relatively expensive, but worth doing it once. Lots and lots of tourists, long lines and packed cars. In peak season, timing will",
          "Well, we thought why not, might get some nice views. Well, you do, of the cable wires/ pillars while you go up and down. And the cable cars are packed with tourists clicking away, well, it was peak season. Best to buy your tickets at the cable car gates NOT at the main road",
          "Great views of Old Town and panoramic views of the ocean and islands. You can also enjoy them from the cafe.",
          "Would highly recommend taking the cable car ride, overlooking Old Town, especially around sun set. Gave a great perspective of Old Town, and the surrounding area.",
          "Awesome views. It was easy to find from the Dubrovnik walls. You need to use the Cable car to get to the top of the mountain Srd to appreciate the breathtaking views of the walled city and the adriatic sea! Worth every kuna!",
          "Brilliant views of the city and coastline when going up and down, recommend the cafe at the top of the ride, chill out there for a bit and get some pictures.",
          "excellent way to get a birds eye view of the city. If you can, take a tourbus, city bus, or cab to the cable car station, otherwise you have a steep 75 stair walk.",
          "The view on top of the hill was magnificent, but I didn\u2019t actually took the cable car. I had an uber took us to the top of the hill from Pile gate and you can enjoy the same view for fraction of the price, I paid about 100kn one way for four of us, instead of paying 90kn per",
          "Not cheap to ride cable car, but wow was it worth every Kuna, The views are stunning out to sea, of the Old Town, and of Lokrum Island, as well as looking inland (which cannot be seen from in town) This is a must if going to Dubrovnik.",
          "This is an amazing cable car trip ,it can be taken as a return trip or you can book to see fort srd ,this is a amazing place to see ,also a shocking one . You can see and read what happen in the homeland war , also take the steps to the top of the fort ,the view wow is all I",
          "The Dubrovnik old town is very picturesque, and you get a great view of it from the top of the cable car. You also get a fantastic view of the surrounding islands and the inland areas. It is also fun to hike around at the top.",
          "Fabulous views of the Old Town and suRrounding Islands. Smooth ride, fairly quick as well. Lovely bar at the top to have a drink and enjoy the views.",
          "As the day was sunny and not too windy, we decided to stop by at the top of the hill with cable car. From cable car opens nice view to the Old Town and Dubrovnik and also to the Babin Kuk peninsula. At the top there's popular restaurant, with nice views to the surrounding area.",
          "As we went to Dubrovnik beginning of November to mid November, the town was quiet, very quiet, which meant there was zero queue for the cable car and almost nobody at the top! We enjoyed spectacular views , it was peaceful and no stress at all. At the top of the cable car they",
          "The views from the top were great. The cable car was quick and reasonably priced, but check line if there are cruise ships in port, can be a long wait to get on. Got some good panoramas up to Cavtat",
          "Our group was at the ticket office just after the 9:00 am opening and had no wait - on a gorgeous, clear morning. We spent about an hour at the top, enjoying the views from the platforms, and some of our group of photographers went down a trail to the side so they could get",
          "Don't miss this option while visiting Dubrovnik!!! The views are sensational and the shopping and dining options were a pleasant surprise!",
          "Be prepared, you will have to queue for this. We went at the end of the season, and this was the only attraction that we found busy. So worth it though, the views are amazing, not just of the Old Town, but of the whole of Dubrovnik and the islands out to sea. The centre at the",
          "a bit expensive but great views making the trip worthwhile. One gets a much better picture of the mid '90,s war by going into the war museum. It is a short walk down the hill from the cable car and to the left.",
          "This costs \u00a320 for a return journey but the experience and views are well worth it. Tickets were easy to obtain and when we went was not overly busy. You get fantastic views from the top and the restaurant/bar at the top is lovely. Drinks here are dear at \u00a37.50 a pint but you",
          "very good trip but price high you can go one way but its 2 miles to come back. you get great views of dubrovnik not so easy to find as we came in from fort on foot. maybe as a trip would be take their as it out side of town about 10 mins walk . we just follow the wires .",
          "I took two-way ticket to enjoy the most beautiful and scintillating views of Dubrovnik Old Town and it's enchanting coastline. This brand new Cable car provide good facilities at the top including a cafe, souvenirs shop. There is also Panorama Restaurant to relax. The ramparts",
          "I had many visitors this year who said this was one of the best things they did. As with everything Dubrovnik these last years its overcrowded. But even given that the views are spectacilar.",
          "Amazing views and a great place to watch the sunset - a must for any visit to Dubrovnik! Get there early though as you can have a wait due to large groups visiting from tours / cruise ships!",
          "The cable car beggining station is very near Old town of Dubrovnik, and the drive to the top of the hill Sr\u0111, lasts shortly, 3-5 min. At the top amazing view specialy early in the morning or sunset time. Very expensive souvenir shops, but on tne way to cable car you can find",
          "Great attraction, nice view and food at the top. Nice to see all islands down under especially in nice weather.",
          "Fun place to watch the sunset, just allow enough time to wait in line and get up to choose your spot from lots of outside areas. There is also the option to walk the trail one of the ways which is well marked and also has nice views.",
          "The cable car ride was run by unfriendly staff, and once up on the top, the options were none to choose. Also, and most disappointingly, the city is not as well lit in the evening as other places, so once it gets dark, there's not much to look at",
          "The cable car is clean, the staff is respectful, but the trip down and back is just okay. Imagine being crammed into a glass booth. If you don't get to the front or aren't tall enough to see over the person in front of you, no point. Even then, it's just okay. Take the bus.",
          "I can\u2019t believe they charge so much for a 5 minute ride, I know there is a restaurant at the top but I just think the price is astronomical considering once you get to the top and see the view (albeit amazing) that\u2019s it and you\u2019re back down and you\u2019ve spent \u00a320! The view is",
          "Amazing view of whole area.Some people prefer cheaper option of taking taxi and it works out about \u00a318GBP or so for all over 15 years.Personally I think sometimes you got to take the tourist hit as it is a 1 off.View the same when you get to the top no matter what way you get",
          "I can see the appeal of this for those that may struggle to walk around Dubrovnik, but of all the amazing things we did on our trip this ranked very much last. It's popular with tour groups, not cheap, and you get to the top with little to do other than stand in a queue to go",
          "Fantastic views from the cable car station and restaurant. Might be a bit different at the height of the season but our experience was excellent. We are pleased to recommend it.",
          "A short trip but the views are stunning. Restaurant at top well worth a visit. Highly recommended on your trip.",
          "We went up the cable car mid afternoon when the queue was probably around 250 persons. Very busy but the views from the top are spectacular.",
          "Brilliant view of the surrounding coast line and especially the old town of Dubrovnik. We'll worth a trip (there is a footpath but not for me!). There is a restaurant, toilets and gift shop at the top. Also a buggy safari there too which we did and thoroughly enjoyed (and a zip",
          "A place to visit if you go to Dubrovnik. The spectacular views of this place will leave you breathless. The place is wonderful, on one side the sea and on the other the mountain. Your sight will be lost in the distance, where the sea kisses the sky is a poem for the senses. We",
          "A round trip will cost you 170 Kuna (around \u00a320) but the views on offer of the town are excellent and there is no pressure on the amount of time you are there. If you stop for a bite to eat or drink at the restaurant be prepared to part with a small fortune, but the food is well",
          "Well worth doing as you get great views from the top.Whilst it is pleasant to walk around there is a a great deal up there apart from an excellent restaurant with spectacular vies, so if you time it right you can include a leisurely lunch in your trip.You may have to wait at",
          "If you visit dubrovnik you must take in the views via the cable car. One of our group was afraid of heights however they found the cable care very smooth & not as scary as they thought it would be. The views are amazing & if you get chance see the sunset . Worth every penny .",
          "Went up e of those things that people suggest you do Mount Srd to watch the sunset. Lovely views although very busy with Asian Tourists. Cost was Quite expensive for a return trip 170 Kuna, around \u00a320 each. Would I say it was worth it, probably not. But it\u2019s one of those things",
          "We booked a return journey on the cablecar for an afternoon at the top of the mountain. This was 170kuna eachave. The cablecar holds about 30 passengers per car.The journey take just a couple of minutes to the top, but the views are spectacular. At the top the view speaks for",
          "We enjoyed our cable car ride,what an experience,stunning views at the top. It cost us \u20ac50 euros for the two of us.there where no ques,it\u2019s well worth a visit.",
          "Always a must visit for us when visiting Dubrovnik, the views are spectacular sea view looking down on the old town and along the coast. Took us 3 visits before we could get on because of the long queues created by the many day visitors from the cruise ships arrivals. Recommend",
          "very expensive for a 5 minutes ride, but once up we had amazing view of city wall, the sea and mountains. best thing to do is buy a single and walk back down",
          "i thought the ride duration was a little short. we did it one-way, & walked back down. wear decent shoes if you want to walk, cos there's lots of pebbles & rocks. start of the trail going down was kind of hard to locate, behind the very old building. the museum at the top is",
          "We went up in the cable car to enjoy the view. We were not disappointed. Well worth the money. Superb views and excellent museum and restaurant up there.",
          "Well worth the trip as the scenery is fantatstic. The bar and restaurant are good value too. Would definately recommend this",
          "Our hotel was less than 200 meters fro the cable car so we decided to ride to the top to watch the sunset. The ride took about 5 minutes. At the top are viewing platform and a bar and restaurant. Beautiful views of the city, the Adriatic and the sunset. Worth a visit if in",
          "Nicely done - regular service and promptly operated. Good views at the top of course. Not much else to say - it\u2019s s cable car!",
          "The cable car ride in Dubrovnik is a must visit! You view from the top is amazing ! We enjoyed the sunset @Panorama Bar sipping into our wine..it was a great evening!",
          "Nice views it cost us return. 25 pound each. Spent half an hour up there then returned. It's got a restaurant up there with views but did not use.",
          "We took the one-way trip (ascent) and for 90 kuna (\u00a311) it was worth it. We did a good walk along the top edge for a couple of kilometers and you get splendid views on the Old Town and islands and on the mountains and open country behind. You need to walk away from the top of",
          "The Dubrovnik cable car has an interesting view of Dubrovnik but walking the wall is much better. What is interesting is the war museum at the top of the ride. It's a short walk but well worth it although the line to get tickets and board the cable car is a problem. I suspect",
          "A must do, no question about it , about 20 euros return , try and avoid the cruise ship tour times because of the queues usually early, me thinks ..",
          "This is definitely a must do in Dubrovnik - the views are stunning, particularly at sunset. However for the cost, it seemed only worth it to go at this time, as otherwise we would have been disappointed. The price for a couple of minutes in the car was really overpriced, but the",
          "This is definitely a must.. it costs 170 Kuna and it doesn\u2019t matter if you buy the ticket ahead of time, by viator, a kiosk or when you\u2019re in the queue you will all still be in the same queue to get on the cable car! The queues are different daily so one time one day will be",
          "The views from the top of the cable car are simply breathtaking. I didn\u2019t think it was cheap but the view makes up for it.",
          "It was quite expensive to go up and down in the cable car but the views from the top are beautiful. There is a restaurant and fort at the top.",
          "We were recommended by friends to walk the walls of the old town. However, after taking the cable car there is no need, as you see it all and so much more from the top!! The view is breathtaking. My only advice would be to perhaps do it earlier in the day before the cruise ships",
          "It is just a few minutes cable car ride up to Mt. Srd and the cable car can fill around 30 people. Mainly it is a standing cable car ride with a few seats for the older people. The only interesting thing about the cable car ride is that from the hill you can take good pictures",
          "Very short wait in October, but I\u2019ll bet the lines are long during peak season. It would have been worth the wait anyway. Take the time, have a drink or lunch at the top. I wish we could have stayed for the sunset !",
          "If you wish to experience the cable car ride or see the view then worth the price but beware that it is very crowded at sunset and don\u2019t expect to get into the cafe if restaurant for drinks or a meal without a prior booking. Otherwise it is stand and see the view but nothing",
          "A must do if you\u2019re in Dubrovnik. A bit of a wait if the cruise ships are in (I recommend a Tuesday). But we\u2019ll worth the views. We had a drink at the restaurant at the top - amazing table right on the edge. Definitely recommend this.",
          "To avoid a very long wait, I suggest getting there at least a half hour before the first cabin leaves. The views are spectacular",
          "Being afraid of heights, the cable car was not my first choice of things to do on this trip. Though I have to admit it has been one of the best memories of the trip so far. I collected my tickets from the booth at the entrance to the cable car. Costing around 140kuna. You can",
          "If you\u2019re on a budget I\u2019d skip this one. Yes, the view was great and we rode in a cable car but $40cdn each seemed steep to us. The ticket we purchased included the museum about the war of the 1990\u2019s and we\u2019re glad we saw it. There\u2019s a restaurant at the top that was priced",
          "Wow, Old town itself was gorgeous but out trip was made by the views down to old town from the top of the cable car trip. Be sure your camera is charged. Smooth ride and well organized but do go early to avoid overcrowding. By 11am it was becoming annoying.",
          "Nice views of old town, we went up in late afternoon around 4pm. It wasn't too busy going up but queues were very busy going down. You get a good view all around, mountains at the back towards Bosnia and Montenegro. Paths around are gravel so good footwear is needed. Nice",
          "Loved this quick and easy way to get to the top of the hill overlooking gorgeous Dubrovnik town. The war museum at the top is not sign-posted very well, but well worth the visit, especially when you go to the roof for the view! Sensational....",
          "Panoramic view across Dubrovnik Quite expensive but worth the money Nice restaurant at the top which does amazing Baileys Coffee",
          "Riding the cable car to get a view of the old city was a worthwhile activity. The views are spectacular! The line moved at a reasonable pace. A must do activity.",
          "Unmissable, very frequent and there\u2019s a view at the top you won\u2019t forget - the sea and the sky appear to go on forever. Fantastic overview of the old city. Make sure you get the combined ticket for 200 kuna which is a return journey plus admission to the war museum. The museum",
          "Stunning views of the old town and coastline. Museum at the top offers a short but informative journey through the homeland war. Knowing what they have been through , can\u2019t help but admire the people of this little corner of the world.",
          "Trip up the cable car a must whilst in Dubrovnik. There is a great restaurant at the top, a bit pricey but worth it. The food was excellent and the octopus terrine was exceptional. The local wines are very good and the staff very welcoming and knowledgeable about the food and",
          "Arrived just after the cruise ships so there was a bit of a queue on the way up but not too long and no queue on the way down. Awesome views",
          "The cable car was very busy but the waiting time wasn\u2019t that long. The journey was enjoyable , the car was not to crowded. The fort at the top of the car was interesting and gave an insight into how Dubrovnik was affected by war 1991- 1995.",
          "Visited the cable car at sunset and saw a great view of the city whilst enjoying a lovely cocktail in the bar at the top,definitely reccomend a visit",
          "As with EVERYTHING in Dubrovnik this cable car ride is very overpriced! Works out around \u00a325 per person for a round trip 3 min journey up the cliffs to an overpriced restaurant. View is lovely but not worth the money.",
          "This cable car just happened to pass directly over our rental apartment. Everyone we saw at the top and those passing over us seemed happy with the experience.",
          "We took the cable car up to have dinner at the Panorama restaurant ( see separate review). I\u2019ve rated it 4/5 due to pricing -it\u2019s \u00a320 return each - and the online booking process is rubbish. There\u2019s a few things to do at the top but the best is the view. Go just before sunset",
          "Well worth going up if for nothing more than the view. We went up outside the high season and still had to Q for nearly 39 minutes. So be prepared.",
          "Dubrovnik is such a beautiful city and it was great to see it from such a height. The views and the outdoor restaurant at the top made it a very pleasant late afternoon visit. The only downsides were the crowded cable car (both ways, although we realise it was peak season),",
          "The views are beautiful but it is a very short ride in the cable car. 170kuna return. You can also do a one way trip for 90k and walk back if you have time. Lovely panoramic views at the top plus restaurant and a war exhibition which you have to pay to go in. Also the obligatory",
          "We didn't pre book but found it easy with just a small queue and the views were amazing from the top.",
          "Would recommend going early as there are usually long queues. Beautiful views from the car..would recommend buying a ticket in advance.",
          "Well worth a trip, only takes 4 minutes, fantastic views over Dubrovnik, also the museum of The homelands war is up there at the top.",
          "The cable car was fun for the few minutes it takes to get to the top but there isn\u2019t much going on up there. A single restaurant. Some nice views but not worth the cost.",
          "Even though the ride is expensive, it is also exciting. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. There is the Old Town like a doll house, and the endlessness of the sea around it. Equally impressive are the bare mountains on the other side. Here, one can gain an",
          "We took the cable car up in the late afternoon so it wasn\u2019t too busy. The views at the top are worth the ride . We decided to walk down with was quite tough. The path is loose gravel and rock so you have to watch every step and there\u2019s no shade until you get between the trees",
          "Had about a 30 minute wait to get into a gondola which hold about 20 people and takes about 5 minutes to get to the top. Plenty of places to admire the views in all directions and some expensive places to eat and drink. We stayed up about 40 minutes and enjoyed the experience",
          "This is an amazing trip very high but there is about 25 to 30 people in with you so stand in the middle if you don't like heights as the view from the top is aw inspiring not to be missed.there is a cafe and shop at the top.",
          "Absolutely stunning views from the top, well worth the visit! Go before sunset and stay to watch it go down and you will get the perks of both daytime and night time views as well as a beautiful sunset",
          "This jaunt is well organized and run. The views are awesome. The on top facilities are very nice. Worth the time.",
          "We used the cable car last week when visiting the area. We went early to avoid queues and it was very quick to the top. The price is around \u00a320 but worth the views. Believe you can walk but it would be steep and hot and would take around an hour or so. Recommend going early. The",
          "The view from my airb&b was just as breathtaking so it was not something you need to do. Going up the cables are in the way for a good shot and the only thing that was an eye opener was the landscape on the southern side of the mountain...quite desolate compared to the",
          "At \u20ac25 return this wasn't a cheap trip but it does get you to the view point quickly and the views are stunning. Was a bit of a squeeze due to large volume of tourists but more fun than a traditional taxi.",
          "From the top there's a great view of the Old Town. You can't tell it's packed with cruise ship passengers.",
          "Short wait to get on (shorter than the line may look like). Smooth ride. Fantastic view from the top.",
          "When you are in the Old Walled City of Dubrovnik it is like going back in time living in a vibrant city of the 7th century only people are dressed modern. While there a must is to take the 4 minute cable car ride up the2552 feet mountain to see a very real view of the",
          "A bit of a queue to start off the trip but went down quickly. Car rides both ways were quick but if your last on your in the middle so no view. Stunning views from the top and well laid out, for this alone well worth the money. Again queued for the trip down but with some",
          "The journey to Mount Srd is smooth and steady. They do like to have the cars as full as possible so do not like it if you want to wait for the next cable car. The viewing platforms itself are average. To get a better view free from the balcony and obstructions you can walk",
          "The view is stunning and especially if you go to the top of the war museum. The museum was heart breaking. Although I live in Europe, I had no idea what really went on. The restaurant at the top of the cable car is very good, not at all the tourist trap I was expecting.",
          "Having just arrived in Dubrovnik, the host at the apartment we rented suggested we should take the cable car up for a sunset view. We decided to stay for dinner at the Restaurant & Bar Panorama. Well worth it (it take a bit of time to get back on the cable car after sunset but",
          "I had a wheelchair which initially wasn't a problem, the staff were friendly & very helpful. However once we had paid & went to the top, the lift to the other levels had broken down & was in bits (something that wasn't mentioned), so we weren't able to visit the cafe to eat or",
          "Hike (many steps) to the city gate (opposite the sea) and catch the gondola to the top of the mountain. The Croatian flag and a large cross can be seen atop from the city below. There is a nice restaurant at the top as well. Reservations needed and ask for a window seat. There",
          "We queued for about 30 minutes to get up to the cable cars, if I was to go again I would consider hiking up as a lot of people did and it didn\u2019t look too hard. It was a lot of money but the view was breathtaking! We spend about an hour up there, didn\u2019t have a drink at the",
          "Visited on a Saturday in October. You can only pay cash at the ticket offices near the old town but at the station you can pay by card. We went up and there was no queue but can imagine it gets busy. Yes it\u2019s expensive. But yes it is worth it. Clear day and amazing views. When",
          "Bit of a wait to get on but a well organized and very clean operation. Smooth ride to the top. And then - what magnificent views; well worth the money. You can see across the old town of Dubrovnik with its historic walls and the wonderful adjacent harbour & coastline plus",
          "It was a bit hard to find the way to where the cable car started in Old Town, but there all went very smooth, and we did not have to spend much time waiting. The way up was good, and the view stunning. Good facilities at the top, both to take photos and have something to eat or",
          "Classic Swiss Construction Cable Car. Faultless operation. It was very busy during our visit and the queues especially to come down (queueing inside the building with no views) could be managed better. As we are British we know how to deal wit a queue but it was very frustrating",
          "The ride lasts less than 5 minutes and it is way too expensive. Once you get up the top there is a cool war museum and a nice spot for a sunset or drinks. So while I do recommend going up, I would recommend taking an Uber up, far cheaper and you're not missing anything as the",
          "The cable car was brilliant once we finally got on. We queued for over an hour, which we expected, however as we approached the turnstile two HUGE groups of cruise ship passengers approached with bulchy guides who pushed thorugh all of the queue and proceeded to let over 200",
          "Pros: - it\u2019s clean - it\u2019s frequent - the view from the top is amazing Cons: - as cable cars go it\u2019s pricy - there are no signs telling you which direction to queue in / where to queue. - staff seemed like they where bored and done. We went for the sunset which is",
          "If you are selfy lower this is definitly right location for you. It is not cheap, almodt 15\u20ac for 5 minutes driving but wiev is amaizing and you can meditate looking on the old city.",
          "Obviously, on a good day, the views are striking. But if you have walked the walls of the town, which is the best way of seeing the place, then paying for the cable car may not seem like good value. It costs A LOT. If you do go, make sure to check out the museum.",
          "This is definitely a must-do for those travelling to Dubrovnik. It\u2019s not too expensive and the cable car takes you to the point within a few minutes. The view is breathtaking - probably one of the best in the city!",
          "The cable car gives a fantastic view of old town Dubrovnik. The line up moves pretty quickly and the cable car moves very smoothly. We all enjoyed the ride. The restaurant up top is very nice but a little expensive.",
          "Stunning views from the top, especially at sunset! Be prepared to queue both to go up and to return. The restaurant at the top is lovely but pricey; had to queue there as well. Worth it for the divine aperol spritz and stylish cheeseboard.",
          "Lovely ride to the top and bottom of the city. The price was a bit of a issue. We've travelled a lot and found the price to be to high for what it was. Yes you get good views but ultimately it's a lift and you're going up and down for 2 mins.guys people use it as they have to so",
          "Easy and fast queuing a nice ride to the top and a lovely restaurant with spectacular views of Old Town.",
          "It costs \u00a310 or so each way so not cheap. The views from the top are nice - better if you see around sunset time. There is a restaurant up the top and also a war museum - nothing else.",
          "Great attraction, expensive the round trip but the views are awesome of the old town very recomended",

          "The cable car at sunset is a MUST do. Be aware that if the day is windy, the cars won't operate, so on the first available day, if you can get there, don't gamble and push it off until the end. I would be in line about an hour or so before sunset or you're risking things.",
          "Not particularly cheap working out at around \u00a320 per person. That said the views are amazing. We went to see the sunset and weren\u2019t disappointed. The restaurant prices for drinks were comparable to the rest of old town. A must to see the old town, fort and Adriatic at its best.",
          "Best part of \u00a320 is steep but so is the hill and I wouldn\u2019t fancy walking it in this heat. Stunning views and a nice cafe/restaurant at the top make a nice spot for a drink and one hell of a view",
          "Views are amazing from the cable car and numbers restricted on each journey so no jostling for position to see the views! It is however very pricey forsuch a short trip! Great view from the top and restaurant there very good but make sure you ask for a table with a view!",
          "We opted to get the single ticket as we wanted the adventure of walking down. The views while on the car are spectacular but not nearly as good as those from the summit. \u00a310 for a single ticket was a bit steep in my opinion.",
          "Went with my husband, I hate heights but my husband really wanted to do this cable car. There was quite a wait but maybe that\u2019s because I was hanging back. Once the ordeal of the cable car was over I did enjoy the views from the top and also went to the museum at the top, worth",
          "We took the advice of others and went early. This turned out to be a good choice as we only waited around 10 minutes to board the cable car. As we were waiting two coaches full of visitors arrived so very glad we were able to go on first. The ride to the top only takes a few",
          "whilst in Dubrovnik a trip up on the cable car is a must for the views, how ever the price for said trip was over priced and very short,",
          "We went up the cable car at about 4pm, just before the evening rush to see the sunset. If you're planning on eating up here or having a drink while the sun sets I'd advise booking a table. Not all tables have a good view though. The staff on the cable car were pleasant enough.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyable activity. The cable car is quick and efficient and the views from the Mount are spectacular. The museum at the top is sobering as it concerns the 1991 to 1995 conflict, full of detail and personal stories.",
          "You can get a better view of the city if you go to Fort Lovrijenac plus the price is already included in the city wall price. This is not a bad activity, just very much over priced and the photo shots from up the hill will include the lines for the cable cars. If you want the",
          "Whilst the cable car was a nice novelty, the restaurent is quite pricey for the food/drinks on offer. The view is obstructed by the cable car itself, for a much better experience i recommend the walk either up or down Mount Srd where the views are breathtaking.",
          "Great view of The Old Town, walked back down, the path is rough underfoot and winding. Well worth spending 2 or 3 hours doing this!",
          "It's good to see the views from the top. Beautiful- but it's a quick trip unless you take lots of photos. The wall has views almost as good. It is an experience tho",
          "If you want a birds eye view of Dubrovnik and the Adriatic Sea beyond the Cable Car gives a fantastic view point from which to see the City.",
          "Fabulous views of this city...easy to get to and modestly priced...great value for the best holidays snaps....go early and avoid the crowds...",

          "\u00a350 (ish) for 2. This for all of 772 metres up to the top of Mount Srd (and down). Worth every Kuna. Breath taking views atop of the Hil that overlooks the beaugtiful old city.",
          "A very good way to view the old city and port, Adriatic coast and the region's mountains. Only a 5 minute ride, approx 20 in a car so queue goes quite quickly but to avoid long waits go later in the day once cruise ship visitors have left. You can also see a fabulous sunset over",
          "Hubby & I were staying very close to the Cable Car experience. It was a definite must do on my list whilst staying in Dubrovnik. The views are amazing & we decided to have lunch at the outdoor restaurant while there. Just a perfect day!",
          "An expensive trip for what it is, replies on how many customers waiting, if not enough to fill the car then you have to wait. Only 2 cars but can still be a long wait. Very good views from the top.",
          "A must when visiting Dubrovnik. It was a great way to travel to see the amazing views and to visit the homeland museum which was interesting and very sad on what happened in 1991 to Dubrovnik and it\u2019s people The restaurant was great too we only had a cocktail so couldn\u2019t comment",
          "We walked up to the top of Mount Srd and took the cable car back down. 'Twas a good decision. The walk up, while somewhat arduous, is quite doable, although rocky, so a good pair of shoes or hiking boots would be your best bet. The view is spectacular. Cable car is now 90/170",
          "Good way to get up Mt Srd, but not cheap - about \u00a320pp return trip. It is possible to walk up or get a taxi. The cafe at the top is good, and the views are spectacular. In september the queue for the cable car was only about 15 minutes wait.",
          "The view on the hill is great edpecially in the evening when the sun is going down. Take time when you have to vome down again.",
          "As you can easily see from the pictures view is fantastic from the top. And actually on your way to the top and back too... We went around midday and crowd was reasonable but it was getting more crowded all the time. We also got a table from Panorama restaurant right when we got",
          "We enjoyed the amazing views of Dubrovnik at the top of the cable car ride. We did have a bit of a wait to come down due to tourist numbers but it is worth the effort. Just do it - you won't be disappointed!",
          "The ride up the mountain overlooking Dubrovnic is short and sweet. Pricing of \u20ac21 pp is exorbitant, given that it is but a few minutes and the cable cars are rather busy. However, the views from above are spectacular, best obviously on a clear, not a hazy day. But certainly",
          "My friend and I decided to do the cable car to see Dubrovnik from a height. If you have been on one of these before, there will be no surprises. There's a line to go up and a longer line to come down. It's a great view from the top. There is a restaurant at the top--I",
          "Took a cab up to Restaurant Panorama and the cable car down. Highly recommend the cable car for both the beautiful and the quick Ride down.",
          "Sweeping views of Dubrovnik and the Adriatic coastline. A must do in my opinion. Everything up top is a touch overpriced , so just be prepared.",
          "Took the cable car up and went to the war museum on the top. The view from the top is lovely and there is a restaurant you can eat at but may want to make reservations before. We did not eat there, just went for the view and the museum.",
          "Cable car gives an amazing view from above the city, (small shops etc at the top but prices loaded!!)",
          "Fantastic views from the top and the war museum is a must visit. Very informative and very well presented. All in all a must do when u visit Dubrovnik",
          "Astonishing views at sunset. It would it been unbeatable if the terrace was at the right side to avoid seeing the cables from the cable car while the sun goes down.",
          "Though we can hike up or drive yourself/taxi, this cable car ride was worth the 170Kuna ($25) round trip. It takes only 4minutes but very steep hill on the hot day even 4pm when we went, I rather enjoy this scenic ride. They limit the number of passenger on each car and when it",
          "We only came down on the cable car rather than buying the return ticket. It\u2019s well staffed and organise with a car going up and down every 5-10 mins. About 20 people fit in easily and the views are worth the ride. You get up or down in 4 mins.",
          "The cable car costs $37.00 Canadian for a couple of minutes. They jam you in, so there\u2019s no way to get photos on the ride up. Once you\u2019re up there, although the view is amazing, you can\u2019t get good pictures as the cable car pylons rare in the way. Waste of money",
          "My sister and I visited here on Saturday morning 28th September(11am) despite being told about the long queues we were very lucky in that there wasn't any kind of queue! The ride was very quick and smooth,once on top the views are amazing, it is very rough ground so if you",
          "The ride up was easy , lightly loaded car with plenty of room to take pictures. The ride back down was a wait - about three or four cars worth and the line was a challenge on and off. Easiest way up to the top of Mt Srd.",
          "This costs 170 kuna (\u00a321) per person for a return trip up to Mount Srd where you get a fantastic view over Dubrovnik and the Elphiti Islands. There is a restaurant at the top as well as the Homeland Museum. There is also a 4 Wheel buggy experience around the mountainside if",
          "I was lucky to get a front row seat of this quick journey up the mountain. It is really convenient to see the sunset of Dubrovnik.",
          "If you want to see sunset from the hill I strongly recommend to arrive early as there is a long waiting line. The ride is smooth and fast and totally wlrth the money you pay. You can also go on top with your own car if you like narrow roads. You see sheep and goats on top and",
          "This short ride was a great way to overlook Dubruvnik and Lapad area. We went up at 6pm before the sunset and watched it go down. Amazing sights and dinner at Panorama restaurant at the top of the lookout. It's a good idea to buy tickets in advance then go up later in the day.",
          "You must do the cable-car trip to the hill overlooking Dubrovnik. The queues were manageable short and the views were spectacular. We combined the cable car trip with a visit to the war museum, which adds to the value of the elevated experience.",
          "This is a definite must when in Dubrovnik. The vistas are amazing, the resturant is very good, however for early travelers the kitchen opens at 1100. Prior, sweets are only available as well as beverages. The museum at the top, is the only way to understand the recent history",
          "Amazing views but very expensive. Mo much to do when you are in the top maybe is worth going by taxi/walking",
          "The spectacular views come at a price ($$) and long wait (~20+ minutes) in the line to go up if you want to visit around sunrise / sunset. I hear that the lines are also worse during the day when gigantic cruises unleash thousands of passengers into Dubrovnik. :( However, I am",
          "When you arrive at the town departure station you don't need a ticket while queueing. You can buy one while you are waiting for your cable car. Under the covered area there is a ticket kiosk. Mentioning this as taxi drivers will ask tourists if they have a ticket and try and get",
          "The cable care ride is very short, you need to wait in a long line to get in, it runs in 2 cars, each can take up to 30 people so inside the car you can be crowded actually by people. If you wan to go up the mountain yo enjoy the amazing view from the top, which is completely",
          "Best to reserve your visit to avoid a long wait. Its also nice to have a drink/appetizers so you can take in the views and the ambiance.",
          "Wasn't necessarily worth the money or hype but glad we did it. Tour groups have separate entrance area which is not marked so it appears like people are cutting the line which is super irritating",
          "Fantastic views. Well worth the visit. War museum is a must see. Walk around outside, great view of mountains.",
          "An amazing experience. New yacht, fresh food and great staff. You can trust Edo to take care of your return taxi to safe return to the hotel. Edo - thank you!! You are A man of a word Tony",
          "Having visited the cable car many years ago as a couple we wanted to revisit with our young daughter (22 monthd) This activity is great and although overpriced would highly recommend for families with young children (they travel free of charge). When we visited there was quite a",
          "We went three times to access the cable car which closed suddenly due to concerns about winds so best to buy when you get on site as it's not predictable when it will run. The war museum at the top is worth visiting and it provides moving testimonials from the 90s war. Be",
          "If you only have a short time in Dubrovnik I would skip the cable cars up to Mount Srd. Your time would be better spent walking the city walls and exploring the side streets in old town. The cable cars are a bit pricey for what you get at 20 Euros - the same price you pay to",
          "Busy Dubrovnik cable cars go up and down a very steep incline providing a great view of the surrounding area. The ride is rather short.",
          "its overpriced but so is everything in dubrovnik! however once at top you do get nice views. Best to go for sunset as a good point to watch.",
          "We took a cable car at 6pm to view the sunset. Great way to catch the last rays at the top. The ride, though, was relatively short and not spectacular, compared to other cities' cable car rides.",
          "We bought tickets there, cash only! Took the cable car at 10am, 2 min. later we were at the top, walked down, incredible views to the old town. With taking breaks and eating took an hour to the old town.",
          "The best way to see the city is from the top of the hill, now you could walk up, (some did!!!). But the fastest and easiest is the cable car, the view is great. There is a restaurant at the top, we didn\u2019t use it but it looks pretty good.",
          "Cable car to the top, had to queue for about ten minutes- they go down quickly because they fit about thirty people in each car. Fabulous views both ways. We went for lunch in the outdoor restaurant, we didn't book but they just ask you to stand at a table whilst they find you a",
          "We heard about the cable car to the top of Mt. Srd from friends. We hesitated to go because of the crowds, especially the cruise ship masses. We took a chance and had a great time! The lines were full, but moved quickly. But, what a spectacular view on the way up and down!",
          "\u00a340 return to the top and back. Nice outside area Though be prepared to share a standing table. Not worth it really... staff were pretty good. Advice would be to walk up...there will be a way.",
          "The cable car is good fun, and you can enjoy spectacular views of the old city and surrounding areas. It\u2019s not cheap, and when we arrived around 11am there was a big queue. Interestingly by midday it had almost vanished, so I guess it depends on the luck of the draw and how many",
          "If you come to Dubrovnik you definitely should see the view from the top. Eat at the restaurant (it's really good compared to most tourist traps, it's owned by the same group as Dubrovnika at the entrance to the old town) and take some time to soak it all in. Lovely.",
          "This was to expencive! The ride last about 2 minutes and cost 90kuna=12 euro for one way! Not much to see on top. We took the cable cart up and Uber down. But we wiched we stayed in old town. 170kuna/person for round trip! No thanks. But sadly the only option i see to get up",
          "It was around 50 gbp for 2 of us the ride took 4 mins each way! There are poor stray dogs at the top that no one seems to want to help or even comment on if you ask about them. Very disappointed .. Poor value and hard to find and not worth the effort!",
          "The tickets are $25.00 USD per person. The view of town was beautiful however the cables run through every picture. There was no safe place to take a picture without the cables in them. People were climbing out onto the rocks for pictures without the cables taking a chance of",
          "We bought our tickets from a tourist information office after getting off a local ferry boat into the old port. This meant that we did not have to queue at the cable car itself. Although they try to keep separate queues for those with tickets and those without often its",
          "Very expensive with nothing to do once at the top. Good views of the town can be got from walking the walls",
          "Well worth the money & time..We went late afternoon to catch the sunset. There is a restaurant and terrace bar at the top to round off the experience.",
          "The price is a tad steep - so one who was not that keen had her mind made up by the price! A tip - buy your ticket at the bottom kiosks. At least then if you choose to join the line when you get near the front you can just scan it and you will jump 20 or 30 places of those who",
          "The line to get up to see the sunset from the fortress at the top was long for us - 40 minutes. Plan accordingly if you want to see sunset. Also know there are taxi drivers at the cable car station that will take you to the top and you can take the cable car down. Don't buy",
          "Widely known as one of the must do's in town, can see why.. It offers a stunning view of the old Town and New city, the blue sea in the background appeals richly and adds to a classic beauty of the whole town. No jerky rides either way, but got to stand in a queue as tourists",
          "Try and avoid the queues by going after 12 and don\u2019t get too put off by the amount of people - some will be queueing for a bus! You can buy a ticket at the kiosk by the actual cable car or exchange your vouchers there so don\u2019t panic if you\u2019re not sure. This is a pleasant ride",
          "Gorgeous views but $50+ a bit pricey for a ride up the hill and back. I guess it\u2019s one of those things you have to do once.",
          "The ride up to the top was not great but once you\u2019re at the top it was an excellent view nice breeze is a nice place to sit and have refreshments. However if you missed it don\u2019t worry about it. Dubrovnik is way too crowded I would recommend not going .",
          "This was on our to do list while on holiday in Croatia and it was well worth it. We had already gone the city wall, also a must. So decided to go back for the cable car. No queue for the car and not over crowded. Great afternoon with great views.",
          "I feel the cable car was a bit pricey for what you got. 340 Kuna for 2 round tip tickets is way too much. However, the view was incredible and I would highly recommend you drive up instead of take the cable car.",
          "If you are going to Dubrovnik the cable car is work a visit before you go to the old town it just puts the old town in perspective, of the work that went into building the walled town. Not a cheap ride but we enjoyed,lovely location for lunch",
          "Fantastic views. No need for a reservation at the over priced restaurant. Bring something and go to the left when you exit the cable car. Beautiful view of the whole bay for free with plenty of place for everyone.",
          "After several recommendations from friends, me and my boyfriend took the cable car up to watch the best sunset over Dubrovnik and surrounding islands. The view was beautiful and definitely worth the trip. The cable car is a little expensive for what it is, as you are only in it",
          "This is a must for travellers in Dubrovnik as the views from the top are stunning. There is also a restaurant at the top where the food is very good and reasonably priced. We made the mistake of arriving late morning and were stuck in the queue behind three separate cruise tours",
          "Although you have to wait when busy, cruise liner passenger! You were not overly packed into the car to travel up to the top. I felt comfortable, I had to go alone as husband not too keen on heights! But worth it for the view over the Old Town and over to the pennisular and",
          "It was easy and in-expensive to get the best views of old town, the walls,Dubrovnik, Lokrum Island and the Adriatic in the comfort of a cable car. Unlike, Rio de Janeiro's Sugar loaf cable car, this one has only one ride. However, the scenes are very delightful. More so, there",
          "It is a tad pricey but we do like a cable car. Current price as of Sept 2019 was 170kn for a return ticket. The entrance is on the mountain side of the old town by the entrance. From the Pile bus stop you just follow the road around the outside of the walls & eventually you will",
          "We took the cable car up and walked down took about an hour but the path was lots of loose stones etc u def need the right shoes and to be quite mobile. The views at the top were great. We were a little disappointed at how many people were crammed into the cable car especially",
          "We queued but moved up fast as the two cable cars take 30 people at a time and the whole trip takes a mere 3 minutes. Breath taking views, so scary for some that they travelled with eyes closed. Marvelous photo opportunities if you stand at the front of the carriage at least",
          "Well worth the trip 170HRK return 90 HRK one way We decided to walk back, its a rough and bouldery walk so wear decent shoes or boots. It took us 1 hour to walk back from the top to Pile Gate, at Fort Imperial follow it round to the right to find the path",
          "The views at the top are totally worth seeing (especially at sunset) but I recommend taking a taxi there or walking. The cable car ride lasts maybe a full minute? Probably less. Definitely not worth the money or time waiting, which for us was around a half hour at least (unless",
          "Magnificent views from the top. Gives you a great overview of all of the old town and surrounding areas. Great photo ops. We went to a war museum at the top which was very touching. Long queue at both ends os cable car were hot and annoying, so suggest early or later in day.",
          "The summit of this cable car has spectactular views and gives a bit of an insight into the troubles of previous years",
          "Definitely worth going. The view is magnificent from the top. We went there to see the sunset and it was beautiful. The only problem was that it was very crowded on the top. The row was so big we had to wait outside of the building.",
          "Stunning views of Old Town, surrounding area and the Med. At the top there is an abandoned Fort which is very interesting but brings home the reality that only 24 years ago war was raging in this area.",
          "We decided to hike instead of taking the cable car. Its 7km round walk. The cable car itself takes about 3 min or less to get up there. You can go up and down for 170 kunas, or walk up and get the car back for 90 kunas. Wouldn't walk down after sunset, very uneven surface and",
          "The cable car views were amazing. Get there early, the line gets long, but does move quickly. The war museum on top is worth the visit. Make a reservation to eat at the Panorama restaurant at the top.",
          "Had been to Dubrovnik before but never been up the cable car. Was amazing. A good price (170 kuna) and amazing value for the views you get of the city - takes less than 5 minutes each way!",
          "Great quick way to get to the top (of course!) The cost was 90 kunas (\u00a311) each way. Personally I couldn't see a great deal due to the amount if people in the cable car and 3 rude people hogging the front and unwilling to even squeeze up or rotate. However the views from the top",
          "Take the cable car to the top, the views are spectacular of the old town, environs, islands and the mountains in the East towards Bosnia. If you have the time and want to save money, car up, walk down. Also visit the Napoleonic Fort and museum devoted to the Croatian Homeland",
          "Good way to see the old town and the Elafiti islands ! The queues were longer in the evening, but worth the trip for the panoramic views !",
          "Take this cable car up the mountain above the old town. Fantastic views on the way up and down and especially at the top. There is a restaurant at the top where you can have a drink or lunch and enjoy the view. There is also a war museum at the top that if you have the time",
          "I was absolutely awestruck with the views from the top. I had seen pictures online and from friends who had been previously but nothing can prepare you for seeing the views in person. The cable car took a couple of minutes at most to get to the top and the reward is incredible.",
          "It\u2019s expensive for what it is, I would recommend buying a one way ticket and get an Uber back, cheaper and about as scenic once you are all packed into the cable car. I would highly recommend bringing cash so you can visit the old fortress up the top of the mountain.",
          "A novel way of getting up to the most amazing views and restaurant. Queues quite long however and not cheap at \u20ac20 each for a few minute ride.",
          "We joined the queue around 9.15, and it was reasonably large. Just beat the tour busses (and that increased the queue. Top tip - join queue and get another in your party buy tickets, as you need to scan your ticket prior to boarding. Restaurant at top has magnificent views, but",
          "The cable car is an incredibly popular tourist attraction. It is well-run and efficient, but a round trip is rather expensive (especially if you\u2019re in a group of 3-5 people, it adds up quickly) and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be jammed in the middle of the car and won\u2019t really",
          "Its a must if you are in Dubrovnik! There might be a long line for this but its worth the wait......",
          "Long lines to get into the cable car, and a short ride once on, but the views are worth it, particularly if you time it around sunset.",
          "The cable car ride offers a beautiful view of Dubrovnik and the Adriatic but once you\u2019re on top is the best! Just spectacular! Have a meal or just drinks in the cafe overlooking the view.",
          "After reading some of the reviews I was expecting a frosty reception with rude staff , however it was the polar opposite. Friendly ladies x 2 in the ticket office / car controls was a nice surprise. Tickets are a bit on the expensive side considering it\u2019s very short trip up but",
          "Can get the cable car up at night. No waiting and very clean, fast car. View at the top is worth seeing. Absolutely stunning.",
          "We were going to restaurant panorama and took cable car up. Literally in it for 5 mins and it costs \u00a320 a head return. Next time we will take our taxi here or walk!!!",
          "Line was pretty quick, spent about an hour and a half up the top. If worried about cost, always potential to get a one way ticket and brave the walk back down! Sunset Views: Unsuspecting Gem!!!",
          "A fab ride up the cable cart to see the views. The sunset was pretty! There\u2019s three levels and a restaurant available also!",
          "Had the most amazing experience going on this and my partner also loved it and he is scared of heights would definitely do it again in a heartbeat",
          "I love good sightseeing spots but this cable car did not give that to me. Yes, you are above the city but there is nothing to do once you get up there. I do not recommend this at all.",
          "There was nobody waiting after 12. Not sure if this is a regular thing or not. When you get to the top there is a rather overpriced restaurant. The views were good though. The best bit was the war museum. Nobody should visit a place without learning about the past, not so",
          "Somewhat pricey 5 minute ride, but worth it for the views over Dubrovnik Old Town. You'll regret it if you don't do it.",
          "The view is amazing. A bit pricey, but happy that I did it anyway. Be sure to walk around to the various viewpoints.",
          "I heard the cable car had been down for a long time so I felt pretty lucky it was open when I visited in mid-August. There was a really long line but the cable car comes about every four minutes so it moved pretty fast. The cost was 170kn roundtrip for an adult and I took it up",
          "A short, easy trip to the top. But the ride is steep, so you arrive very high up. The view is magnificent! It's also educational, being able to pick out the features of Dubrovnik and put everything into perspective. You also have the option of eating/drinking at the",
          "Loved this. Something a little different...... views were amazing!! It\u2019s definitely worth checking out. Queue can be a bit long so time it well.",
          "Great view from the top but buy your ticket in advance. You can see the nearest islands, you look down in the old town and can see the mountains for miles too. There was a long queue at the bottom cablecar station and everyone with pre-purchased tickets were given priority.",
          "This works out to be just over \u00a322 for a return trip that takes a little less than 5 mins to reach the top. The views there are impressive and there is a lovely restaurant at the top but that too is overpriced ( over \u00a36 for a soft drink). Queues for the cable car are also long",
          "We have spend the last 3 week touring a number of cities in Croatia and I can honestly say Dubrovnik has been one of the most expensive...following game of thrones everything has been highly commercialised and as such is very over priced! Return entry for a cable car was",
          "Touristy this to do when in Dubrovnik. Views were nice from the top. We went up in the evening because that's when we could fit it into our schedules. Once you are at the top I recommend going to see the castle that will provide a good history of the conflict that occurred in",
          "We were sold ticket in basis of 10min wait...when reaching queue it reflected more than an hour so we asked for a refund and came away!",
          "I went up with the cable cart and had a magnificent view on top of Dubrovnik. I went at night, in which Old Town is lit by light which gives you a good look of how beautiful old town is with its townwalls. At the top you have a restaurant (you need to reserve at forehand,",
          "The cable car is a fantastic way to get some of the best views of the city. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to the top of the hill and you are rewarded at the top. At the top, there are a couple of restaurants primarily serving food but depending on the time of day you might also",
          "We probably got our tickets (there at the station) around 5:30 which beat the crowd for the most part. Easy ride up and easy ride down. Gift shop in the building my BF bought a red checker flag shirt...and realized he got two juniors large vs men. They quickly/easily let him",
          "After enjoying the city at ground level it is worth taking the cable car. The station is only a short walk from the city gate (uphill) and the cable cars are frequent. Once at the top there are some great views from different level terraces, restaurants and even an ethnic",
          "We this was done on our last day, and I am glad we waited. We could see all the areas we covered from the top. Our walk from the hotel really stood out, in distance, once we saw it from above. Visit the museum if you can - an eye opening experience as well.",
          "Costs around 22 euro return for literally 3-4 minutes each way. Great views but there's no shortage of views around Dubrovnik. That said if you combine with the panorama restaurant then it becomes a worthwhile venture. One of those attractions you'll do once to see it but",
          "It was baking hot on the day we went up. We found the airconditioned cafe serving cakes and drinks a perfect resting point. Good views.",
          "It's a pricy, but it's the fastest way to go up to the mountain with amazing wiev not only to the town, but further. it's great night and day. There is also very good museum up there about what happened in Dubrovnik in 1990ties.",
          "Provides a good view of the old city but the trick is when at the top to walk away from the cable car and take pictures further away from the cable car otherwise your photos capture the cable in the photos.",
          "The views from the top of the cable car were stunning! It is worth timing your visit to sun set, although you will have the longest wait if you do this. It\u2019s also worth looking into the restaurant at the top for dining with a view!",
          "Great view of old Dubrovnik, not a cheap ride to the top, but great views and easy to pay and ride. There is a shop at the top, plus a place to eat and take in the views",
          "This is one of the things on the bucket list as a tourist. However the view was fantastic and I got a very good Tuna sallad. Service on the resturant was a bit slow",
          "The views of Dubrovnik from the top of where the cable car stopped we absolutely stunning and you could see for miles. There was also a restaurant at the top, if required, and facilities for 4-wheel drives and a zip wire experience",
          "We went after sunset up with the cable car to avoid the big crowds. Everything was smooth and organised. This all comes for a non-Croatian price and \u20ac22,50 euro for a short ride that brings you to a view and bar. In my opinion a discount or a package deal with a ticket (\u20ac30) on",
          "When we look for a high place, we are looking for good views and excellent pictures. In this case, the system was ill-designed and the cables are in front of you, between the old town of Dubrovnik and your place to take photos. You need to be really inventive to get a place",
          "Well maintained clean and organized. It was a little bit expensive and the cables don\u2019t allow you to get nice pictures while you are on board. Otherwise every thing was perfect. On the top you can have a great view over dubrovnik and the neighboring islands. The sunset was a",
          "Worth the trip to see panoramic views of Dubrovnik. Stop at the restaurant for a drink. The waiters are very attentive, in the evening giving you blankets and setting up heaters",
          "Definitely worth while to take the 3 minute cable car up to the top so you can overlook the Old Town and the Adriatic Sea. There are activities to do once at the top, as well as a restaurant. We didn\u2019t do more than take some photos and enjoy the view.",
          "Incredible cable car trip to the top of the mountain over looking Dubrovnik old town. Fabulous views of the surrounding area. Lovely restaurant at the top to sit and eat/drink and take in the amazing views. Good museum at the top with the history of the 1990\u2019s wars and the",
          "Well worth a trip on this cable just to get views of the city, it\u2019s so beautiful. There is a fee to pay to get on the cable car, there is a shop and restaurant at the top.",
          "I recommend to you to go there early at the morning. We were there when they oppenned the service. So you can get later a good place on the top if you want to seat in a good place and to apreciate the view.",
          "Great view from the top of Dubrovnik, at the top restaurant where you can eat or just have a drink, gift shop, and area with cross. 25 euros per adult return on the cable car.",
          "An alternative point of view from above. Getting to the top point with your car might be challenging. Two less challenging alternatives: park in the parking lot near the lower point and stand in a long line to buy a ticket for round ride up and down or take a taxi to the upper",
          "\u20ac25 per person for a 5min cable car trip is a bit expensive but so is Dubrovnik in general. Having said that the view is incredible and if your a game of thrones fan it has to be seen. Nothing worth seeing once your up there it's really all about the view",
          "A beautiful view over the City!! Travelled to Croatia in 2017 and thoroughly enjoyed what I saw!! What an amazing city, did a few tours whilst there!!",
          "Only worth doing for view and what appeared to be decent restaurant. Noticed some left queue for taxi and was tempted only that I had bought ticket",
          "Restaurant seemed decent and busy but other than that doubt I would bother except for a panoramic photo",
          "You can take a taxi up for less than the price for one person on the cable car. If we hadn\u2019t prepaid for tickets, we would have taken one of the several taxis that were begging for business. With dinner reservations at Panorama, we waited over half an hour to get on the cable",
          "The cable car is quick and smooth which was important for me as I hate heights. It's clean inside but abit hot in the summer although you won't be on it long enough for it to be a problem. We took this cable car to the top and then walked all the way down the mountain which we",
          "The cable car was modern and clean, though not air conditioned. It is['expensive for what is a short distance. There was a 20 minute wait to get tickets and board because the ticket booth was closed in the middle of the day for some reason. Siesta?",
          "This is a very well run attraction and despite being afraid of heights I really enjoyed the ride and the amazing views of the old city. Clean facility and the opportunity to go to the old fort/ war museum as well that was a very sad but interesting place to walk round. We",
          "The queues were quite long for this trip as the cable car has limited capacity of about 12. We waited for almost an hour to get on. There is a wait of about 10 minutes between cars - so 72 people per hour. The views were great over the old town and as we went in the afternoon,",
          "Hands down I would recommend using the cable cars to get a glorious view of sunset over Dubrovnik. There may be a line when you arrive, but it moves fairly quickly (10-15 mins). The cable car ride is pretty quick and rather crowded, but do not despair as the views from the hill",
          "Stunning views on the cable car ride up to Mt Srd which is about a 3 minute ride. Try not to blink so you dont miss anything. However we as a family of 4, fairly fit individuals decided to walk back down. Was not signposted at all which was disappointing. Only after enquiring at",
          "I recommend doing this by the end of the day, maybe the late afternoon. It is an appropriated point to get superb pictures. Do not miss the opportunity. There is a sophisticated restaurant to profit the views by sipping a drink or having a sunset meal.",
          "The views are spectacular but the lines were slow moving especially in the blazing afternoon heat as there is only two cable cars. Once at the top there is a restaurant, gift shop, a bathroom and an upper and lower level to enjoy the view from different perspectives. We spent",
          "Whilst the views are spectacular, for us it was the war museum that moved us the most. A very illuminating account of a war we remember, but were too young at the time to fully appreciate. The cable car queue moved fairly promptly, but was fairly expensive considering how short",
          "When you visit Dubrovnik, it will not be complete without experiencing this cable car. From the Top you get the best sunset plus the beautiful view of the Old town. The restaurant there is a bit pricey and make sure you go during sunset.",
          "A must do in Dubrovnik for a beautiful view. Like everything else in the old town on the expensive side. Well organised and only a 5 minute queue wait.",
          "A round trip on the cable car costs 170 Kuna. For that you get a 3 minute ride to the viewing platform then queue for 30 minutes to come back down. While you get fantastic views from the top, virtually all photos will be spoilt by the cable car pylon and/or cables. There seems",
          "Make sure you book a table at the excellent Panorama Restaurant at the top to make this 170kn return trip worthwhile. Great views at the top, and there's an interesting museum about the siege of Dubrovnik there, too.",
          "Rather quick service, and got to the top quickly and seen amazing views however the prices for the bars and restaurants at the top were extortionate",
          "This trip was better than we imagined. Bit of a walk to cable car to start with. We were fortunate that when we arrived at 5.30 PM there was NO QUEUE at all. We therefore got the perfect view as we as ended , very lucky. The view at the top was outstanding in all directions. The",
          "We went up the cable cars mid after noon on a very hot day. The queue did not take long. 300kn for the two of us. It was well worth the money, the views are fantastic, right across Dubrovnik and all along the coastline. Our only regret is that we didnt book into the restaurant",
          "Took the cable car to view the sunset and it was absolutely beautiful. The view of the old city are the best you will find and if you want a real treat then eat in the restaurant at the top! Would make a memorable occasion.",
          "You can buy the tickets beforehand at local stores. This avoids the additional queue at the entry point you have to stand in for buying tickets. View is fabulous and worth the trek!",
          "Amazing views of the old and new town. Make sure you take time to eat in the restaurant at the top! We avoided the question by going after 11 and bought our tickets at the venue. Ride is only about a minute.",
          "Worth it. Best timing is for the sunset. A few tips: (1) buy ticket at one of the official sellers just a stairs down from the old down, you save the queue for tickets (2) find a place on the top of the hill behind the cable car station, near to the trail, that best place for",
          "great experience, if you want to have a drink at the top make sure you book the table, if not very busy...",
          "Well worth the trip and visit to the restaurant at the top. Not cheap but great views and relatively peaceful away from the throng of tourists in Dubrovnik old town",
          "We went up in the afternoon and it was not as busy as I was expecting, no queues just straight in and the views are the best in the city! Well worth it!",
          "I would highly recommend going before sunest, we arrived for the cable car about 6pm and waited for about 20 minutes in the queue. No need to pay in advance as you can purchase your tickets just before you board! They don\u2019t cram too many people in which is good but it did feel",
          "About 24-26\u20ac for two trips of 2 minutes each, the view was nice but absolutely not worth the price, one of the most ridiculously overpriced things I have ever seen. It was an absolute harsh mistake, totally regretful about having done this.",
          "At over \u20ac25 pp return it is expensive considering it was only around \u20ac10 pp return 2 years ago! I understand there is a maintenance upkeep cost but surly with the hundreds if not thousands visiting every day you could reduce costs, just seems a little much even for Dubrovnik.",
          "I first did this journey on the old cable car pre war in 1976. I loved it and it was the highlight of my trip. Usually when you do something again many years later it\u2019s a disappointment .... this wasn\u2019t . The new cable car is really lovely and has good windows for viewing but",
          "The service is good, and you are best off to buy the tickets before. Otherwise you must line up twice, once for the ticket and once to enter the cable car.",
          "This is a trip worth taking, stunning views and fascinating historical interest. We bought single tickets to travel up to the summit and really enjoyed the trek down in the late afternoon. The museum gives a good insight of the war and how the old town was defended. You can",
          "It\u2019s an attraction of Dubrovnik so felt we needed to do it . The views were excellent but think the 400 kuna for 2 adults and 1 child was expensive You get discount with your 1,3 or 7 day Dubrovnik card but we forgot ours So remember yours !!!!!!",
          "you get some spectacular views of old town and the ocean with the island of lokrum in the photo as well! it\u2019s a tad pricey for the cable car, especially because it\u2019s literally like a minute up and down. but the views do make up for it. there\u2019s a restaurant up top as well to eat",
          "Without any doubt, if you want a perfect sightseeing spot in Dubrovnik use Cable Car to take you to the top of Mount Srd. The ride is just a few minutes long and pleasant. The price is 150Kn in both directions, but if you are in decent shape you can use one of the hiking trails",
          "This was strongly and repeatedly recommended to us literally by everyone who visited this city as well as the tour guide and even the taxi driver. Most people suggested we take the ride around sun set time so we did, in fact, it suddenly became extremely crowded and the queues",
          "Great trip and brilliant view of the city etc.... Restaurant excellent value but book book book before going there. If u book via trip advisor you will have go across the road to get your ticket printed.",
          "Well worth doing. It was to hot to walk the walls so the cable cars was a brilliant way to see the old town and it really is spectacular from the top. Lots of steps to get to the location so be aware of that.",
          "We took the cable car up the hill and walked back down. The view from the top is worth paying to go up, but I'd recommend walking down if you have the time. The walk down also has great views. Walking up would be a hard slog but we saw plenty of people doing it! It's better to",
          "My family and I visited Dubrovnik and I wanted to do the cable car ride at night. We were not disappointed. The view was stunning! We booked the ride through trip advisor the day before as we heard it can be very busy. We got there at around half past 8 at night and it was very",
          "Very quick ride, very expencieve, the view can de seen from other places as well! Anyway, it was interesting!(if I remember correctly 160euros per adult, 60 per child -12).",
          "The place was easily assessable. At the top there is a lovely souvenir shop and a restaurant where you can grab a bite and drinks whilst overlooking at Dubrovnik below. They have some activities for adrenaline junkies like buggy adventures and zip line (which I didn\u2019t try). I",
          "This was best experience ever! You see Dubrovnik from above, plus we Had coffe in amazing panorama bar on top!",
          "Wonderful way to see Dubrovnik. Leave the Old town turn right walking up the hill. Eventually you will come to a few corner shops and a passage which goes under the road. You can buy a ticket here or there are a couple more at the cable car entrance. Most stand on the cable car",
          "Fantastic experience, well worth the cost. Recommend book at Panorama (can do via cable car website) to get a reservation on the glass balastrade.",
          "Great fun and the views were amazing from the car and the top was stunning. Really enjoyed ourselves on this trip.",
          "An important touristy goal while in Dubrovnik. Definitely take advantage of seeing the city from such a great perspective. I'd suggest going earlier in the day to get great lighting on the photos of the city, before the sun casts a harsh light.",
          "By far the most expensive couple of minutes cable car ride I have ever taken. Really hiking prices to cash in on Game of Thrones and Cruise Ships",
          "The view from the top was amazing but cable car was pricey. Fun to do if you have some time and can hike down.",
          "If you're visiting Dubrovnik Old town this is a must. Even if just for the views alone. Just for good measure there is a lovely restaurant at the top. S Cable car staff, friendly & helpful.",
          "Well worth the 170HKN. If you want to see the sunset I would buy your ticket in advance as the queues are quite long in peak season. Aim to get there about 40 mins before sunset to allow you time to get up. You don't have to join the massive queue but go to the left hand side",
          "Fantastic view of the old town but expensive for what it was. There was a bit of a queue but it did move relatively quickly",
          "I took advantage of the combo ticket they had on offer at the ticket office - 255 HRK for two return trips (one during the day and one at night after 8.30pm). This is a discount of about 30% on two separate return tickets. It was a bit pricey but the views from the top were",
          "We took the cable car to get a great view of old town of Dubrovnik. Fantastic views and a fantastic experience. Would recommend you buy tickets on way in as opposed to before you arrive as they had to close for lightening one of the days. Great experience and very safe!",
          "We did the cable car ride both during the day and again on another evening. The ride itself doesn\u2019t take long, it is well worth doing for the lovely views at the top. You can walk around and there is a museum about the bombing of Dubrovnik just a short walk away. There is also a",
          "The ride costs 170Kn which if there is a family of you can get a tad pricey. The actual ride is a couple of minutes long and bizarrely you are never far from the floor if that makes sense! The views are fantastic when you get up the top of Dubrovnik but that\u2019s it it\u2019s a view.",
          "It\u2019s not the cable car but the view when you reach the top. There\u2019s nothing special about the cable car per se, but, like other reviewers, I highly recommend going up a little bit before sunset and enjoying the sun setting over the Adriatic. I was a little panicky because",
          "Wow this was worth every penny. We went up at around 7pm and watched the sunset. It was awesome. Then we went to the war museum which is also worth a visit, Take your hanky as some of the stories are heartbreaking and it is unthinkable that this happened in recent times",
          "The cable car is a great piece of engineering and one of Dubrovnik\u2019s highlights. Quite a high fare (200 kn per adult) for a few minutes ride but walking up (there is a well marked trail) will be a bit of a challenge in the mid-day sun. I should have checked the price for a",
          "Choosing the cable car ride was a decision that we were very happy with as it\u2019s not only beautiful to see the city from above but the restaurant at the top is incredible with beautiful food and drink. Wonderful trip.",
          "Fantastic views but very expensive. The restaurant was busy at the top and our 6 year old loved the buzzer to call the waiter.",
          "The queue for the cable car is long (both up and return!) be sure to get your tickets from trusted vendors. It is possible to buy tickets at the cable car (cards accepted here), but sometimes the queue is longer. The journey is short, and lots of people all have to go in one",
          "Myself and my boyfriend were on our way to use the cable car leaving from mlini - bus to Dubrovnik costs 40 kuna and the cable car costs 170 kuna each for 4 minutes. However Tom the taxi driver offered to take us to Dubrovnik and stop off at 3 of the best views of Dubrovnik",
          "We felt that the cable cart trip was very expensive for what it was. Yes the views were fantastic but for the price you pay for your ticket combined with drinks/food at the top it works out quite expensive for a relatively short trip. We done the city walls and felt the views",
          "If you go to dubrunik a must is the cable car ride go up before sunset and watch it set over old town and the bay from the bar up top it is amazing \ud83d\ude09 then ride down when its dark to experience old town all lit up . Give your self plenty of time to go down as the queue can be",
          "Took a taxi up and cable car back down to the old town. Wonderful scenic view as well as having a drink or dinner in the restaurant/bar. Service is a bit so so and the waiters are a bit out there but overall good place to visit.",
          "It\u2019s worth every penny to take this tour. The view of the old town and ocean is very beautiful. Although it\u2019s a long wait in line up but it\u2019s totallyworth it. A",
          "This was the best way to see Dubrovnik and the surrounding area and the sea. Start off with this so you get the overall view of the area.",
          "Personally I feel the cost is too expensive for that you experience. Tickets cost 170 kuna (\u20ac22.50) and can be bought from little shops in Old Town or at the entrance to the cable cars. If you are visiting during peak hours of the day I would recommend having your ticket before",
          "Arrived at the entrance at about 10:30, bought our tickets from a pleasant assistant and went straight onto the cable car. There is a machine that tells you how many spaces there are left on boarding, so it should be quite easy to see how long the wait should be. Car was full,",
          "Not keep in cable cars but I took the plunge. You need to buy the tickets 170 kuna pp. in one of the little outlets on the way to starting point which is beside fire station at the back of the old city. Queue was very long but moving as car takes 30 at a time. Only a short ride.",
          "The cable car itself, along with the staff are all great. The views are ok but there are other free vantage points where you can get the same perspective. My gripe is with the 170 kuna round trip, per person fee. This is more expensive than a round trip ferry to Lokrum island,",

          "The views from the top of the hill when you get out of the cable car are amazing and is well worth a look. The only thing is that when you're in the actual cable car, it's very full and the best view is definitely at the front, so if you aren't stood there it isn't as good until",
          "Cars are not jam packed, plenty of room to move while travelling up and down. We went in the morning and I am sure it would be much busier later on in the day. Lovely views from the top, well worth the visit.",

          "This is a lovely way to get a birds eye view of the city. It isn't a cheap activity but it is something to tick off the list when visiting. The views from the top are wonderful although I would say they are slightly obstructed by the cable lines so it is hard to get good photo",

          "Well worth a visit. Views are stunning, food in the restaurant was lovely and the museum is definitely worth the extra cost to understand the modern history.",
          "Once up the mountain, view is very good. The cable car is a 2 minute ride uphill or downhill. Only issue was that it was rather over priced for what it was (roughly 11 Euros for an adult one way).",
          "We went early ( before 10.30am) to avoid the queues and the 3 of us had front of the car views. There are only 28 places in the two cars that run so you can understand how it can get busy later on. At the top there is a shop toilets and restaurant. Also if you walk round there",
          "Great experience and once at the top you are rewarded with gorgeous views of Dubrovnik and surrounding areas. Expensive to getup there but cheaper than the rip off taxi prices. Would recommend the dune buggy safari trip but take change of clothes as you get very dirty.",
          "We took the Cable Car up the mountain about 7pm and we saw fantastic views as the sun was setting. Would have liked to dined at the restaurant but vegetarian option was lacking. Price of cable car was quite expensive given how quickly you reach the top but views made up for it.",
          "Expensive, short ride but the views from the top are fabulous. There is a fair chance that if you arrive towards the end of the queue you may be squished in the middle of the cable car unable to see the views. Best to go later or earlier in the day to avoid crowds.",
          "A relic of the communist era upgraded with new equipment. It\u2019s an amazing view from the top but not worth the return ride. If your up for a bit of a down hill walk, you can walk back stopping at Konrbra Dubrava which is a lovely restaurant in a small village with some odd",
          "Took the cable car to the top of the city. Too expensive as took about 4 minutes but became money well spent with fantastic views and a breathtaking sunset which we watched for over an hour while eating a picnic. Maybe an alternative, ie walking or taxi would be preferable.",

          "If you\u2019re in fairly decent shape, hiking up the hill (about a 1000 ft climb) is the best way to see the countryside from various elevations. (We are 60-year olds in excellent shape.) Take plenty of water, and treat yourself to a drink or meal in the restaurant at the top. Great",
          "we wanted to experience the cable car. it looked a good trip and it was, but unless you had booked the restaurant at the top once you had experienced the fantastic view there was nothing else to do. It was a very expensive trip for a view.",
          "We managed (entirely by chance - this kind of thing dies my happen to us..) to turn up on national Celebration Day and do this was ridiculously cheap, but even at twice the full price it would have been stunning. The views are amazing, the museum at the top is really interesting",
          "We took our children on the cable cars at around 7.30pm. We didn\u2019t have to wait long for tickets or cable car and got up in daylight with sun setting not long afterwards. Fantastic views and kids really enjoyed it. Nice to do an activity away from the heat of the day too.",
          "we had option of climbing walls of the city or taking cable car. cable car was a no brainer. the views were georegous. on the land side of hill, we were surprised to see random cows grazing the mountain side. i found it well worth the cost, which i think was around 20-25 euros.",
          "We headed up to the Cable Car at approximately 715pm...and thankfully we bought tickets from an agent on the way (there are a number along the steps as you head up to cable car from Old Town). When we arrived there was a long line of people, but as we had tickets we hot straight",

          "We took the cable car to get to the restaurant Panorama, I find the 170 kunas to go up and down quite a lot. The view is nice, not so much worth in the evening when it get dark, the city is illuminated but not so great. Consider waiting time to go down, as many people are using",

          "So it's a three minute ride with a normal ski-lift. And it costs about EUR80 for a family of four, should you be lucky enough to have younger kids, that is. Otherwise it will be about EUR100. If you are in a somewhat good condition, take the walking path up, it is great and",

          "There are no doubts that a view of Dubrovnic old town from the upper gondola station at Fort Imperial hill is just amazing. However,there is a new (and free) competition to this ride. It is a \"recently\" completed a viewpoint platform in road D8 (Jadranska cesta). At this",
          "Incredible views of Dubrovnik, Lokrum and beyond. The restaurant is excellent too with quality food and service !",
          "Going up the cable car you get an excellent view of the city, the ride takes about 4 mins going up. At the top their is a gift shop and two restaurants with someone making old coins. The restaurants are more expensive that down in the town",
          "A bit awkward to find but after asking a few locals we got there, watch for the one way traffic though as the roads are quite narrow. The cable car ride was well worth it, there is a lovely indoor/outdoor restaurant which unfortunately we didn't have time to visit as we were",
          "Great view from the top but ... As everything in Dubrovnik : to expensive ,the tourist is a milkcow and that is a pitty",
          "Safe and organized, waited in line for a few minutes. A bit expensive but best view of Dubrovnik- breathtaking",

          "We used the cable car to go up to the restaurant. It is expensive but the views are spectacular, and the other options are car or a very long walk. We bought tickets on arrival but then had a 30min queue in the real heat of the day. There wasnt much shade. The queue went",
          "A bit of a must-do when visiting Dubrovnik and the novelty of the cable car makes it an \u2018experience\u2019. The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking but consider ordering an Uber to get you up there for a fraction of the cost.",
          "The overview of Old Town Dubrovnik is spectacular,well worth taking the cable car up,priced at around \u00a320, it's a fairly new system.Though there isn't a massive lot of things to do, there is a pleasant restaurant/bar, shop and viewing areas, but a bit crowded",
          "Went to Dubrovnik with a friend and tried the cable car. Indeed the view of the entire old town is spectacular up there but there are not much more to do up there. Hiking down maybe is a good activity but we did not do it coz we did not wear comfortable footwear. The cable car",

          "You can always choose to walk up and/or down the hill to avoid the \u00a325 price tag. It was a hot day when we did plus we were short on time. The views are pretty special. You should visit the War Museum too whilst up there. The bar is super expensive so I wouldn't bother.",
          "Great view but the experience is overrated because I consider 170 kunas to be a lot for a 4 minute ride... Worth noting the queue was about 30mins. We were recommended to take the cable car to catch the sun set, except once up there, sun sets on the wrong side. If the price",
          "It was a bit pricey, definitely a novelty thing to do while you're there. You can always get a taxi up and walk down for a lot less. If you do get the cable car up don't stop at the viewing platforms, walk out the back turn left and keep walking past the fort and the car park.",
          "A must-do if you\u2019re spending a few days in Dubrovnik. Great views and a wonderful history lesson about the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian war of independent in the 90s, if you visit the museum at the top. The cable car journey lasts just a few minutes, but is worth",
          "One of the major tourist things to do in Dubrovnik. It's overpriced in my opinion. We bought the tickets at the gate because I was running out of Kunas, needed to use credit card. There are number of outlets along the way as you walk up to the cable car station that also sells",
          "Went on a Friday night just before sunset. Although a large queue, this moved quickly (don't be taken in by the taxi drivers who try to convince you to go with them and not do cable car). Views from the top are stunning; well worth it",

          "Wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d manage this, heights aren\u2019t my thing, but for the views it is such a worthwhile activity. Very little exertion is required unlike walking the city walls, and in 4 mins you are at your destination. Stunning views of the old town and the Adriatic.",
          "Hmmm, build a cable car, and make a viewing area behind the cable car station meaning all the cables are in view of any photo/view. The fact that half the people here scrambled down the hill side just to get a decent view says everything!Whoever designed this is a moron. They",

          "The views from the cable car are exquisite, the facilities all good. However, 170 kuna per person seemed steep for me. There is a road up there so it would probably be much cheaper just getting a taxi to see the views (especially if there are 4 of you)",
          "We went up the cable car on our second day and had to pay over 40 pound just for two of us to go up and down. The view was amazing but there isn't much up there apart from an extortionate restaurant, can't even get a cheap drink. For the price and the time you actually spend up",

          "The cable car was a great way to overlook the city and sea. There is a restaurant at the top of the hill with outdoor seating to enjoy the view. FYI: We went early in the morning when the cable car opened with the intentions of getting \u2026",
          "Glad we did it, but also glad we didn\u2019t stand in the line at the bottom. A taxi driver (Mario) offered to drive us to the top and stop for pictures on the way up. It was well worth the money (not that much) to do this so we didn\u2019t have to \u2026",
          "Ploce Gate entrance to Old Town.",
          "Must visit, unique view of Dubrovnik with Elaphity islands!",
          "Large variety of plants and flowers. We like the aquatic centre and always buy items for our tropical fish tank. Good selection of gifts and at Christmas beautiful Christmas decorations. We also like visiting the Palms restaurant.",
          "The most amazing views from the cable car.  At the top there is an exhibition in the old fortress storytelling the yugoslavian civil war for just a few pounds entry fee.",
          "Nice view, but take a cab to the top and save your money...Dubrovnik will take plenty of your cash anyway!",
          "Awesome views of the Dubrovnik from the top. It's a quick five minute ride to the top, where the Panorama restaurant is located. There is also a small gift shop up there. The cars can get get very packed, so it's a bit tough to get pictures on the way up or down.",
          "spectacular view from top of cable car building.  going down was just as spectacular!",
          "Amazing view of the sunset at the top. Cashier was extremely rude.\n\nI recommend you buy a one way ticket up to the top and walk down - you can always buy a return ticket at the top if you change your mind.",
          "You have much better o\u00f1and cheaper options to reach the top of the mount, it is true the view it's amazing but you can just pay one way to take some nice pictures and ask for an \u00fcber to go down. Also the cable service it's just until 5 so you can't even see the sunset there",
          "Breath taking place especially if you walk up the steps. Canoe trip amazing. Cable car is a rip off.",
          "Hard to find from the old Town but just keep following the signs up the concrete stairs.\nAmazing views as you ascend and remember to  climb the stairs to the observation platform above the exit landing",
          "Dubrovnik and the old town centre very nice to visit and also worth taking a ride in the cable car with spectacular views",
          "Cool place, two orange cable cars bring you up and down to see Dubrovnik from the mountain top. It moves very fast. Approximately in 5 minutes you'll be on top. Do a video there or try multiple shots features on your camera during the ride. On top there are a shop, a restaurant and few places to witness the great view.",
          "Great way to get a good view over Dubrovnik. Was a short queue to get up there for sunset (which was beautiful). The cable car was not overly cramped  so you could see out. A worthwhile trip. There are also restaurants at the top.",
          "You can see beautiful panoramic views of the city below. You must not miss the sight. I think the panorama looks especially beautiful at sunset.",
          "It is closed during February. It js better to check before you go there",
          "The views are fantastic and the staff friendly. We didn't have to queue on a Sunday in peak season. However it is a very short ride (under 5 minutes) and the cost is very high just over \u00a342 for two people ( July 2019). If money is tight you might want to prioritize other attractions.",
          "The price is reasonable, but on busy days the wait is outrageous. I understand they can only go as fast as they can load, unload and go.  But if it is busy be prepared to wait. Plan to leave early if you have to catch your boat!!",
          "Great way to see the city. Good value. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Very good, but 25 in the car at a time. Very hot and difficult to get a good veiw. The best part is when you are at the top. The viewing areas are amazing. My advice is take a taxi to the top and do the same thing. But much cheaper",
          "Definitely worth the ride up, it\u2019s quieter in the morning, when the light is better for taking photos over the old city.\nMake sure you walk across to the cross, as the best views are from there.\nIt\u2019s worth a look into the museum around the \u2026",
          "View on the city is nice. \nBut - something is missing, nothing to do...",
          "This is definately a must do in Dubrovnik. Well worth it as the views are unmatched once on top of the hill. Queues can be long, and expect the usual pushing and pulling plus body odours when confined in a small space with a big group of people, but for the 90 odd seconds that the trip takes, not too much of an issue.",
          "The best views over Dubrovnik and you get a little cooler in the heat of the day up on the mountain! Capture panoramic views over the whole coastline, the whole of the old town, etc... Great way to spend a couple of hours. Drinks, etc are \u2026",
          "Great view. Not much to do at the top besides enjoy the view and go to the Panorama restaurant. There did appear to be an off road buggy tour available also, I didn't try that.",
          "Even though there seem to be a fairly long que, it was actually moving fast because the cars are running what seems to be every 7 minutes? Breathtaking views from the top. Great experience.",
          "Fairly expensive. A taxi will get you there for less and on it's way you will experience even prettier view of the city. There are some popular stops for taking photos along the way which drivers will show you.",
          "A great place for taking panorama photos of Dubrovnik old town. Here you can find a nice restaurant with a great view over the city and of the black mountain. The ride with the cable car is smooth and doesn't take long (arund 3 minutes).",
          "Well, in all my lifetime so far, wife and i have never been in a cable car. It was good fun.\nAnd great views.",
          "Took the cable car up and back today.  There was a pretty long line around 2-2:30PM we waited around 40 minutes to go up.  We bought our tickets a few blocks away but apparently you can buy tickets at the front of the line.  It was very \u2026",
          "Overpriced for what you get at $25usd a ticket for round trip. Buy the ticket before you get in line (ticket office is at the front of the line, wait until you get close and just jump over to the window, then back in line, or have one \u2026",
          "Amazing view and would definitely reccomened it to anyone looking to get some great pictures of the old town and coast. Only downside I would say was the price, 175 kuna a little bit expensive. We went up just before sunset and went back \u2026",
          "Really expensive considering it's only a couple of minutes ride. Took an uber drive from the hotel to the top and it was half of the price. The cable car was overly busy and couldn't get a good view either.",
          "Offers incredible views of Dubrovnik and the surrounding areas. And it's a fantastic way to view the beautiful Aegean sunset on a lovely sunny day, too.",
          "In my opinion a DONT MISS on any visit to Dubrovnik. Smooth ride and stunning views. Not however  ideal if limited in mobility",
          "Do it. Its very nice and takes u out of the city.\n\nYou can see the full view of the old town. Very beautiful.",
          "incredible view and stuning sunset :)",
          "Worth the trip. Go early. Great view of the city. Be sure to visit the fort and exhibit of the war",
          "Nice views of Dubrovnik. Really short ride for the money. Roughly 5 minutes. And there's nothing to do on top except for a few gift shops and a restaurant",
          "Definitely worth a trip to get the best views of The city. Book dinner at the restaurant on the terrace for some awesome food and chilled out dinning. Waiters are lovely,  views spectacular.",
          "Had to queue, but the view from the top is amazing! Well worth it",
          "Beautiful as you go up, especially in the evening during sunset!",
          "The queue to go up can get very long and you can be waiting for quite some time. This can be a bit miserable as it can get quite hot.\nThe ride is good and the views are great when you get up there. There is a lovely long restaurant up there. I didn't eat there but it did look lovely.",
          "Very convenient instead of a climb plus a beautiful view!",
          "The cable car ride is much quicker than expected and because it was so busy I got stuck in the middle of the cable car in amongst a group on a tour. I am short so literally could only see people's backs and chests going up, on the way back I did manage to get by the window for a look!",
          "So got to do this when in Dubrovnik, only takes a few minutes to reach the top so be quick taking your photos, the views are very rewarding especially just before sunset. Then sit back and admire the views over Dubrovnik and beyond",
          "Awesome way to get to the top of the mountain for view of the coast and Old Town Dubrovnik. The cable car ride only takes 4 minutes. Do not let the cab drivers hanging around the cable car convince you to drive you to the top. The views from the cable car are SO worth it!",
          "Beutiful vieuws",
          "Not worth the money. It takes a short time to get up there, once up there the view is somehow limited by the cable of the cable Car. But it's the price that made me this picky about the ride. Up there one is limited in choice in restaurant \u2026",
          "The view from the top is fantastic. However, the price for this cable car is too much. It is cheaper to get a taxi and free to walk. I highly recommend the view, but you can do better than this (long line too!).",
          "Lovely views! We went to see the sunset and it was amazing. Make sure you go early enough to get a good spot!",
          "This onr you should try if you are in Dubrovnik.. On the top of the mountain you will entire city, breathtaking views, amazing landscapes... You will enjoy it",
          "This is ridiculous. The price you have to pay to get on the cable cars is way too much seeing that they won\u2019t even bother placing a shaded spot for the people waiting in line. Not for the whole line anyways. On top of that it says nowhere \u2026",
          "Pricey ticket for getting  to a spot where you can take some great pictures of the old town or enjoy good, but expensive lunch.  If a picture is what you are after,  I recommend this during hot months, but on cooler days you can see similar if not better views from the free hiking trail. Hike can be a bit tough on hot days.",
          "the views are fantastic!  A must visit!",
          "It was a nice little trip to the hill from where a beautiful Dubrovnik can be seen. You can also buy tickets for the war museum that's on the hill. Students get 50% discount on the museum entrance fee. I think this is a must do thing in Dubrovnik. The views from the top are worth it. Enjoy!!",
          "Fabulous food and cocktails stunning paramount features and views it's a must to do top sight seeing",
          "Wonderful views, as travelling up & down. Very popular and therefore busy with long queue.",
          "Only a few minutes to wait before getting the cable car up to the top of the mountain and you have great views over the city and the surrounding area. There's a few different observation areas to give you different angles.",
          "There were beautiful views, once on the top, 25 people squashed in like sardines, no air con, the ride only last 4 mins. Would recommend taking a taxi to the top, and they stop at places along the route and explain the scenery. Museum at the top in old Fort, you can pay extra for. Cable car doesn't run on windy days.",
          "My recommendation is as follows: Get the cable car up have lunch and a thirst quenching ale at Panarama restaurant. Hike down well worth the time as the views are phenomenal.  MT Srd is a very thought provoking place on many levels. The cool relief of the pine tree cover near the end will be savoured.",
          "Don't take the cable car but climb the hill by the well marked trail path. It's a physically demanding walk above all when it's hot but you'll benefit of spectacular views on the old and new towns.",
          "Its May 2019 this place is closed. Locals tell me its due to a dispute between the corporation that owns the cable car and the Dubrovnik Council. Legend has it that the company haven't paid some kind of taxes and owe Dubrovnik town a load \u2026",
          "Pretty cool! I'm sure if they would cut the price, they would have more people willing to pay. Think about this ;)",
          "Not well organised re booking tickets (we bought our tickets online) but still had to queue and got to the cashier to get our tickets. So a complete waste of time booking your tickets online. The ride up and down only takes minutes and the \u2026",
          "Fantastic views of old city and lovely cafe/restaraunt at the top",
          "A bit pricey, able to get a panoramic view of the Old City but luck wasn't on my side, the weather was a bit foggy.",
          "25euros pp, while you could also drive there... there is a beautiful scene but not worth 50euro for us. Only go up there if you are planning to take some time and eat/drink at the restaurant",
          "Expensive for the service provided but well... It's something you do once in a lifetime. The view is amazing!",
          "I would say it was too expensive for what it was. We didn\u2019t get the restaurant at the top because who knows how much more that was going to be. The views were astounding. Facing the old city, you can see the islands and orange tops of the \u2026",
          "Quick to get tickets and jump in. Reasonable price. View amazing. You could walk up if you're brave but it's wild brush and very steep. Tourist shop at top. Long wait for car back down.",
          "it's worth to ride it. you will enjoy grand view.",
          "Great views of the entire city but is very very crowded with tourists. Will take one hour + of waiting in line to access the cable car. Top of the cable car is crowded with people of all types taking photos.",
          "An awesome view of the old town and surrounding area. Great restaurants as well with dope views!",
          "Another unforgettable experience, love the city, culture, food, wine, priceless views. People are not too friendly. Definitely use Uber, Taxis will over charge. Expect a lot of walking.",
          "Very good. Worth it to travel on this cable car. Very new. High standard of maintenance.",
          "Fantastic views over the city and surrounding areas.",
          "The view was good. Windows were clean. It moves every 10 minutes which is great. But it was a little crowded. Up to 30 people sometimes.",
          "\u00a321 per person is a bit on the expensive side, saying that it does give you quick access to some stunning views. Buy your tickets at the cable car if you want to pay by card, otherwise it's cash only. Unless eating at the top restaurants, \u2026",
          "The cable car journey itself is quite expensive for such a short-ride, and the photo opportunities on the way up and down are limited. But for the view at the top it's all worth it.\n\nRather than taking your pictures at the platform \u2026",
          "Good ride.  Good views.  Reasonable line when we arrived early in the day.",
          "Amazing experience , the view of the entire city is a short ride.",
          "Great views of Dubrovnik to include Old Town.  It is a bit pricey and The best views of Old Town are obstructed by the cables (where the opposite side of the platform would have offered a better view).  Bit in all, it was a great experience.",
          "Make sure you do this when you visit Dubrovnik. \nYou get the most amazing views when you get to the top. In busy season yes it will be a long que, we waited around 45 minutes but this is so worth the wait. We went for sunset and started queuing about a hour before and at least that time I would recommend.",
          "Beautiful view! If you want to eat at the restaurant on top of the mountain, make a reservation beforehand. We got lucky and were able to get on a list and were seated but best to make a reservation.",
          "We walked up for the sunset and cable car'd it back down great place to visit a fantastic holiday cheers Croatia",
          "Took the walk up Mount Srd and decided to take the cable car back. Seemed to be very busy while we were there but its fast and feels modern.",
          "Overpriced for a less then 5min trip. Only take it if you want the fantastic views at the top and not the journey. Check out an uber ride too they are usually cheaper and you can enjoy the ride up.",
          "Got the cable car up and decided to walk down. Lovely views from the top and a nice restaurant and museum but at 200 kn per person I'd walk up next time.",
          "I loved Dubrovnik but the cable car is shut down and had been for some months due to an issue with unpaid tax payments \nAnd so we had to find a taxi to take us the top of the mountain for six people and then take his number in order to \u2026",
          "Amazing views of the city walls from the top. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Awesome views of the old town. There is a public toilet, cafe and restaurant at the terminus.  We took the cable car at 9:30am so the waiting time is less than 5 minutes, but it looked busy later in the day.",
          "Great views and experience.  Fun to check out. Great views too. Dont miss it. Well worth seeking out",
          "What an expensive ride! 170 Kuna for round trip but all worth it!",
          "In the morning it can be very busy with lot of groups from the cruisie ships,but the view from Sr\u0111 mountain is one of the greatest along the entire Croatian coastal area",
          "There's some great views of the mountains beyond and a cool lil un-legit sunset spot in front of the bar/restaurant (worst kept secret-so it seemed!) Took a while to queue as a massive coach/cruise tour in front of us, but worth the wait",
          "Very scenic ride if not very short,well worth the effort and to sit overlooking Dubrovnik whilst eating lunch was such a beautiful thing to do..",
          "Price is high but worth it... \nParking is free on the up station, so it is better to drive there and leave the car - In this way instead of spend money at parking in the centre you can spend some more, but with enjoy the view and ride.",
          "Nice overview, but it was really short trip. But it is still worth to get there to see the city from that point. There was huge queue and the price was a bit expensive. 4 of us could get there by uber and it would be cheaper. Some people were hiking down the hill as they took only one way ticket.",
          "The price for cable car is so expensive. I recommend to take cab or mini van and take a ride to the top of the hill. Panorama tour is the best option!",
          "Absolutely fantastic views, didn't realise Dubrovnik is so big, if you get a chance please go on the cable car as it is so worth it...such a beautiful place...bear in mind loads of steps everywhere...",
          "must visit place if one loves a birds eye view of the beautiful city , the landscape and the Sea touching the sky.",
          "This is a must. The view from here is breath taking especially as the sun is setting.",
          "What a panorama up there!\nThe station is a little outside of the city walls \nOnly 3-4min to arrive at the top.\nGreat views and bar/restaurant overlooking the bay.",
          "Great views of Dubrovnik from the top.  East, fast ride to the top. Tip: buy tickets at kiosk to skip long wait lines.",
          "The view once you are up there is amazing and the Panorama resteraunt is one of the best in Dubrovnik but the cable car is very pricey for a 3 minute ride, we got an Uber  up there for less than \u00a38 which was half the price of the ticket to come down on the cable car.",
          "Well worth a visit, it takes about 5 minutes to ascend to the top. The view from the top is amazing, you can see down the coast as far as Cavtat and old and new Dubrovnik.",
          "Excellent views. No wait for the cable car. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Wheelchair accessible.",
          "Worthwhile to enjoy the good restaurant at the top or for the view of the walled city but not sure I would say it's a must unless going to restaurant",
          "View at the top of the hill is great but the cable car itself is overpriced and only lasts 2 minutes. The cable car down cost double of what it cost us in a taxi direct from our hotel in lapad up to the top of the hill.",
          "Very impressive views of the whole city: we'll worth the money.",
          "If you re looking for the best view of Dubrovnik old town, the cable car could be the best choice",
          "The price was a little high, but the view from the top makes it worth it. On a warm summer day in Dubrovnik, taking a ride to the top and getting some fresh air and wind was perfect. There is a souvenirshop and restaurant at the top.",
          "Wonderful to spend morning hours, the best time to go early and spend couple of hours.",
          "Beautiful scenery on the top of the mountain, cable car was a bit crowded in August days, full of tourists.  Expensive ride but worth to go.",
          "Wasn't waiting too long to get on. Price was reasonable. Return trip ticket.",
          "Definitely worth the queue going up",
          "This is quite an expensive cable car compared to other cities with cable cars, plus it is actually a very short journey - less than 5 mins each way. It also costs \u20ac20 per person so if there is a group of you it is cheaper to hire a taxi at \u20ac20 each way. Views are absolutely stunning but slightly obscured by the cable car structure.",
          "Worth trying.  Brilliant views .",
          "Cable car not running. They had dispute with the government over tax payments. We got there and no running cable car. No staff there or anything.  People keep saying it will be opening but no one says when. No sign outside it to say \u2026",
          "The view from up there is amazing, but the food at the top is really expensive, so bring your own food.",
          "Amazing views! Totally worth the wait. Not a lot up top except for views, food, and a short zip line. But those views are amazing!",
          "The cable car is a good alternative for those who do not have a car or do not have enough time but I highly recommend driving or walking up towards the vantage point because \nA: it's cheaper. 170 kn for a 5 minute shirt tide \nB. You can avoid the queue\n\nThe entrance to the road up to the mountain is on a highway",
          "In summer there will be very Long Queue to go up to see sunset. Every 10min is one trip and  it could carry 31 People at a time.\n\nSuggestion, if you are happened to wait in a Long Queue , then take a taxi to go up and come back with cable \u2026",
          "Quite expensive for 5 min ride in comparison with other cities. View is nice ,but then in cabin no A/C and you are sweating like a pig. For the price they charge they should invest more.  Do not have a lunch upstairs it is ridiculously overpriced.",
          "Worth it for the view, but kind of steep $$$. Save some money by hiking back down if able.",
          "Worth doing on a nice day in Dubrovnik. Excellent views and a nice breeze on a hot day.",
          "Brilliant! Well worth a trip up in the cable car lovely view from the top! Cafeteria for refreshment as well!",
          "Excellent views of the city's  and the mountains \nA very smooth ride",

          "Best views of Pile and the restaurant was amazing. A solid 5 stars.",
          "Great view of Dubrovnik. Restaurant at the top. Make sure you visit the museum at the top. Buy you ticket in the town as you then don't need to quque at the ticket office at the cable car.",
          "I would say this is must for anyone visiting Dubrovnik- great views over the whole area",
          "Amazing views great food a little more expensive than other places but still good value will certainly return.",
          "Don't miss the museum in the Fortress next to the top of the cable car. It's dedicated to the siege of Dubrovnik and is absolutely fascinating. Even my two teenagers were engaged by it.",
          "Good veiw but not much else, overpriced restaurant, bit exspencive for the ticket for a 3 minute ride.",
          "The view is spectacular, but packed with tourist groups who cut in line. While you up on the hill, check out exhibition about the Croatian war",
          "Truly amazing. A must do when in Dubrovnik!! We caught it just at sunset and the line was very long! So leave some time for a que. So worth it!",
          "Don\u2019t take in high season. Line is long. Just cab it\u2019s cheaper and more convenient.",
          "Expensive 4 mins ride to the top.\nBeautiful views of Dubrovnik Old Town.\nThe restaurant at the top is a rip-off.. A Tuna Salad baguette costs an eye watering 120 KN !! Unbelievable!!\n\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude23\ud83e\udd2a",
          "If you want some great pictures of dubrovnik,go too the top of the cable car & walk to the top & round the corner of the building,fantastic high views",
          "Great views, and for those physically challenged, a great way to the top. Stand in back for good views.",
          "What a ride and it's a must. You cant go there and not do this. It's really brilliant. The reason for my score is the charge. Why do you put of so many tourists with this very expensive charge. Its 350kr per a person and they dont take \u2026",
          "Expensive @ 25\u20ac . Maybe try a taxi to the top next time. Excellent view! Or save yourself the money and see my pics \ud83e\udd2a",
          "Great view. Lovely sunset. Sadly the perfect view is blocked from the cables.",
          "Dubrovnik is a tourist hotspot so few things are cheap. A return journey by cable car is about \u00a320 but great views from the top are breathtaking with a really good restaurant, it can be very busy though",
          "Enjoyed the ride but expensive for <5minutes. Very view of the Old Town from the top. Quality shop for souvenirs and jewelries. Restaurant too.",
          "Too expensive for a ride in croatia. I wd 100% recommend the walking path or a cab. A taxi cost us only 70 Hrk for 3 person to bring us up. Table car cost 90 for oneway and 170 kn for return for only one person.",
          "You don't have to wait long for a cable car. It's a smooth ride with great views!",
          "You just have to take a trip to Dubrovnik castle the views are spectacular only a 20 min boat trip from mlini hotel",
          "A nice place to see the old Town from above. The cable car tour takes only a minute to the top. Not over crowded inside the cable car when we took it.",
          "Good but expensive. Wish people would remember that they have eyes that are connected to a brain that should be able to remember things you don\u2019t need to take photos of everything!! One or two maybe, but literally in the cable car with paparazzi! Use your eyes!!!",
          "Expensive but if you have a reservation at Panorama - nothing is more convenient! You do get Ubers for a cheaper price to go there but not to return.",
          "Fantastic views sunset is a must. Great value for what you see.",
          "Worth doing have your lunch and a few beers looking over Dubrovnik and the Adriatic sea enjoy",
          "If you plan to visit Dubrovnik please consider doing the cable car ride just amazing views from the top",
          "Fast, clean and efficient service. Views from the top of the hill are only matched by those from a boat on the sea.\n\nThere's a caffeteria and souvenir shop, but expect to pay extra for anything up there.",
          "Awesome views of Dubrovnik and sea. A must see when in the area.",
          "Great views of the old town, sunset and a very informative museum about the homeland war.",
          "Wonderful view, but too expensive. Hiking there is worth it",
          "A remarkable view of the Old Town and the island of Lokrum - not to be missed. The sunset is magnificient.",
          "A bit expensive. Was closed because of thunderstorm. But, you can take Uber to go to the top. And if you are more than 3 person, Uber is much cheaper than cable car.",
          "Not long and overpriced. Very busy and with  long queues going back down. I recommend taking a taxi to the top.",
          "Tremendous views of dubrovnik bit of a cue to get on not so bad coming back down plenty to do and see when up there",
          "Couldn't redeem the pre bought tickets from the official website the weekend I visited, due to strong winds the cable car was not running. They won't give a refund. Another ripoff company, unfortunately like many in Croatia.",
          "One of the must do's of Dubrovnik. Nice cafe at the top. And you can't get some great photos at the top",
          "Amazing views at the top but the price was steeper than the ascent!",
          "Amazing views! An absolute must when visiting Dubrovnik",
          "Spectacular views and fascinating museum of the homeland war.",
          "The cable car is big and it takes many people inside. That way you can't enjoy the view... Only if you are one of the firsts to get in.",
          "Fantastic views but need to walk up a lot of steps to get to it.",
          "Amazing place,  what a view.  Lovely restaurant at the top. Great history to the place.",
          "If the speed of the wind exceeds the safety threshold on any part of the cable car route, the cable car will stop until the wind speed reduces.\nIn the case of possible lightning, the cable car will temporarily cease operations !!!",
          "Beautiful view at the top, smooth ride in the car up and down. Other services available by third parties behind the upper structure.",
          "We went up at sunset and had to wait in line for at least 20 minutes. The experience is only worth it if you do it at sunset, because it is extremely expensive (25 euros / person), but then the landscape is really special.",
          "You feel like you are on top of the world ... fantastic views from the top a must do in Dubrovnik",
          "In my opinion at 27\u20ac round trip it's not worth it. Absurd line to come back. Probably as quick to walk back down. And cheaper up in a cab if you are a group for sure.",
          "Beautiful view over dubrovnik. Lovely walk down the hillside. Friendly staff.",
          "!!!BEWARE OF SCAMMERS!!!\nVery nice view, especially during sunset, cabin goes every 5 mins so don\u2019t get scared by seemingly long queue. We started about 50m long queue and boarded in about 15 mins. Also beware of scammers (drivers) standing \u2026",
          "Excellent views overlooking the city.",
          "The lookout terrace is quite windy, but the panorama to the city is wonderful! After sunset everybody wanted to come down so the queue was a little long.",
          "I would rate it 3,only because of the value for money. 2 min ride with an ok view, for 20e? Not my kind of a thing. You can rather take a taxi for 40e (around that price, you can try and bargain) to take 4 of you up and down, and ask him to stop on a way up for a view point that is amazing!",
          "Amazing view of Dubrovnik.  There is a great little gift shop at the top of the hill.  It is a must do activity when in Dubrovnik.",
          "Take the cable car for the most amazing views of Dubrovnik old town,  when their enjoy a beer on the terrace and take takeaway moment to think how terrifying it must have been to be in Dubrovnik during the siege.",
          "Great view from the top, but needs a better viewing platform to get sunset photos!",
          "Well worth the time to go up. Going up to both see the sunset and dubrovnik by dark is recommended.",
          "The cable car itself is fine but the management of queuing for access is poor. Health and safety issues at the top with loose barriers and people walking around the barriers to the cliff edge needs improving.",
          "I think the fee is a little expensive, but the view from higher position is priceless!\nYou can enjoy meal or drink at the top of the restaurants, and it seems you can enjoy an attraction using buggies.",
          "A must when visiting this beautiful country amazing views fab for photos came with a tour guide as touring via a cruise holiday she was fab with all her history knowledge for us tourists!",
          "Very short ride up, very spectacular views. We'll worth going. \ud83d\ude01",
          "A bit of rain and the cable car is put out of service. Recommend hiking up, much better views along the way!",
          "Lovely views, good museum of the war. Expensive food and drink.",
          "Very quick up to the top. Great views. We went early and not to busy.",
          "Not running while I was there May 2019. The story goes they hadn\u2019t paid their taxes so Council shut them down. You can still walk up the hill if you want to see the view.",
          "Beed a proper queuing system, went this morning nice views but chaos in queues ir lack of organising queues!!",
          "Looooong lines at sundown. Definitely worth it. Over priced. Take a cab down, find people to share it with. Wayyyyy cheaper! Take it up (if you want) the point is the view at the top not the ride up.",
          "Rather pricey but views ate amazing!",
          "The cost for the cable car is more expensive than I would have expected, when you're at the top there is not too much to do, however the view is wonderful.\n\nOverall I would recommend this to people that can't manage to do the walk up and down the available path.",
          "Game of Thrones fans, a must. Amazing views from the top of the cable car.",
          "It's ok it has good views but not worth the price",
          "It was a great experience - the panoramic view of the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia.\n\nEnsure you go in day time and when sun is not much shining as reflection might block lot of view.",
          "Stunning views from up there. Up in two minutes, a bit pricy though. If you have a car, you can drive up the hill yourself.",
          "During our visit was cable car out of order. There was no warning on website or Facebook. Just one paper on entry.",
          "Totally worth it if you are in town! The views were spectacular!",
          "Beautiful way to see the most beautiful sunsets",
          "Beautiful view of a beautiful old town!         It's like going back in time when u walk there",
          "Despite being expensive, the view is totally worth it. You can buy tickets at a few shops around the cable car, but the official ticket office is the only place that accepts both cash and credit cards. If you plan on seeing the sunset, \u2026",
          "Great views from the top, check it's running though as it had been closed for weeks last time we went (June 2019)",
          "Amazing city for lunch shopping and culture it\u2019s where Game of Thrones is filmed.",
          "Lovely views and there's a war museum you can visit",
          "Good view from the top but probably better to walk up",
          "Wonderful panoramic view!",
          "Long line in the heat and no real guidance on were to go to get the good views, but the views are spectacular.",
          "The view to see the the sunset is completely blocked, and only visible from the cars... Ridiculous.",
          "Touristy, but pretty cool to see Dubrovnik from above.",
          "Good ride up and down Mt Srd. Visit the museum at the top relating to the Homeland War.",
          "The view is great but the price is not",
          "If you want a grandstand view of Dubrovnik, climb up the Mount Sr\u0111 overlooking the city. Mount Sr\u0111 (412m) above Dubrovnik dominates the landscape. You will have the best view of the city from there so climb up and see the Imperial Fort buill during the Napoleonic period in 1806 and a white cross erected in 1935",
          "Great experience to see the city of Dubrovnik from the top and enjoy the cable car going up and down",
          "It's a closed cabin, approx 20-25 ppl, trip time is just few minutes, steep elevation. Take into account if you wnat to catch dusk and spectacular views be at lower station 30-40 min in advance since queue may be long and you'll be proposed \u2026",
          "Nice and easy ride.  A bit too expensive or we might have used it a few times to go up and get a drink or eat at the Panorama Restaurant.",
          "Nice place to visit for a sunset..\nBird eye view of the city..\nIn 4 mins we are on the top..\n\nCan also access by road if you don't wish to pay 25\u20ac / 170 Kuna per person",

          "Breath taking view of the old town and hills",

          "The views form the top are incredible but the cable car ride itself is a bit cramped! The tickets are 170kn each for a return (approx \u00a321).",
          "Beautifull wiew!",
          "Wow great fun, such spectacular view, we took loads of pictures. Very clean and spacious, with a specific number of people allow to get in.",
          "Lovely views, driving up saved quite a bit of money. Don't miss it",
          "We hiked and took our time to watch the city. Beautiful hike, beautiful city",
          "Takes you to the greatest view of the old city, plus, a chance yo learn a great deal about the conflict of the 90s which brought Croatia to its knees.",
          "Great view, would have been 5 stars if the price was lower.",
          "If you go to Dubrovnik taking a trip up the hill be the cable car is a must. Suggest late afternoon or before sunset. See and take picture before, during and after sunset",
          "Amazing views and access to the war museum memorial",
          "Great way to see the city spread out below and much of the surroundings.  Nice, quick trip up the mountain side with good viewing areas in all directions.  Also gift shop and restaurant.",
          "In about three minutes the cable car takes you from the lower station just north of the city walls to the top of Mount Srd. During the ride, you can see the old town, Lokrum island, the coastline of Dalmatia an the beautiful Adriatic Sea. \u2026",
          "The views from the top of the mountain are terrific. What I don't like is the price: 170 kunas !!! 25 \u20ac  They are stealing you with a smile.",
          "Excellent view from above..recommended for everyone to do...",
          "Great service,nice view on city from hill,great spot for pictures at sunset",
          "It was amazing to see the Wall and sunset from the top",
          "Be prepared to join a massive queue in order to go up. Once there, you need to join another big queue, in order to come down. There is not much to do at the top, other than to look down. However, the view of the long coastline and the walls and rooftops of old Dubrovnik more than compensates for the price paid and all the waiting.",
          "Spendy, but a smooth ride too a wonderful view",
          "Fantastic views and absolutely gorgeous. A much do if you are visiting Dubrovnik",
          "Amazing view from above! \nThe starting point is a bit hidden, no signs along the way.",

          "Nice views over there and nothing negative to report. Don't forget to buy two tickets.",
          "Good food served at the restraunt....",
          "It\u2019s OK. It gets you to the top and there are great views. The snag is that it can be busy and you may need to queue, particularly if tour parties jump the line with their pre-booked tickets. The recommendation is to use the cable to get to the top and then walk down (assuming you have strong shoes).",
          "Nice, but nothing spectacular, I think it doesn't worth to wait so much, all that people...",
          "Expensive but well worth a visit, very informative museum.In a place where actual history occurred.",
          "Worth the trip up for the view. Easy walk down.",
          "Short but well worth the wonder view from top",
          "The price is very high but the sunset with the person you love it's priceless \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude01",

          "Great place to enjoy the views of Dubrovnik. Get there to see sunset view.",
          "The view of the Duvbronik from the top of the moutain is awesome! I strongly recommend that you try this when you come to Duvbronik. There are also zip-line and Buggy activity on the top as well.",
          "Beautifull viene. Worth its value",
          "It is nice to get over there and have some pics with panorama view of Dubrovnik Old City. \n\nUse to be very crowded with a lot of waiting time to get up and down. The skybar isn't special at one. \n\nWe'll try next time to walk up there and not to use the cable car, which cost 170kn for around trip.",
          "You have to go to see the amazing views.",
          "Great views, you are able to walk up to the fort or use the cable car",

          "Amazing view from the top. We took one way up and came walking down on the return it was perfect.",
          "Lovely views from the top, nice restaurant at the top too, just be mindful when it's busy you may not get space to sit outside. Food was great - bit pricey but then its a tourist attraction site, so expected. Best to plan your visit \u2026",
          "Very quick journey to the top - the views of Old Dubrovnik are amazing",
          "Nice view, but very expensive for a short trip. A slight relief from the heat at sea level. No air-con in the gondolas.",
          "Please you are not going on Moon...you are going on 500 m big hill...and price is like you are going on...Mars...to to big money for 5 minut drive..  and view which is reachable by car",
          "Most breathtaking view in Dubrovnik! Were there at sunset.",
          "Cable Cars working as they should, good View, however, quite some Trash laying around. Possible to walk up and down but very hot",
          "Take no.17 bus! It gives you more beautiful view",
          "Little pricey tickets but travel is very comfortable and views are superb. Queue can be long but it shorten very fast. If you have time and stamina then you can avoid this attraction and walk to top of mountain, but for elders and children I think it is best option as you can easily travel even with wheelchair.",
          "Worth the trip for the views and the interesting museum.",
          "Totally advertise to visit the peak, astonishing, breath-taking views.",
          "Bought our tickets in kiosk before queuing for cable car and were called by assistant to front of queue saving at least one hour. At the top the view was amazing.

          "A must do if you want to se a great view over Dubrovnik City!",
          "The idea is cool but the city close it because it's a private company and the city doesn't have one cent for it. Please make it change!!!",
          "If the lines are long, you still won't wait very much to get on.\n\nThe views are lovely, and not just of the Old Town! Once you get to the top, you can get a great view of the mountain ranges and the water that's a hundred shades of blue.\n\nThere's things you're expecting from Dubrovnik - make this one of them. Recommended.",
          "It is really cool.",
          "Perfect place to see the whole City.",
          "Nice views, but other places in city have better value for money. There is notuch to do when up, and even photos of city get cables in the middle.",
          "Great view from the top, but much too expensive",
          "We loved it \ud83d\ude01",
          "It was reopened on 29th June Saturday!\nThe view from the top absolutely values more than HRK170 or \u00a320 for return ticket.",
          "If has beautiful views from the top.",
          "Nice view from the top. Shame the lady at checkout looks like she hates her job and hates visitors too.",
          "Lovely views..but we were waiting ages to board cablecar not knowing we were in a line of people with no tickets (we had them!) Noone to say we didnt have to queue we could have went directly to cablecar\ud83d\ude32",
          "Had a great experience in Dubrovnik, there were beautiful views at the top of the cable car, especially being a game of thrones fan.",
          "This is a must when visiting Dubrovnik. The view you get here is breathtaking. However, be prepared to stand inside a small space with other tourists. We went around 17:00 and the line moved relatively quick, the sun just made it feel like \u2026",
          "Beautiful views! Line (queue) was 1 hour long.",
          "A bit of a challenge if you're afraid of heights, but it was a lot of fun.\nSomewhat disappointing if you don't get to look out the window.",
          "Fantastic experience and views, well worth it.",
          "Great overlooking view on  old town and neighbor area",

          "Good view but that is about it. Can hike or drive up here.",
          "Long wait for this, but spectacular views, especially if you time the rides well and take in night time Dubrovnik or a nice sunset. The top also has a really interesting museum about the attacks on Dubrovnik and its resistance fighters. Right behind the main cable car building, directly under the radio tower.",
          "It was good. Amazing views. More seats in the cable car would be an idea. My elderly father was left standing, mostly down to other people's manners. \nHad lunch at the top. Didn't get the best view but the steak sandwich was great.",
          "The views were fantastic.",
          "Panoramic views. Worth waiting in the queue.",
          "Very expensive and crowded great view from the top but for \u20ac75 for three of us it was too much",
          "The view from the cable car is amazing! However it is a really short ride. Tickets can be purchased as the cable car site and a few other select retailers.  I would actually recommend purchasing them early so you're ready to go as soon as you get there.",
          "Great views from the top and a lovely restaurant too",
          "Beautiful views, and a hype for GOT fans\nYou see some of the filming sights!",
          "Overrated. Go there by car tour instead. They will also take you to the bridge and to a viewing spot on the mountain that is much higher up and much more beautiful",
          "Absolutely staggered to find the cable car closed as taxes not paid. Fantastic Uber driver took us to the top (19kn) and called the closure an embarrassment! The museum in the fort at the top is excellent!\nBeware, should you decide to do \u2026",
          "Worth it for the views from the top. And good food at the caf\u00e9 up on the hill.",

          "Amazing views. Must do",
          "Amazing experience. The staff worked efficienctly and the cabin was clean and the views were superb!\n\nThe observation deck was excellent. The elevator was out of service so those with issues with stairs beware.",
          "Disaster!! \nStanding in queue which was moving very slow we were asked to step a side for 2 tourists bus with 50 tourists each(minimum) to go first in queue!!!!! \nWhat a bad unprofessional management!!! \nI don't recommend it; instead you can drive up the mountain there is several viewing decks",
          "Beautiful view from top of mount Srd",
          "Round trip ticket per person 170 kn. There are two add-on experiences can be bundled at the top of the hill like visiting  1991 war photo exhibition  (60 kn per person) and buggy adventure.",
          "The cost is 170 kuna per adult, but it worths to climb. The scene from their is really beautiful.",
          "Beautiful place, gorgeus views of the city!!!",
          "A little steep (pardon the pun) price wise, but worth it for the stunning view",
          "The view is gorgeous, we stopped for lunch at the cafe which is a little expensive but worth it",
          "Massive queues on certain dates/times. Sometimes overcrowded. Fast up/ down. Nice views but since u move fast and sometimes the car is busy u might not be able to enjoy the views. A bit pricey for what it is.",
          "An easy way to get to the top of Mt Srd and see Dubrovnik spread out below you as well as the views up and down the coast , quick tip go early after opening or late afternoon after the ferry hordes are gone as the queues are massive at the \u2026",
          "The views from the top are stunning, there is not too much to do at the top a souvenir shop, two restaurants and a zip line. The ride is 20eur round trip and takes less than 3 mins, there is also a track if you prefer to walk that looks \u2026",
          "Awesome views on the way up and way down. Cool panoramic bar at the top. Only takes 3:30 minutes to get to the top. We thought the cable car was going to be super packed and not ventilated. It was just the opposite. Good amount of room and air vents all throughout overhead and a few at the front and back as well.",
          "Loved this experience. Fantastic views.  Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Best view you'll get. Expensive tho.",
          "This is the shortest cable car ride I've ever done but you will get the best view of Dubrovnik from the top. We went in the middle of August and there was no queue! Probably not as expensive as you would think either!  Highly recommended.",
          "Great views. Friendly staff.",
          "Great view over the old town",
          "Was closed at the time as they had a dispute with the local authorities or something. Got an uber up and walked down instead.",
          "Great experience for photo opportunities. Cost was 150 kunas and tickets are sold at the same price across Old Town. Note that there is a time limit to visit the area or else you will have to buy another ticket or walk back down. The \u2026",
          "It looks nice but it's not working at the moment",
          "On the way downwards, the employee Miho took the Japanese tourist group before 10 people who have already scanned the tickets. It was an unpleasant experience. I have asked him for a reason to let the Japanese group in first, the answer was \"wait for the next one\". Therefore a great one-star for you, Miho!",
          "Q was long but sunset was spectacular",
          "Extremely expensive. If you have 40 min to spare walk at least one of the ways, the views are even better",
          "Unfortunately cable car wasn't working and we didn't want to walk or get a taxi over there. Instead we walk close to hotel belvadere (abandoned) to be able to have a nice view and take pictures. I got a tip about park Ursula for a nice view of dubrovinick old town and lokrum Ireland but br aware is a long walk uphill.",
          "Beautiful views. Hard to find from where i started could easily walk past where to get tickets on way up and alot did. Line was packed when i got there 30mins later it was 10 times worse. July very hot no shade for pedestrians and busy road \u2026",
          "The views are amazing up there!",
          "Tickets are expensive. It's more interesting to go into the old city for a walk.",
          "Using this car you could see a big view of Dubrovnik City. What a wonderful world there.\nI see calm Balkan sea with a combination of castle that still in a great condition.\nHigher perspective give you a meaningful understanding about a nature beauty.\n\nYa Allah, please give me a chance to come back to this city with my family.",

          "Brilliant trip if not a bit pricey on food and drink when there but a must on a trip to dubrovnik",
          "Brilliant , great veiw ,at the top there is a cafe , museum , quad biking",
          "Fun entairtainment to get uphill by Dubrovnik cable car. However, it is too expensive, around 21 eur per person both directions. Ofcourse, one can choose to climb down or use other ways of transport. Smart guys look for other ways getting \u2026",
          "Great views of a magnificent city.",
          "Ride lasts about 10 Mins. Well managed. Sometimes queue for ticket are longer than actual entry queue, so check which queue you are joining. View from top is good, and different from even the topmost point inside the old town. You can see \u2026",
          "If you have more than one person in your group, it's actually cheaper to get an Uber to the top of the mountain.",
          "Very expensive for spending 10 minutes at the top, views were very cool though",
          "Great views and the War Museum is humbling",
          "A beautiful view of the old town\nWe enjoyed the short but impressive ride up and down the cable car. The views are magnificent and allows you to see the size and scope of the old town. There is also a very nice restaurant at the top.",
          "Fantastic ride, you see the whole city .Great Sunset and night views.",
          "A little pricy but great views of Dubrovnik",
          "Started working from 29 June 2019 again!\nThe view was amazing and it is worth to try :)",
          "Amazing views...recommended..",
          "It was a long day, without you my friend. And i will tell you all about it when i see you again",

          "Fast easy lines great views",
          "Fast and easy access to the top of the mountain. But very expensive for 3 min ride, seems also that the price is just going up, year after year. Just wonder, what is the top price and when tourists will say, now it is enough?\nAt the top of the mountain make sure to see the sun go down - the best ever view in my life",
          "Unfair the cable car was not working and we were told by a local it had been out of action for quite a while. But were told to use if o  a return trip as views were something.",
          "Would recommend going with the cable car. Excellent view from the top and one can have a drink or romantic meal at the restaurant there. Avoid the long queue by going at around 16:00 in the afternoon. Gets busy before sunset again.",
          "Don't go in the taxi.  Wait in the queue. It doesn't take very long at all.  Great vistas and enjoyed food in the restaurant at the top.",
          "Very nice view from the hilltop.",

          "Can get busy pre buy tickets before lining up go straight to the front",
          "Amazing view. Tickets are not cheap though",
          "TOURIST TRAP!\nThey sell the tickets far away from the cable car station so that you cannot see the long waiting line, that can take up anywhere from 30 mins to 1h.\nI recommend visitors hike up there if they can (free) or take a taxi or bus, for the same price as a cable car ticket.",
          "The view is quite pretty, but the 170 kuna is a bit more than seems fair.",
          "Modern cable cars with excellent views of Dubrovnik. Worth having a meal at the top. Cars were frequent enough at the beginning of May and we walked straight on at the bottom with a wait of just a few minutes at the top.",
          "Well run operation, feels safe and unparalleled views over Dubrovnik and the Adriatic Sea.",
          "Was closed at the beginning of May. \n\nBe careful walking up because some of the google maps directions will lead you to a highway that is impossible to walk alongside of.",
          "Quiet expensive considering cab/Uber is cheaper to get up mountain but worth the views",
          "Good service. Incredible view from the top. Can get busy so don\u2019t be surprised to see a line. Friendly staff",
          "Great views, but could have been better. Lacking in good places to sit and chill out with the city and mountains as a backdrop. At 150KN per person, a bit steep.",
          "Ok.",
          "Opening times vary and seem to depend on expected demand. Expensive for 4 minutes but offers superb views over the old city and the mountainous views around. Early start recommended as the viewing platform can get very crowded after several \u2026",
          "Was really fun with a great view!",
          "Worth it! \nGreat views of Dubrovnik and you can stay up the mountain as long as you like.\nYou can descend the mountain with the car car or by foot there are paths.",
          "Flawless rental and very good service when we got problems",
          "Go to the cable car to get tickets, small queue, well worth doing. From the top views are amazing. Also a good display of the war, explaining the effects of the invasion. Places to eat available.",
          "The cable car is an easy way to get to a vantage point to view the old town of Dubrovnik. There are many people who have got tickets already before queuing for the cable car. The queue is actually for getting on the cable car - so if you \u2026",
          "Not the cheapest at 150kn but good views from the top. It's worth buying a ticket in advance so you have less queuing time and there's not much at the top apart from some nice views so we were down in about an hour",
          "Safe and fast way to come on the mountain srd\u017e, 426 m the highest point of dubrovnik.",
          "Okay cable car, but very expensive. You can just walk to the top as well.",
          "Well worth going up and seeing Dubrovnik from up a height",
          "Very short, beautiful view of oldtown. Expensive at 160 kuna each for a 1 minute ride. It was closed for the 1st week we were there as they do not own the land they are on and had not paid the govt rent. The locals were all saying thay it may end up being permantly closed so get there soon.",
          "Views from the top are breathtaking.",
          "gets up fast. overpriced.",
          "Quick, clean and good views.......can be a little cramped with tourists (like me :-P)",
          "It is not easy to a park near the old downtown. It is not reasonable price for a parking.",
          "Splendid view on Old city of Dubrovnik",
          "Helpful staff, came to tell us during dinner that service is due to finish early because of growing wind and checked if we're ok to carry on with new schedule, great service!",
          "Overrated - line is too long going up and down and the view is over crowded with people and if you do get a good view it\u2019s ruined with the cable lighting. Would have much rather we spent my money at a restaurant looking at a beautiful view. It\u2019s a shame really",

          "Very quick and affordable for a beautiful view",
          "Unbelievable, incredible views. Sunset was class",

          "The view of Dubrovnik is amazing. Though at 170 KN for a roundtrip, it feels a bit pricey.",
          "Was really nervous.about the cable car, but it was fantastic. Very smooth and very fast - only 4 minutes to the top. There is is a moment when it crosses the tower that you feel your stomach lurch slightly and the car rocks, but it passes \u2026",
          "Alert alert alert!!!! There is no cable car I. Dubrovnik anymore. The cable car has been shutdown due to some technical and administrative issues and will remain closed on near future too. There is no plan for it to resume service recently \u2026",
          "Overrated, the round-trip costs 25 \u20ac ( 30 $ ) and there\u2019s absolutely nothing to do.",
          "To have a good view you must jump the fence and go to some rocks near the border.\nAlmost the all open area is occupied by a restaurant, besides this, the post that supports the cable the was installed in the middle of the view to old town. \u2026",
          "Very quick and reasonably priced.",
          "A good trip with great views",

          "Great views of the city and surrounds",
          "A little bit expensive for a fast cable car! The view on the top is amazing with restaurants, but, expensive. You could visit as well a museum of 1991 war and learn more about that time with various items used at that situation! I recommend go during the sunset to get a very nice pictures with a marvellous landscape!!!",
          "Wasnt running due disputes.",
          "Nice but crazy expensive",

          "The ski lift experience will probably depend on the month of the year, or about the crowd. In July and August, driving takes a bit of a wait and a short walk to the cabin, but a real pleasure follows when you go down to the upper station and you have a magnificent view of Dubrovnik, Lokrum and Elafiti islands.",
          "Expensive for what you actually get. Better spend time and money on something else.",
          "It's very short but you do get fantastic views of the city. I would recommend getting the one way ticket and walking down as you see so much more that way and there are some nice art installations depicting the Stations of the Cross. Be aware that start of the path down is badly signposted and it isn't a smooth path.",
          "Fun trip up the cable car to the top of the mountain behind Dubrovnik.  Amazing Vistas. Go for sundown and the city lights",
          "Overpriced considering 30 minute waits at both ends\nGreat views though!",
          "Can skip this, much better walking instead of waiting",
          "Seems a lil expensive but the views are gorgeous. Wish they didn't put the photo deck directly in front of the cables.",
          "Amazing views from the top of the mountain. 150 kuna per person for a return journey is too expensive considering there is only a restaurant and bar at the top.\n\nBe aware of the long queue before/after sunset as this is a busy time to go, \u2026",
          "Wasnt open when we were in Dubrovnik because of some debate about paying land fees or taxes. Highly disappointed.",
          "We visited off peak season so it was very easy to just hop on without any queues. The views from the top are amazing! I'd imagine in peak season you would need to queue for some time. It's quite expensive. At the top there is a nice \u2026",
          "While the views from top are fantastic we felt ripped for 150 kuna each for the round trip. I would suggest a taxi ride at 1/2 the price would be a better option. Felt gouged by the price for what is there.",
          "Breathtaking views",
          "Great views from the top (obviously). Cars can get quite cramped so don\u2019t expect a panoramic view as you ascend/descend. Worth going up just to experience Fort Srd.",
          "Good view but overpriced",
          "Cable car had stopped operation when we visited. That was a disappointment. Hopefully the disagreement between the owner and the city will get resolved so the car can continue operation soon.",

          "Great experience, perfectly organized.",
          "We got lucky with a short line and were able to get the bottom of the car so had the best views of the town. The cable car was a bit pricey (150kuna per person round trip), and there's not much to do at top besides get a better view of the city.",
          "A cable car that takes you from the city of Dubrovnik to the top of the neighboring mountain. A museum of the war and a beautiful restaurant with a beautiful view. You get to see the whole city of Dubrovnik with its rampart and red roofs. Not to be missed.",
          "Loved this, if at the top, and you can't get a table in the open air restaurant, tables are plentiful in the indoors restaurant, with great views",
          "Though we arrived into peak traffic - a long trail waited already at 9.15am in the hot sun, it was smooth to get on the cable car. We found the service very efficient and friendly. Thank you Dubrovnik!",
          "It was an okayish experience. Had to stand in a queue for a long time. There are better things that can be done in Dubrovnik :)",
          "A little bit expensive for normal people!apsolutly#!",
          "Nice view, but very overpriced and not much to do once you are up.",
          "great view of old town",
          "45 min or more wait to get in. 5 min or less drive, all crushed like sardines. If you want to shut the Old town the view could be incredible if there was less cables and construction of the cable car. Good view for the coast and Islands. Prices in the restaurant are a bit too high.",
          "Lovely view from the top. On a very hot day better buy return tickets. It's a must if you're in Dubrovnik.",
          "Great views over the old town of Dubrovnik and the beautiful coastline. Easy experience - tickets are available at the bottom and the top. You can buy a return ticket or choose to walk up or down and just get a one way. The Panorama restaurant up the top is a superb spot for a meal or a drink.",
          "Little pricy as is everything in Dubrovnik but fab views",

          "Excellent views of Dubrovnik and surrounding areas",
          "Very expencive ticket for short ride. There is cafe bar with expencive and not good coffe. What u can do is walk to the top with old Napoleon road wich he build around 1807. You will find here our War museum wich is really impresive with \u2026",

          "Worth it, but if the weather is nice and you are reasonably able.... walk back down.",
          "A perfect view above the old town of Dubrovnik mostly. In July 2018 we paid 150kn for both ways ride for an adult. It is worth it. Go when it is sunny or else the virw is not that great",
          "You can see nice view in evening. There are so many people on the top. But if you walk down the hill maybe 3 - 5 minute, you can see this view. this is really nice and there are no people. \nBe careful. if you go there, lots of rock can make you hurt.",

        "wiki": "Tourism is a major industry in Croatia. In 2018, Croatia had 19.7 million tourist visitors who made 110.275 million overnight stays. The history of tourism in Croatia dates back to the middle of the 19th century in the period around 1850. It has been developing successfully ever since. Today, Croatia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\nTourism in Croatia is concentrated in the areas along the Adriatic coast and is strongly seasonal, peaking in July and August.Eight areas in the country have been designated national parks, and the landscape in these areas is afforded extra protection from development. Currently, there are ten sites in Croatia inscribed on the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites and 15 sites on the tentative list.\nLonely Planet named Croatia as the top pick destination for 2005, while National Geographic Adventure Magazine named Croatia as Destination of the Year in 2006.\n\n\n== General ==\nCroatia has a rich historical and cultural heritage, and natural beauty. Its greatest advantage in terms of tourism is its Adriatic Sea coast which, according to the 2010 European Environment Agency's survey, had the second cleanest water in all of Europe. A mild Mediterranean climate with a warm summer and moderately cold winter favor tourism. The tourist offer of Croatia is very diverse and consists of nautical, excursion, diving, congress, cultural, ecological, rural, religious, adventure, hunting or fishing and health tourism.\nIn 2014, Croatia had 851 registered tourist facilities, of which 605 hotels, 84 campsites, 52 tourist apartments, 41 tourist settlements, 19 apart-hotels and 50 marinas. In all these facilities, there were more than 100,000 accommodation units and about 237,000 permanent beds. In 605 hotels, there were 53,217 accommodation units and 102,430 beds. Out of 605 hotels, 301 had three stars, 192 four, and 29 five stars. Adriatic.hr is a leading tourist agency providing online booking services on the Adriatic since 2000, they have over 13500 apartments and 500 hotels on offer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first tourist object in Croatia, considered the first Croatian hotel, is Villa Angiolina that was built in Opatija in 1844. In 1868 on the island of Hvar, a hygienic society was founded, and this year is considered to be the year of the beginning of organized tourism on the island. Hotel Kvarner was opened in Opatija in 1884, Hotel Therapia in 1894 in Crikvenica, and Hotel Imperial in 1896 in Dubrovnik. As early as 1914, Opatija recorded over half a million overnight stays, and tourists spent 20 days on average in the city.\nSocial benefits of tourism have gradually begun to be recognized so the legislation in tourism and catering was introduced. The hotel capacities of the time between the two world wars were mainly owned by foreigners, and 80% of foreign traffic was made by tourists from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.\nIn 1926, over one million overnight stays were recorded for the first time, and in 1929 there were more foreign guests visiting Croatia than local tourists (52% vs 48%). The Decree on the Improvement of Tourism and the Decree on Conditions for the Proclamation of Tourist Areas were enacted in 1936. The record tourist season in this period was in 1938 when 399,608 visitors made 2,719,939 overnight stays.\nSignificant development of tourism in Croatia began in 1952, but although the overall number of tourist was growing, Croatia lagged behind its competition in terms of profit, and the quality of services decreased. After WWII, Croatia was a federal constitute of SFR Yugoslavia so the overall tourist offer was rated as unfavorable according to the \"value for money\" criteria. Educated people were leaving the country for better-paid jobs overseas, and under such conditions, small private renters developed, and the Croatian coast become a destination for mass tourism, which was particularly evident in the 1980s. The expansion of tourism capacity building lasted until 1975, at a growth rate of 11.4% for basic capacities and 9.7% for complementary capacities. In that period, 69% of the basic and 72% of complementary capacities that were offered by Croatia on the tourism market in 1990 were built. 68.2 million overnight stays were recorded in 1986, while in 1987 there were 10,5 million visitors, representing the largest number of overnight stays and visitors up until Croatia's independence from SFR Yugoslavia in 1990. In that period, Croatia accounted for about 75% of foreign tourist revenues of Yugoslavia.\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence (1991\u20131995), tourism stagnated in Istria, while in much of Dalmatia and the areas affected by the war drastically fell. Between 1990 and 1995, the number of tourist arrivals was lower by as much as 69.3 percent, while the number of overnight stays fell by 75 percent, so the numbers were close to those recorded in the 1960s.\nAfter the war, tourism began to recover and in 1996 there was a slight increase in relation to the 1994 season. Gradually, foreign tourists returned. With the return of tourists, the interest of foreign investors in Croatia was growing steadily, with the introduction of foreign capital increasing the role of destination management and marketing efforts to promote Croatia as a whole and unique destination. The increase in tourist arrivals and overnight stays also generated large revenue which increased their share in the country's GDP, so that it rose from 7.2 percent in 1995 to 17 percent in 2002.\nSince 2000, a number of tourist overnight stays has been rising continuously (downfall was recorded only in 2008 due to the global financial crisis). The record tourist season with the best results in Croatia's history was recorded in 2017 when Croatia was visited by 17,400,000 tourists who had 86,200,000 overnight stays. That same year Croatia's tourism revenues amounted \u20ac9.5 billion. In 2013, Croatia joined the European Union. Since 2012, the year before Croatia joined the EU, the number of annual tourist arrivals increased by nearly 6 million. Economists argue that Croatia's joining the EU made them a more desirable tourist location due to reinvestment in their economy, more open trade barriers, and lessened customs control.Tourism is fairly well-developed in Croatia but has room to develop further. Only 15% of the coast, the main tourist attraction in Croatia, is urbanized, and many plans are in progress to gradually develop Croatia's tourism sector even more. The Croatian Tourism Development Strategy has a goal to make Croatia a globally recognized tourist destination for all seasons, and is working towards that goal by making more luxury accommodations, including hotels and tourist services, or renovating older ones. Croatia also has one of the UNWTO's Sustainable Tourism Observatories, part of the organization's International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). The observatory is considered a commitment to monitoring and building sustainable tourism.\n\n\n== Tourism statistics ==\n\n\n=== Arrivals by country ===\nMost visitors arriving to Croatia on short term basis were from the following countries of nationality:\n\n\n== Tourist regions ==\nThe Croatian National Tourist Board has divided Croatia into six distinct tourist regions.\n\n\n=== Istria ===\n\nThe west coast of the peninsula of Istria has several historical towns dating from Roman times, such as the city of Umag, which hosts the yearly Croatia Open ATP tennis tournament on clay courts.The city of Pore\u010d is known for the UNESCO-protected Euphrasian Basilica, which includes 6th-century mosaics depicting Byzantine art. The city plan still shows the ancient Roman Castrum structure with main streets Decumanus and Cardo Maximus still preserved in their original forms. Marafor is a Roman square with two temples attached. One of them, erected in the 1st century, is dedicated to the Roman god Neptune. Originally a Gothic Franciscan church built in the 13th century, the 'Dieta Istriana' hall was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century.\nThe region's largest city Pula has one of the best preserved amphitheatres in the world, which is still used for festivals and events. It is surrounded by hotel complexes, resorts, camps, and sports facilities. Nearby is Brijuni national park, formerly the summer residence of late Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. Roman villas and temples still lie buried among farm fields and along the shoreline of surrounding fishing and farming villages. The coastal waters offer beaches, fishing, wreck dives to ancient Roman galleys and World War I warships, cliff diving, and sailing. Pula is the end point of the EuroVelo 9 cycle route that runs from Gda\u0144sk on the Baltic Sea through Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia.\n\nThe town of Rovinj contains well-indented coastal areas with a number of small bays hidden within dense vegetation, open to naturists. Although the beaches are not specified as naturist, naturists frequent them.The interior is green and wooded, with small stone towns on hills, such as Motovun. The river Mirna flows below the hill. On the other side of the river lies Motovun forest, an area of about 10 square kilometres in the valley of the river Mirna, of which 280 hectares (2.8 km2) is specially protected. This area differs not only from the nearby forests, but also from those of the entire surrounding karst region because of its wildlife, moist soil, and truffles (Tuber magnatum) that grow there. Since 1999, Motovun has hosted the international Motovun Film Festival for independent films from the U.S. and Europe. Groznjan, another hill town, hosts a three-week jazz festival every July.\n\n\n=== Kvarner and Highlands ===\n\nOne of the most varying regions, the entire Kvarner gulf provides striking scenery, with tall mountains overlooking large islands in the sea. Opatija is the oldest tourist resort in Croatia, its tradition of tourism ranging from the 19th century.The former Venetian island towns of Rab and Lo\u0161inj are popular tourist destinations. The island of Rab is rich in cultural heritage and cultural-historical monuments. Rab is also known as a pioneer of naturism after the visit of King Edward VIII and Mrs Wallis Simpson.

Average air humidity is 70%, and the average summer temperature is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) and 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) during the winter.\n\nThe interior regions Gorski kotar, Velebit and Lika have mountain peaks, forests and fields, many animal species including bears, and the national parks of Risnjak and Plitvice Lakes. The Plitvice Lakes National Park lies in the Plitvice plateau which is surrounded by three mountains part of the Dinaric Alps: Plje\u0161evica mountain (Gornja Plje\u0161evica peak 1,640 m), Mala Kapela mountain (Seli\u0161ki Vrh peak at 1,280 m), and Medve\u0111ak (884 m). The national Park is underlain by karstic rock, mainly dolomite and limestone with associated lakes and caves, this has given rise to the most distinctive feature of its lakes. The lakes are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is deposited by the action of moss, algae, and bacteria. The encrusted plants and bacteria accumulate on top of each other, forming travertine barriers which grow at the rate of about 1 cm per year. The sixteen lakes are separated into an upper and lower cluster formed by runoff from the mountains, descending from an altitude of 636 to 503 m (2,087 to 1,650 ft) over a distance of some eight km, aligned in a south-north direction.\n\nThe lakes collectively cover an area of about two square kilometers, with the water exiting from the lowest lake to form the Korana River. The lakes are divided into the 12 Upper Lakes (Gornja jezera) and the four Lower Lakes (Donja jezera): Under the travertine waterfalls Cratoneuron moss sometimes grows, the moss gets encrusted with travertine and fresh moss grows further out, first a crag is formed but later a cave roof forms under the crag. If the water continues flowing the cave becomes progressively bigger. Limestone caves are present as well. The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species. Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species. At least 126 species of birds have been recorded there, of which 70 have been recorded as breeding.\n\n\n=== Dalmatia ===\n\n\n==== Zadar ====\n\nThis region caters to yachting and leisure travel.

          "Built in Gothic style, but harmoniously combining Renaissance and Baroque elements. It used to serve as the seat of the Rector of the Republic of Ragusa between the 14th century and 1808.",
          "Great museum, not a ton to see but then again, you can't photograph anything, which was not the case in any other museum in Croatia, it's like these guys want to hide vs show their collections, very awkward so overall, not a great experience.",
          "The REctors Palace is very interesting place with lotes of history. Beware of the hectic crowds and the heat (depending on the time of year)",
          "Quite an interesting place with the usual items of historical interest. Swords etc but of real interest was the safe boxes. I have not seen these outside of images in books. This was a highlight for me. In winter when we went due to no crowds we did all the sights as it was",
          "Beautiful building, a key GoT sight and what I loved is that they don\u2019t make you pay to get in to get a photo of a key scene. You can walk up to the rope and snap a shot",
          "This Palace located at the corner of Stradun ( main street) near Luza square now houses cultural history museum. It was once centre of government and official residence of Rector of Republic of Dubrovnik. There is admission ticket.",
          "The Rector's Palace is situated on the eastern side of old Dubrovnik and we gained entrance via our Dubrovnik card. This is a 15th century palace that houses many collections e.g. icons, old masters, coins, statues, antique furniture, weaponry etc. of historical exhibits",
          "The Rector was of paramount importance in Dubrovnik\u2019s history, defending the independence of the city. The Palace holds many of the pivotal relics and pictures representing much of Dubrovnik\u2019s history. Myth has it that Orlando (aka Roland) was prominent in defending the city",
          "As a historian, I was very disappointed on what was on display here, particularly in view of the hefty 100kuna (\u00a312) entrance fee. All the rooms had a totally sterile, atmospheric-less feel to them. There was very little inside the rooms anyhow and what there was in no way",
          "This was an interesting place to see and understand the history of the city. I learned a lot about the links with what are now other countries in the region. There were some very good artefacts in a range of rooms which move through time. The building is in good condition and",
          "Interesting little museum. went as part of the Dubrovnik pass. Some nice artefacts but could do with a little more explanation. Good place to take a break from the crowds but wouldn't get the ticket on its own.",
          "I guess I have been spoiled by Italy. I enjoyed this attraction, but did expect a little more in the way of things to see. It is a part of the \"Dubrovnik Card's array of attractions so it was cool to be able to see. But it could have a bit more.",
          "Not too many people go into this palace (entry ticket 15 Euros) but I found it very interesting. There are plenty of art, artifacts, historical documents and many other things on display. Excepting in the open areas of the palace, photography isn\u2019t allowed, though you will find",
          "The rectors palace is of interest to those who enjoy inspecting artefacts from days long gone. What was the highlight for me was the money boxes or treasure chests they used in the 15th and 16th century. The locking mechanisms are all hand crafted, but so intricate that it is",
          "This is an interesting museum, with a fascinating glimpse into the past. If you like old buildings and seeing the original furniture, furnishings, etc, then you should definitely check this place out. We got the combined ticket with other museums which keeps costs down.",
          "Columns and amazing architecture in old town with a backdrop of polished cobbles by the millions of feet that have travelled them",
          "Seeing some negative reviews here and I want to balance with my opinion of the museum. Its was amazing! I loved the architecture and the 100s of classical art pieces (some hilarious and meme worthy) the dungeon the videos showing the history and the staircase. We bought a",
          "Honestly we went to the Rectors Palace as it was raining and having read The Lonely Planet guide book it was recommended that this was the best museum to go to. I have to say I was not impressed. There was little to no information relating to the pieces and building itself. I",
          "The museum was quite nice but the straff was rude and made the visit unpleasant. Also found that there was little explenations around things that were displayed. The woman in the museum shop screamed at visitors and was more occupied with making sure no one but museum guests",
          "We were taken on a tour through here with our group, so not sure of the cost. What an amazing selection of history especially interesting when a tour guide explains everything. Make sure you have coins in and around this area for toilets.",
          "Surprised at how much I enjoyed the visit. The building is fantastic. Lots of good information on the history of Dubrovnik. Disappointed two rooms roped off that would have been nice to enter.",
          "A small tour, a wee bit pricey, but worth the doing for the architecture of the palace and some of its exhibits. Time well spent.",
          "Lovely architecture and nice use of space internally. Some interesting exhibits to peruse around. The safe boxes are amazing and intriguing. Saw quite a few immature males and one female use the handrail and the large stone hand fixings on them to set up amusing photo",
          "This building and its architecture are just stunning. The museum has plenty to offer and lots to read and learn throughout. It's not very big and you don't need more than 1 hour in there. I've been a couple of times, including a live performance by the Dubrovnik Symphony",
          "We stopped at Dubrovnik for a couple of days before we were aboard our cruise and we fell in love with the city. Rector\u2019s Place is one of the cities highlights for sure but overall, the city certainly deserves a fair amount of time to spare",
          "It's a very beautiful palace, with lot of history related with the old Dubrovnik republic. Now it has a museum explaining all the history and art of the time. I totally recommend to visit it, and use the Dubrovnik card so that you can enter more attractions in the same day and",
          "The Rector's Palace is now a cultural history museum; formerly it was the home of the Rector and Dubrovnik Republic's seat of government. Housed there is a fine collection of furniture, paintings, coins and other objects from as early as the 16th century. I was very impressed",
          "Apparently well-to-do rectors lived in this beautiful palace for centuries. It\u2019s a majestic building with a stunning courtyard. Its obvious USP is the fact that the Game of Thrones was filmed here. The inner court yard has steps leading to upper galleries which exhibit",
          "As the name suggest this was once the seat of the Rector. The architechture is beautiful and there are plenty of historical exhibits such as coins, uniforms, sedan seats and other artifacts.",
          "The Rector's Palace is located on the left after walking through Luza Square in Dubrovnik Old Town. As the name suggests, this was once the palace of the head of government, but now houses the Cultural History Museum (entrance fee). Well worth stopping to check out the ornately",
          "Located between the Clock Tower and the Cathedral , the Rector's Palace , originally used to serve as the seat of the Rector of the Republic of Ragusa between the 14th century and 1808. During the centuries it was damaged by fires and earthquakes and reconstructed in Gothic",
          "Yes, there is the history and the museum but I loved the opportunities inside and out for photography. Worth the price of admission for anyone looking for classic photos.",
          "Beautiful Venetian stile palace. Extremely suitable for a classical concert in the evening. Amazing architecture, nice details, beautiful terrace with a great view over the old harbor.",
          "The palace\u2019s interior spaces are not very opulent, but there are several very impressive ceilings. The exhibitions consist of paintings, furniture, vases, palanquins, coins, arms, and art objects \u2013 not overwhelming, not exceptional, but nice to browse.",
          "In the main square of Luza, this museum shows historical culture in a beautiful old building with several rooms and a beautiful courtyard.",
          "The city for the setting of Game of Thrones, really great full of narrow streets and passages spectacular views everywhere. Took a rest from walking by visiting the Rectors Place Museum, very interesting seeing many artefacts.",
          "This is the one building at the end of the Stradun with some history that everyone and all the tour books recommend seeing. I didn't find the appeal frankly. This used to be the Rector's palace for the head of the Dubrovnik government way back when. It has been built and",
          "Had a good visit here. It\u2019s stunning exterior is matched by the interior and is worth a visit for the photo opportunities",
          "The outside of the building is the best part, which you can see for free. The interior lacks atmosphere and I have to admit I was disappointed. I think it\u2019s overpriced.",
          "At the end of the stratum near the port. Spend 30 plus minutes wandering around several rooms. Highlights included the 'dragon's dungeon for prisoners, the court, and the iron money boxes. Part of the dubrovnik card",
          "After visiting many museums in Europe, I felt a bit let down by the Rector's Palace. It does not have the gorgeous interiors of many museums I saw. However I learned something new here about the votive and there is a good write up about it and some exhibits to show for it.",
          "This a fine example of Gothic-Renaissance architecture. Beautiful facade of finely carved arches and columns. But the interior is yet another forgettable visit not worth the entry fee.",
          "If you like history or the game of thrones (tv show), you need to see this. Great place in the heart of Dubrovnik.",
          "The building is originally gothic with very nice windows and subsequently Renaissance porch and columns were added -both very nice. Now a museum related to Ragusa Republic history. There is a nice collection of artifacts, but details seem ot not have left a compelling impression.",
          "Well preserved ans renovated building. Now acts as a museum. The exhibit is rather limited, but the visit gives you an idea how the richest lived in the early days. Closes at 6pm even during the high season, so make sure you go early enough.",
          "Our tour group was embarking a walking tour around this old town and this is one of the key landmark of the city where visitors will not miss. The building design and structure were nice, representing the Croatian culture, history and ancient past. They were quite a decent",
          "Was expecting a little more. In and out within half an hour. Thought it was very overpriced for what it had to offer. Disappointed.",
          "If you buy the city card for 225kn online for a day or 275kn for 3 days it'll give you 6 free bus rides, normally 15kn and access to a load of museums and the walls. This palace was interesting and well worth a visit of you have the card. It is hot inside so be prepared to sweat.",
          "Well worth a visit to view some impressive paintings & antique furniture in a pleasant setting. Give it a go.",
          "I heard that the palace is a must see, so off I went. It is nice, but it's most definitely overpriced, and the building is much more impressive on the outside. Still there are plenty of rooms to see inside, a few carriages and some other bits and bobs",
          "We did not go into the palace but sat in the lovely stone benches outside to cool off. I think we met the palace cat the carpet specially placed gives it away",
          "Free entry with The Dubrovnik Card which makes it worth it. The building is very fine, peaceful and cool. What a place. But the inside exhibits could be much better presented and explained. Someone needs to work on the notices or produce a decent guide book.",
          "The \u201cRector's Palace\u201d is another nice place in the old town that was used to serve as the seat of the \u201cRector of the Republic of Ragusa\u201d this between the 14th century and the year 1808. It was also the seat of the Minor Council and the state administration. Furthermore, it",
          "As this was part of our 7 day card we went in. Not sure if I would have paid. Interesting to a point but not a lot of info provided about a lot of the things which meant it lacked context. Pretty building.",
          "The man and woman working the ticket counter were very rude to tourists. We had Euros instead of Kuna and could not get in. They did not offer to tell us where to get Kuna. We then waited for our family to get Kuna and the staff assumed we were trying to sneak in because we look",
          "Lovely building with interesting exhibits. Included as part of the 1,3 and 7 day Dubrovnik card, but not sure we would have visited otherwise. However we did enjoy having a wander around and were pleasantly surprised to find it was one of the locations that GoT was filmed.",
          "I visited this museum using the Dubrovnik card. There were a lot of different kinds of things in the museum including art work and furniture. There were some good descriptions in English. The museum is on several floors and has good historical information about the city. I",
          "Old town Dubrovnik is stunning. The historic sights within the walls are many and the Rector's Palace is just one. What is becoming the most notable here is the, \"Game of Thrones\" tour. It's well known that this incredibly popular show was filmed in Dubrovnik and if you are a",
          "Very Beautiful palace, home of many wealthy rectors for hundreds of years. The furniture was beautiful.",
          "It was an imposing building particulay the inner courtyard with its exterior steps leading up to the uppper galleries. Content was fairly standard museum exibits",
          "Enter when you can, the courtyard is stunning, and have a coffee or cocktail in the terrace of the bar next to it for a true mediterraenean break.",
          "I have to say that this place was much more impresive from the outside that it was inside, the arhitecture of this building is eye catching. If you are into history than you will definitely enjoy a tour of its inside chambers: old paitings(not to many),an entire room dedicated",
          "A nice palace which is worth the visit. If you are also seeing the city walls and monastery then buy a day pass from tourist information as it will save you money. Look out for the hands on the handrails.",
          "Th Rectors Palace is part of a slightly larger cultural history museum and it's free with the Dubrovnik Card. Worth paying the entrance fee, it's a good place to see some properly old paintings, war chests, and (my favourite) the original bell hammers from the clock tower.",
          "We used our Dubrovnik card and gained entry to the palace at no extra cost, loved the old Sudan chairs and exhibition of chest of drawers. Very pretty worth a visit.",
          "Entrance to the Palace was included in our \"Dubrovnik Card\" - but worth paying to go in. There is a a room dedicated to casualties of the Homeland War. Very moving.",
          "The Rector's Palace has an unusual history, and is filled with interesting displays & collections. The building itself is open, lovely, & restful. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This palace is worth looking at. It has been restored after the war. Te staircase is now in the original condition, previously the railing was painted. In the museum You can look at the masterpieces of art and furniture, the cabinet exhibition showed local decorative cabinets",
          "Scores of visitors turned away due to closure The tourist was not advising people buying Dubrovnik cards Also the maritime museum is also closed Not impressed!",
          "If you get a Day Pass from Tourist Information this is included. Certainly worth a look inside and a wander around.",
          "Do this by getting the Dubrovnik Card for 1-day. The experience will be included and is a neat way to get in to this experience.",
          "The building is beautiful. There some beautiful paintings and sculptures around.You need about an hour here.",
          "The rectors palace was one of the entry passes granted with the Dubrovnik Day Pass so we tried it to see, The building was lovely, some rooms interesting and the are quite reasonable with many works from the 1500's and 1600's. The range of art was mostly paintings and a few",
          "My daughter and I only went because it was open until 4pm and most things had shut at 3pm. I quite liked the stuff on the ground floor (religious art, a room of iron chests, etc) but I'm not a fan of period rooms so it was only the architecture that drew me upstairs. Then we",
          "We visited here as part of our Dubrovnik Card (1 day pass) purchase. An interesting building built in the 14th century. Inside is a number of statues and information that informs a person of what the rooms were used for or history of some of the historic artefacts. There are a",
          "This is a wonderful ancient building with an interesting collection. From paintings, sculpture, furniture to maritime antiques there is something for everyone It is so central that it really should not be missed.",
          "Having a couple of hours to spare in Dubrovnik, we decided to pay a visit to this place. We didn't quite know what to expect. The place is host to some old furniture (benches, locking chests, etc.), some furnished rooms upstairs and some sculptures. The main attraction are",
          "Included entrance in the 120kn museum ticket pass with other very interesting museum like the Modern and the Ethnological. Rector\u2019s Palace is a beautiful building with interesting parcours, gorgeous furnitures, a GOT filming location and a little caf\u00e9.",

          "The Rector\u2019s Palace is a historic monument in in Dubrovnik. The impassive building displays the \u201cartistic and historical heritage of the Republic of Ragusa\u201d. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful buildings I\u2019ve seen! Originally constructed during the 12th century, the Palace was",
          "A very interesting museum, we spent about an hour in this palace and found it quite informative and well set out. There are pamphlets in English and other languages available at the door. Staff were helpful when asked and though the ticket price was a little expensive, if you",
          "Some great history to see. Well presented and worth a visit. The artifacts and rooms provide a first hand experience",

          "The Rector\u2019s Palace is a Gothic-style structure built sometime during the 14th century. Over the years, renovation and restoration work performed on the building resulted in the incorporation of Renaissance and Baroque architectural styles. From the 14th to the 18th-centuries,",
          "It really helps to read up on places beforehand, because while it's called the Rector's Palace; it was also a prison, an armory, where town council met, housed the apartment of the reigning director (rector) of the municipality and included administrative offices. Originally",
          "This beautiful building is located on the Strandun the main street in the old town. Entry is 80 krona. It is worth seeing for the beauty of the building and the exhibitions in the Museum. Th original building dated back to the middle ages but was destroyed by fire in the 1400s.",
          "Entry was 80 Kuna, only cash Rectors palace is on an old building that housed a rector who could not leave without permission. Today there are examples of furniture, vases, clocks, other furnishings, and paintings from centuries past, most with religious theme. Near to the",
          "The Rector's Palace is a fascinating place to visit. You may go to where they used to house inmates in not so nice conditions. Upstairs offers a view into the lives of the well-to-do back then.",
          "We had the old town walking tour and our guide told us this old palace is now a museum and a concert hall. We peeked inside the door to see the impressive courtyard. Beautiful sandstone construction. There is a gift store too.",
          "The palace had an exhibition to maritime maps which was really good. The overall display of the palace was a little disappointing and could have been made a little better.",
          "This museum is situated in one of the only buildings left as they were from the middle ages. Exhibits relate to the history of the town and the building, and more. Not huge, and will take you about an hour to be done with, but worth your time. If memory serves they do not allow",
          "It cost 80 kunar (\u00a38) each to visit here and I think it was money well spent. The first thing we saw was the collection of religious art which was colourful and moving. The small portable altar was novel and the statues were interesting. The bust of Cleopatra with an asp was",
          "Well worth a visit. Lots of interesting exhibitions / displays. Don't miss the war photo one. Even better as it's included in the Dubrovnik card deal.",
          "We loved the palace as 1/ It wasn\u2019t crowded 2/ It was free with Dubrovnik card 3/ It had interesting antiques, paintings, dungeon, and an interesting photographic display of the homeland war 4/ A toilet that was free 5/ A lovely building Worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful building, great exhibits, interesting stories. Helpful staff. One of the best museums in Dubrovnik.",
          "We wouldn't have bothered with the palace if it hadn't rained, but it did It's a nice spot. There's a few interesting exhibits, toilets and a place to sit and eat your lunch. (Bring your own) There is a coffee machine but no other refreshments. Good for an hour.",
          "This is a very attractive building and houses a museum - the cultural history museum. It also houses the music concert hall. This building has a lot of history. It used to serve as the seat of the Rector of the Republic of Ragusa . The Venetian - Gothic arches and columns is the",
          "There was lots to see in the Palace, furnished rooms, collections of artefacts, a sobering photographic exhibition of life during and after the war of 1991-2 and a fascinating temporary exhibition of maps and charts. The building itself is beautiful with crisply carved limestone",
          "it was a lovely space towalk through at our own pace; don't do a tour group! The exhibition placards/explanations are quite thorough. Fascinating architecture. We went mid afternoon and it was a cool reprieve from the heat of the city, you could understand how the houses and",
          "Outside in the old city there are mobs of tourists yet inside this significant and fascinating building it was quiet. So it was possible to amble slowly through the various parts and rooms. Some are decorated in historic styles. Some are purely exhibition spaces. There was a",

          "Rector's Palace was the seat of government, with rectors being elected for only one month -- residents didn't want the power to go to their head. Now you can find ladies from the outer regions who make lace setting up tables out front to sell their wares -- everything from",
          "A bit pricy to get in - 60 Kuna. Full of old furniture and weapons. A visit to the cells was of interest, especially the one that had a dragon scratched into it at the entrance from some poor previous occupant",
          "We haven\u2019t been inside as my toddler wouldn\u2019t have the patience to look around. That said the building from the outside is nice to look at and doubles up as a useful seating area which many tourists make use of during the day. It\u2019s under shade too so it\u2019s well worth a visit to",
          "Inside the Rectors Palace was a photographic exhibition of the Homeland War. The photographs were very sobering and emotive, especially when one has walked around the streets and walls and visited some of their beautiful Churches. All War is horrible, but we remembered when this",
          "This is also the Cultural History Museum and is included on your Dubrovnik card so worth exploring. I loved the rooms of the palace and the old trunks and my husband enjoyed the room of old maps on display. It does get busy with tour groups though.",
          "You will definitely walk past this gorgeous building, as you walk through and around Luza Square, Old City's principal square, the one with the clock tower. We didn't feel the need to go inside, as the decor is meant to be very sparse. The exterior arches are elegant and",
          "A fascinating place. You can see how it was used as the Seat of Government as the upstairs is furnished. There are several interesting displays including photos from the war in 1992. At the moment there is a fascinating touring exhibition of old maps. The toilets are excellent",
          "Game of Thrones fans will enjoy the palace perhaps more than others. My wife and I visited the palace since we bought the 1 day Dubrovnik card which includes access to the wall and like 6 other museums within the city walls. The palace itself is full of amazing art which is",
          "This is one of the grandest buildings in the city, take an hour and potter round. There is currently a superb exhibition of war photography going on. Good insight into the political and cultural life of the city.",
          "This was interesting to visit, see view the pieces keep over the centuries through different Rectors times in office. The size and scale of the dwelling was impressive.",
          "The Rectors Palace was the administration centre of medieval Dubrovnik, where the elected Rector would live and work for his month of office only allowed out for official duties. It is simply decorated, but the story is clearly told of its place in the history of the region, and",
          "This was definitely worth the stop since we had purchased the Dubrovnik Card which gave us free entrance. The staff inside were full of extra information on all the exhibits so be sure to ask if you want to know more about what you are looking at. Highlights were the original",
          "I visited the Rector's Palace on two occasions during my time in Dubrovnik, at first solo and then with a couple of hostel friends. On neither occasion was it particularly busy despite the city surging with people outside, so it offered a calm refuge to explore a range of",
          "Located between Luza and the Cathedral, this is one of the old buildings that make Dubrovnik's streetscape what it is. An elegant building, as befitted the \"rector\" of the city-state in its heyday. Admission is a reasonable 80 kn (10 GBP) for adults, 25 kn (3 GBP) for",
          "What a fabulous piece of architecture. A few museums that can keep you busy inside the walls, or just sit on the \"stoep\" and watch the world go by giving your legs and feet a bit of a rest.",

          "There are a few little museums within the walls that you get as part of the Dubrovnik card - this is perhaps the only one that would be worth considering doing if you don\u2019t have the card. It was interesting and provided decent descriptions of the items throughout. It doesn\u2019t",
          "i don't know what is more impressive the building, which is a monument, the art collection, or the collection of historical items a must do when in dubrovnik if you plan to do the walls tour, get a dubrovnik card and enter both attractions + 6 more for cheap",
          "A nice collection of artifacts and a lot of variety. Photos of 1991 war were very good. There are a lot of steps. Not good for someone with mobility issues.",
          "Did not have a chance to visit inside but the outside architecture is quite impressive - has a lot of history of nobility.",
          "Honestly, it was just ok! A few of the exhibits were interesting (sedan chairs, iron boxes, the war photo exhibit) but beyond that it was pretty mediocre for us. The building itself is impressive but we could\u2019ve skipped this one.",
          "An interesting small palace and museum in Dubrovnik that showed the history of Dubrovnik and the rector ruling system. It will take less than an hour to look and walk through all the exhibits. The most interesting things were the stone hand holding the rails of the staircase",
          "This place was nice and worth a quick visit, like a mini version of some of the nicer buildings in Italy.",
          "Well maintained tiny little palace within the old town. They have a museum, a coffee shop and an exhibition space. The place looks great from the outside at night. Entry fee applicable.",
          "Ticket price included in the Dubrovnik card, otherwise not sure I would have come here. Wide variety of furniture and paintings, money chests, sedans. Interesting war photo small exhibition on ground floor tucked away probably the best part for me. Look out for the hands on",
          "The Rectors rotated among the city \"fathers\" and each one stayed for a month to make decisions with the council members. The exhibits are worth the ticket price, not as many people inside as walking along the streets outside. Have a refreshment area for a quick drink/bite, but",
          "Quick visit as part of our Game of Thrones tour, went in and took a photo of the courtyard where the scene between Khaleesi and the Spice King takes place in season 2.",
          "It is great to get inside one of the palaces and this was one that was used in filming Game of Thrones. There are some interesting exhibits and you can walk through the state apartments that the rector used. A strange system were a person was only in charge of the city for a",
          "It is an impressive building both externally and internally. A look at the outside is all most visitors see but it is well worth the entry fee to visit. The museum tells the story of how Dubrovnik was ruled through the Rector system and how the city became prominent in a number",
          "Although there is nothing exceptional that is displayed in the museum, it is still interesting and worth visiting. The exhibits show the city's history over the ages, including some interesting photos of the 1991 war. Don\u2019t miss the staircase leading up to the second story that",
          "A must do is to take a guided tour of the old town of Dubrovnik where you will come across and later investigate some of the wonderful architecture and history of Dubrovnik including the Rectors place which is well worth seeing.",
          "The grey stone exterior gives little clue to some of the ornate rooms within the building and well worth 80Kn entry in my view. There are good information boards beside exhibits along with an overall brochure given with entry tickets, and the staff are more than willing to",
          "Very nice beautiful building with a small museum. It\u2019s been restored to its former glory and the rooms were the Rector lived and work are pleasant and well decorated. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth paying the ticket price for it, however if you buy the Dubrovnik card it is included",
          "I understand this building has just undergone restoration and it certainly looks good both inside and out. The cost of entry is on par with most other attractions through Europe. It exhibits everything from art and furniture to coins and weapons. The only disappointment was",
          "We used a Dubrovnik card to gain admittance - I don\u2019t think it was worth the actual price of the general admittance - quite interesting exhibits - but nothing that outstanding. Photography is banned - fair enough by me - what irked me was that staff are on those that do in a",
          "Be on the lookout around town for concerts in this location. We were very lucky to enjoy an orchestral concert together with 4 opera singers. As the concert progresses people move around in the breaks and dont be limited to sitting in designated seats. The gallery or the steps",
          "It is not clearly signposted, besides a small sign next to the door, that this is the Rector's Palace/Cultural Historical Museum. The initial layout after you pay is a little confusing, as you go into a small room with paintings and displays. These pictures are beautiful, and",
          "I only dropped in because it was free with the Dubrovnik card, but was very impressed by the architecture, Sadly I didn\u2019t see a map or guide so missed the cellars mentioned in some of the reviews. There was no English interpretation without the brochure so make sure you get one.",
          "I think this is one of the best locations in the old town. The palace is not too big and you wont get tired walking around the palace.",
          "Lovely airy building with lovely atrium and small museum, with a nice shop. We attended a symphony concert there one evening which was amazing.",
          "This was a pleasant surprise in Old Town. Well worth the visit for history buffs. Nice collection of paintings and artifacts, but also great architectural design. Highlights include the armory and the jail cells.",
          "One of the best places to visit in old Dubrovnik for history lovers. Many floors and rooms with very versatile collection.",

          "The rector's palace was under restoration when we were there unfortunately. From what we could see it is beautiful",
          "His building is often used for chamber music concerts because of the outstanding acoustics. It has survived explosions and earthquakes throughout the years. With the Corinthian columns it give this palace a Gothic-Renaissance look.",

          "Although you can look through the gate, the Rector\u2019s Palace in Old Town in closed for renovations. Amazing columns and works of art are able to be viewed from the outside. Many pigeons in the area, and lovely ledges to sit and watch people.",
          "This is a beautiful building and I got some excellent exterior shots. Sadly it is closed for restoration at present, but the door is open and you can photograph from there.",
          "This is yet another beautiful building at the top of the Stratum, like the name suggests, previously used as the Rectors Palace. It is now used as a small museum, and also hosts the extremely moving Memorial Room to the Dubrovnik Defenders.",
          "This building has absolutely beautiful architecture. They could use the space a little better. The Memorial Room of the Defenders of Dubrovnik is inside this building.",
          "A singular place for a singular use as a residence of a rector. The inscription above the entrance door reminds the rector of his responsibility.",
          "We were on a small ship cruise and visited this palace as part of the tour. I had been in Dubrovnik years before but must of missed this beautiful palace. Make sure you see the museum and the various areas in the courtyard.",
          "Visited as part of a tour of Dubrovnik arranged via our cruise ship. A very pretty building with lots of interest. I enjoyed the tour of the building as it provided information on the history of the building, Dubrovnik as a whole and how the 'old town' was administered in the",
          "Make sure you explore every staircase and corner off the main courtyard, I nearly missed a few interesting exhibitions! This was my favourite tourist attraction in the old town. Beautiful architecture and a great collection, way more than just some rooms with paintings and old",
          "This is a place worth spending time to really look at it and appreciate the work that went into it. It is quite an impressive structure.",
          "Our guide pointed out that this is the place where a different governor stayed for 30 days and ruled the city. He didn't have the power but he got the fame. In the middle of old town Dubrovnik.",
          "They want you to visit so have put some intresting things in the smaller rooms. Grand rooms sparse. Building most interesting. Some Homeland war photos.",
          "Rector\u2019s Palace was the place all the government decisions were made. There afr are five ore six rooms that can be visited. It is worth the time to visit the palace.",
          "The building is impressive, not so much the interior. Somewhat small with hidden alleys, an old prison cell and various mediocre artefacts.",
          "You can learn about local history as well as see how the local governors lived. It was nice but i expected it more luxurious inside",
          "There is a fee to enter. It is not exceptional by any means but it is historical and interesting to visit. It is worth an hour of your time. The architecture is excellent.",
          "The Rector's Palace houses exhibits showing the city's history over the ages. The exhibits were interestingly enough but I think my favorite part were the stone hands holding the railing on the side of the stairs leading up to the second floor!",
          "located in the old town. nice palace. a lot of history around. a lot of other places around to see as well. many cafes, bars, restaurants and shops around. u got to walk here, no car. it was very windy during my visit. very clean and organised place. i liked it.",
          "80kn entree fee. I did this while my daughter climbed the walls. It's about average and nothing special at all.",
          "Attended a concert in the Rectors Palace, performance by members of the Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra. Concert last approx 1.10hrs. Cost \u20ac13. Well worth every cent. A nice way to close down a lovely day in Dubrovnik",
          "We went to a concert here in the evening and were very surprised. When we entered, we realised it was open to the heavens. The stairs spiral up to a higher gallery where some of the audience were able to enjoy the music playing below. A special evening.",
          "This is a beautiful and interesting building inside and out with nice displays. Well worth going in. The historical notes are interesting too....read about the Rectors who lived in the Palace for only ONE month and needed permission to go outside. Amazing!",
          "best museum in Dubrovnik. interesting photos of 1991 war-some very old paintings. interesting building and history",
          "This beautiful building houses a museum, with interesting exhibits that include period furniture, artwork, costumes, etc. Spend some time in the internal courtyard, to reflect on the amazing history of this complex!",
          "We went to the Rectors palace during the day to see the various items on dispaly and enjoyed the many items of interest. We also attended a music show in the courtyard at night and it was a beautiful venue for an event. Highly recommended.",
          "the whole area is unbelievable to walk around. Is very memorable. Is a must do before there is a tourism limit cap!",
          "Rector's Palace offers interesting exhibition on old Dubrovnik, culture and art. There is a lot to see but fairly little information on about the collections though. War photos expo was impressive. Enjoyed the Renaissance style architecture too.",
          "Beautiful design inside. There wasn't any information alongside any of the items in the museum. We would have like to have read more detailed accounts about what they were used for ect! It explained a lot about how the museum obtained the item rather than what the item actually",
          "We enjoyed the museum. It is light and airy and the architecture is beautiful. Some interesting exhibits and peep into Dubrovniks history.",
          "Beautiful museum. I enjoyed the fact that it was diverse in its exhibitions, with both the old palace feel, and the photos from the war. Would recommend for a rainy day.",
          "Interesting place, beautifully decorated rooms and fascinating ancient objects particularly the security boxes. I loved the handrails ascending the stairs.",
          "The Rector's Palace houses a Dubrovnik Museum. It's a lovely building in the Venician Renessance style with a beautiful staircase in the courtyard. The Rector was a high government official during the Dubrovnik Republic until 1806 when the Napoleonic Army ended it's sovereignty.",
          "Very well kept building Nice to walk on this street and see all excellent buildings you feel like you are in another period",
          "While walking around Dubrovnik's Old Town there is so much to see. One of the stand-out buildings during our most recent visit was the Rector's Palace. Its interesting architecture with a splendid facade and its prominent location drew our attention to it. Another feature of the",
          "The best part of this attraction is the building itself, truly a fantastic bit of architecture. The museum and content therein is pretty standard and we kind of found ourselves skim reading the information, but well worth a visit.",
          "It's a lovely old building located on the main thoroughfare. If you are into architecture and local history then worth a visit although probably worth a guide to get the most out of it. It was a tad expensive for what it was as its not somewhere I would spend hours",
          "While the architecture of the palace looking from the courtyard is beautiful, the expositions were at best satisfactory. If you're into royalty, palace touring, or architecture, go for it. Otherwise, spend the entrance fee for another drink at the cliff bar.",
          "The Rector's palace is a place that can take you on a time travel back to the Rectors era. Even though there are not many things to be seen, its definitely a place to be visited for getting close to the history of the town and the importance of the Rectors in the past.",
          "I think it's only ordinary museum. I finished to watch all exhibitions in 40 minutes. If you have a lot of time or Dubrovnik ticket, it might be okay to come here.",
          "Worth going into - we went when it was raining one day. Good to walk around and get a feel for the ancient place.",
          "This building is way more attractive from the outside. There is very little to see inside and it is definitely more Town Hall than Palace. Everything in Dubrovnik is beautiful, but in my opinion, this is not worth the entrance fee",
          "If you like to discover a bit of croatian history, it\u00b4s a MUST! the museum is really nicely put together and if you like Game of Thrones, you can experience a little \"Daenerys\"-moment here.",
          "This place is lovely. So much history and beauty. Once again, the staff were grumpy and made me feel most unwelcome, though. There is a lot to see, but you mustn't touch any of it. I felt that it would've been nice if it had some seats so visitors can sit down and make more of",
          "Worth a visit inside as the furnishings and other items on display are very interesting. Allow 1 hour, included in Dubrovnik card. The \"hands\" on the staircase are very different .",
          "Monday: visited the Palace and Museum. Well organised and presented to get an impression of some of the figures of the Republic of Ragusa. And other things such as rooms, paintings, furniture, weapons, cutlery, ... Wednesday: attended a concert of the Dubrovnik Symphony",
          "It is lovely from the outside, and the large room inside. However asides from that, the museum element to it isn't too interesting and is quite limited to only a few key, interesting things. It is free on the Dubrovnik card, otherwise I wouldn't have paid for it.",
          "Loved the building, great design. Free with Dubrovnik card, great place to take photos, do not miss.",
          "This is the palace inside the old town. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the Rector functioned from here. From the outside the palace looks lovely. You will surely see this palace as you walk around the old town.",
          "Of course I was going to pay to go inside the Rector's Palace. As a fan of Game of Thrones I was looking forward to seeing the staircase featured in scenes from Qarth, but it was filled with all manner of other interesting items well worth taking a look at.",
          "One of the priettiest museum to see in Dubrovnik. Along with City Walls and Maritain Museum. Be sure to buy \"DubrovnikCard\" at tourist information point. It will save you money and time. Try to google it to learn more. If you are in Dubrovnik by car, you can park it near the",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Rectors Palace at no extra cost if you buy the Dubrovnik card. As well as the historical architecture and rooms the exhibition on the war was really interesting",
          "My friend and I went to a guitar concert in here as part of the Dubrovnik Festival. It's absolutely beautiful. It can be warm with no AC and little air flow, but it was built 500 years ago! The design is definitely worth visiting.",
          "A nice and interesting historical museum in a nice historic building. Not overwhelming, but it does tell you something about the history of Dubrovnik.",
          "The palace is well preserved. The first floor exhibits describing the governance and independent statehood of Dubrovnik over the centuries is fascinating to a history buff. It profiles famous Croatians/Dubrovnikers of previous centuries (when Dubrovnik, or the Republic of",
          "Rector's Palace was undergoing renovation when we visited the Old City in late May. The front of the building has a nice design with intricate and individual carvings. There is protected seating where you can people watch and directly across the plaza is the pathway Od Puca",
          "You can explore, the building is lovely. There are nice collections of art as well. This building was used for governance in the era of the Republic and you can see the archives room and courtroom, etc. There are some good interpretive signs. They have a lovely art collection",
          "Rector's Palace or Knezev Dvor how locals call it used to be a seat of govern of this mini-republic. Nowadays is the site of numerous cultural events, such as concerts during Dubrovnik Summer Festival.",
          "Can't miss this place while walking around. the arches are superb and sometimes people have tables and sell stuff.",
          "Lets get one thing straight...im a tourist... 90% of art work was titled... and thats it. No story...history...information on the art work ...a date...a title...done. I like to learn things going to a gallery... I went to take a photo of a statue and thought i was going to be",
          "In Dubrovnik everything is must see. Everything is close. In two hours walk you can see everything and take care not to miss this one",
          "The Rectors Palace was on my Top 3 must-dos for Old Town and I would certainly have felt that something would be missing from my visit to Dubrovnik without it. There are nice examples of architectural styles throughout the building and a few state rooms as befitting of a palace,",
          "We went into the Rector's Palace only because it's included on our combi ticket with the Maritime Museum. It has lots of pretty articles inside...we were most taken with the courtroom and the pharmacy bottles. Well worth the visit.",
          "Lovely museum with beautiful furnishings and portraits of past residents. Downstairs there are portraits of men who greatly contributed to the fields of history, science and medicine who lived in Dubrovnik when it was at it's prime. Building is interesting to those of us who",
          "Went in as it is included in the 1 day Budapest card. Interesting place over 2 floors however not alot to see. Very busy with several tour groups.",
          "Interesting space with exhibits which detail courtly life in dubrovnik from the renaissance and beyond. Lovely spaces architecturally with fine examples of glass chandeliers, Iron trunks and carriages. The exhibition may not interest everyone however it is spacious, well laid",
          "Interesting place, worth a litle side visit, it is included in your Dubrovnik pass if you bought one. I think the day Pass can be worth it as if you are on a bus route from your hotel you can use the paas on buses as often as you like, gets you to the wall and into museams and",
          "We hired a guide to take us on a walking tour in and around the old city, this is one of the must see attractions if interested in the history.",
          "It's a nice visit, with a few objects and information about Dubrovnik nobility. However, you might want to buy a Dubrovnik day pass (online is cheaper) and visit whatever's there - palace and city walls are included in the pass. The entrance is 150 kn, which is really not worth",
          "Lovely arches and atrium to this building, a mixture of styles of architecture because they kept storing gunpowder inside it and it would periodically blow up. That and an earthquake or two means different architects had a go at the palace, but still pleasing on the eye.",
          "Enjoyed this museum full of lots of interesting furniture and artefacts, very well preserved and well worth a visit.",
          "I was expecting a bit more of a museum. There are items to see but it doesn't really tell a story like I'd hoped. The building is nice and there is a small gift shop. You can't take a stroller, but they will mind it for you. You will recognise the stairs in the courtyard from",
          "Never seen so many sedan chairs in a museum. Lovely to wander around, and an interesting spot for an hour or so. Get a Dubrovnik card, saves money",
          "Many artifacts placed in here for the 15th century onwards. Quick 30 minute walk around the palace will be enough. Get the dubrovnik day pass!",
          "This is near the clock tower. A managed to get a good photo when not too many people were around. If there are too many people you tend not to see it properly.",
          "expecting a different type of museum. A lot of paintings and furniture. Not my cup of tea but I am sure some people love this type of museum",
          "Visited the museum as we had free entrance as part of the Dubrovnik 3 day ticket. Although not a large museum, it still proved to be very interesting, especially the \"war chests\" and recommend a visit.",
          "One of the highlights of a visit to Dubrovnik, is a visit here.. Built in the 15th centuary, consists of lovely rooms, decorated in period furniture, like a traditional stately home...,magnificent courtyard, used for scenes from Game of Thrones, plenty of interesting sedan",
          "Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to go in when we went as there was an event of some sort. However the outside part which is accessible through the thoroughfare is just stunning. The details on the columns are restored to almost perfection so we can only imagine what it",
          "It is worth visiting one museum in Dubrovnik as you get an insight into their way of life. This museum has information in English. Really interesting information and the building is lovely. Good way to see inside one of the old palaces.",
          "This building, which used to house the leader of Dubrovnik, is located on the man thoroughfare in the Old Town. The ground floor contains a beautiful courtyard and lots of art on display that showcases much of the history of both the building and the city. The upper floor is",
          "Impressive from the outside and beautiful inner courtyard (which you can see by looking in the entrance) without paying - GOT filming site. They also do regular concerts in this courtyard which I imagine would be fab. A few rooms to look round over 2 floors - quite",
          "Toured the area in June. It was so hot walking around the city. What a cool place to see and listen to the historical information.",
          "This site was undergoing Restoration during our visit. I was able to get whatever photos I could, but I was disappointed we couldn't get inside to take a better look!",
          "The palace of the ruler of Dubrovnik is a wonderful Gothic structure across from the cathedral. My favorite exhibit was the pair of bronze bell ringers (sculptures) from the 1470's. There was a nice silver collection as well as a small coin collection. One of the better museums",
          "Rectors Palace was closed for renovation during our Dubrovnik visit but the architecture is handsome, and this sight is on the path.",
          "Rector's Palace is a beautiful palace located in the Old Town of Dubrovnik. Architecture is a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance style with Baroque elements. It was built in the 15th century for the Governor (Rector) of the Republic of Dubrovnik (Ragusa). Today the palace houses",
          "The museum opened today, 7 June 17. It was nice but on the European scale it is a minor museum. Some nice items. My favorite were the copper bell ringing soldiers. The museum is on the Dubrovnik card with costs 190 Kunas. Since the tour of the city walls, a must see, is 150",
          "Unfortunately the rectors palace was closed for refurbishment during our visit but the architecture was still worthy of a visit, we managed to get glimpses of the inside through open doors whilst people were working and will be sure to visit next time we are in Dubrovnik.",
          "The Rector's Palace is located between the Town Hall and the Church of St. Blaise and is an outstanding monument of secular architecture. The day we went the building was undergoing renovation so we couldn\u2019t go inside. We still had a nice visit walking around the outside of",
          "The museum in the Rector's palace was supposed to be one of our top places to visit and the 3-day Dubrovnik card included a free entrance but it was closed due to renovation. Maybe next time.",
          "Closed because of restauration so we were disappointed. It's the only museum who seemed to be very interesting.",
          "We couldn't get in as closed for refurb, but outside architecture is good to see, it is very clean and been well looked after all these years.",
          "Lovely to look at, but unfortunately closed for renovations - got some lovely night photos of the building though and a bride was having wedding photos taken there. Expect it will be stunning when it reopens.",
          "The building had been reconstructed several times by different architects over different periods of time due to damages by earthquakes, fires, explosions etc and thus it is a mixture of the Gothic, Rennaissance and Baroque styles. It is now the home of the history department of",
          "This amazing historic building is very attractive from the outside. It has a very impressive courtyard and interesting dungeons. Great part of the building is a museum. On the first floor the exhibits are rather average. To be honest, I expected much more. The temperature was",
          "We didn't know that this place is closed for renovations until May. It is part of the Dubrovnik Card. We should have gotten a discount for not being able to see it!",
          "Its one of many attractions on Dubrovnik. If you visited Greece islands and Malta, you will not be impressed.",
          "The Rector's Palace is a museum with lots of period items to see. It's also a beautiful building inside and out.",
          "Interesting and tumultuous history. It served many purposes as the administrative centre and prison, the courthouse and the rector 's private quarters while in office. There's an interesting exhibition of chests and locks at the basement.",
          "We found this attraction to be very interesting, for the building as well as its contents. Definitely worth a look.",
          "This old building was the seat of the Rector of Dubrovnik. The architecture is a pleasing mixture of late Gothic and early Renaissance. It now houses the Cultural History Museum (entrance fee).",
          "Highlight of our visit - rare to have a full symphony orchestra in such an intimate setting. Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra were amazing - especially the featured xylophone and inspiring young conductor - with great acoustics. Not expensive for such a performance - don't miss it",
          "This building has a lot of history and was renovated numerous times over the centuries. It even has old prison cells within it. However, most of it is now a museum and the exhibits are rather average.",
          "This palace was the seat of government and home to the Rector. The palace is laid out with a stunning courtyard with a grand stairway to the public rooms on the first floor. Today, the building is a museum housing numerous collections and an assortment of period rooms",
          "This Museum is a filming location for Star Wars. Anw, this place is nice and lovely I have to say. And if you buy the ticket here, you can have another 9 museums i Dubrovnik!! Perfect for Museum Goers",
          "We end up in front of this museum after wandering about the old town streets of Dubrovnik. It was indeed a good surprise. And it is included in Dubrovnik card. The rooms are separated by steps and curiously arranged but the artifacts and cultural objects to be seen are very neat",
          "The Rector of Dubrovnik was in office for 1 month and got to live in this palace for that time. You enter through the Gothic Loggia into the Atrium with a stone staircase up to the grand rooms on the first floor. Before you go upstairs, have a look in the gloomy and dank prison",
          "While you are inside the city walls, you might as well see it, but if you've seen other medieval houses in Italy, it is a little underwhelming.",
          "Beautiful historic building, must-see in historic centre. The building is nice renovated, but always full of tourists.",
          "This is a beautiful building which houses the cultural history museum. I thought the building was more interesting than the museum, although having a rector (head of the city state) who was only in power for a month might well have been a good thing as they didn't have time to",
          "We were visiting the Cultural History Museum as part of a large group so it was a bit of a rush to see everything. Unfortunately the Museums ticket didn't allow re-entry during free time",
          "This was worth visiting, though the best part for me was the exhibition of photos from the 1991/2 siege. I thought the 100 kuna entrance fee was a little steep, but found out later that the ticket also gave entry to a number of other museums, so actually quite good value",
          "A grand facade on the Pred Dvorom that suggests what much of Dubrovnik was like before the 1667 earthquake. Home for the ancient city\u2019s premier resident, a role that passed to another on a monthly cycle.",
          "For me, the architecture of the palace was what was most special. The displays of art and artefacts were OK, but it was the exterior arches and the beautiful graceful staircase inside that I liked best.",
          "This used to be the palace for the area.Now it is a museum with a mixed collection of artefacts.I can't say that any of these were particularly interesting.However if it is on your one day card you may as well go and see it.",
          "Charming, by anyone's standards and an interesting history. The inner courtyard is lovely and a respite from the teeming crowds just outside the door. A very old pharmacy inside which is also a must see.",
          "We probably would not have gone in had it not been raining but we're glad we did. The museum is nice - not an absolute must though and really only takes about an hour. Your ticket will be good for several visits to 8 (if I remember correctly) other museums in Dubrovnik as well",
          "Visited this palace twice. While not Buckingham Palace still a very interesting building and well worth a visit. Entry is included in the Dubrovnik card which is well worth while buying to include this with the city walls. Returned to the palace again in the evening to see the",
          "We also went to the palace to watch the Dubrovnick Symphony Orchestra and it was a wonderful experience. Beautiful music , in a beautiful building on a beautiful evening.",
          "Still undergoing the final repairs after the last earthquake, this building is another site used in the Game of Thrones series. Go on a GoT tour (see my separate review on this) and you will see several sites used.",
          "If you have a chance to see the orchestra at Rector's palace it's a must. The orchestra is just amazing! You can feel their passion when they play. You just don't listen to the orchestra the orchestra Moves you. I would go again and again to see the Dubrovnik Orchestra.",
          "Small museum. With a few interesting artefacts. As many have said and without doing it a disservice it's not up to the majority of palaces/museums I have seen in other cities. Worth seeing if you have purchased as art of a multiple attraction ticket but not worth the entrance",
          "Very beautiful old palace with amazing furniture. Place where you feel so peacefull. The hands on the stairs ;)",
          "We were free to enter because we got Dubrovnik card. Without it, you need pay entrance fee of 100 kuna. The palace is not big. It is no way comparable to any palace in France or Italy. There are some exhibitions, showing some paintings, etc. The most impressive is showing",
          "Go with a guide or read about this wonderful building before you go. It's history is fascinating and the preservation marvellous. For me this was the most interesting of the wealth of things to see in Dubrovnik it also has one of the most extensive and well documented displays.",
          "Longer museum but still didn't learn much. We enjoyed the views from the windows and escaping the sun, but it was rather underwhelming. The architecture is nice, but not a must. No photos allowed.",
          "Dubrovnik is at the edge of being overwhelmed by tourism - particularly from the huge cruise ships which land a thousand tourists at a time into this lovely Renaissance city... but the Rector's Palace is cool and quiet and if there's a concert on, you're in for a treat: a",
          "We only visited as we had the Dubrovnik Card, which included free entry. Some interesting exhibits but not high on the priority list if the time is limited in the city",
          "Rector's palace is located at the end of stardun the main Street of Duronvick. Very pictures. Can't misd",
          "We bought a Dubrovnik day pass which entitled us to walk the walls and visit various museums. The Rector's Palace was undoubtedly the best museum in the city.",
          "We heard a wonderful classical guitar concert by the Dubrovnik Guitar Trio. Parts of the program included a mezzo-soprano. The concert was from 9 to 10 PM in an atrium large enough for about 100 people. There are regular concerts in this venue.",
          "nit is a good place to visit with a guide who can explain it to you. The paintings and exhibits are worth seeing.",
          "Wasn't able to go inside due to other things on the itinerary but our tour guide said it has the best interior of all buildings in the old town",
          "We visited the Rector's Palace earlier today and were very impressed with the building and its history as well as the artefacts. This is one of nine museums that you can visit in and around the old town.",
          "This is literally and figuratively on many levels. At all times labels are in Croat and English. The entrance takes in ecclesiastical art, a court room with original rail and bench and an amazing display of iron chests. On emerging into the courtyard there are some prison cells",
          "The Duke's palace was something that you really must to see. You have choise to visit like tourist and see whole palace or when was concert clasical music but then you see yust atrium. Rector's Palace is a palace in Dubrovnik was built as the seat of government and residence of",
          "As far as European palaces go, this is a very poor cousin to the extraordinary displays in other major European cities. Having said that, it's still worth a visit to view the displays of furniture and paintings that are important to the Dubrovnik region. Entry is free to holders",
          "This palace stands out as it is one of the few places that resisted the bug earthquake. It is different in architecture, and is worth the visit (Both inside and outside)",
          "This was the closest I felt I got to an actual museum, which Dubrovnik seems to struggle in providing (some of us like history and art with our seaside holiday). It sheds some, but not much, light on Dubrovnik's governance and history, and has some interesting, although not",
          "In the main square, very nice details, great photo ops, be sure to duck thru the archway as that is the Sea and great views and photos here as well",
          "We spent about an hour wandering around this palace - and while it was nice not sure if it's a MUST do. I think it depends on how much time you have in Old Town to be perfectly honest. The art and rooms are beautifully appointed and the dungeon below is pretty nice as far as",
          "nice to look around and probably the best in this town. rooms are very ornately decorated and look out for the 2 hidden prison cells on the ground floor--quite creepy to think they used to have hardened criminals there kept in the dark !!!",
          "The rector's place provides an insight into the history of Dubrovnik and is definitely worth a trip. There is a wide variety of subjects on display and both the inside and outside of the building look amazing.",
          "Myself and a friend visited using our Dubrovnik Day Card on a hot (32C) Sunday on the last day of July. Pros: -No air con, but premises are light and airy. -Great architecture. -Numerous exhibits - behind glass and on display stands. Paintings, statues, artefacts, furniture.",
          "This is a great museum where you can learn a lot about the history of Dubrovnik. It is a nice escape when it is extremely hot outside. It might be boring to little children, but it is a definite must-see.",
          "It's always interesting to visit an historical building in a foreign county and this was as expected. Several sedan chairs and Georgian architecture. The building is very attractive from the outside.",
          "The architecture here is amazing. I could sit and look at it all day. Such an interesting place to visit.",
          "It is an interesting Museum which brings close to the history of Republic Raguza. You can imagine how the Rector lived in his 1.month period. The temperature and the humidity were very high in the exhibition room, because of open windows and no air-condition. If the temperature",
          "only visit from the outside and the courtyard. A long-lasting (and probably long-overdue) renovation prevents visits from the inside. Not so well-kept. Hopefully the renovation will do the trick!",
          "A beautiful museum where you can realize how powerful, important and rich this city was once was. No first class painting or sculpture but many interesting pieces and beautiful apartments on the first floor. The medieval sculptures of the \"jacquemarts\" (automaton striking the",
          "An elected rector governed Dubrovnik for one-term, during which time he could not leave the palace without the consent of the senate. The site contains the rector\u2019s office, his private chambers, public halls, administrative offices, etc. Historical rooms contain portraits, coats",
          "I spent about an hour in here simply wandering from room to room. A highlight of my trip to the old town as it wasn't crowded. The Rector's rooms, the lockbox collection and the War Photography Exhibit were personal highlights. An adult ticket costs 100 Kuna and a student",
          "This was our second trip to Dubrovnik and we missed the Rector's Palace the first time so we made it a point to stop in and see it. It was worth it. Inside the courtyard kinda reminded us of the dorms in the Harry Potter movies. There were three stair cases and each one went",
          "The buiding outside is very nice but it is for us it is not really needed to see the small museum inside. It is not bad, but nothing really exceptional",
          "While overall an all right museum, the only part really sticking out were the two rooms full with lockbox. These by themselves are worth the visit though. Beutiful artwork and inguneity.",
          "Lovely building. I did this as part of my Dubrovnik card. There are a couple of interesting things esp the bedroom, the pharmacy and the coin collection. The staff did not smile or engage in any way. They are not friendly at all and treat tourists like something to be put up",
          "A very interesting building with some fascinating historical items on show. Some of the historical notes may not be entirely accurate.",
          "Spend time admiring this building. It has superb details which takes time to appreciate. This is without doubt , the most important building in all Dubrovnik.",
          "We were taken to the Rector's Palace by our guide who had extensive knowledge ( he himself a history scholar) about the significance of this building. It seems to have great bearing on trade and politics of this region.",
          "The Place here the Rector and his family lived. Architecture is amazing. One can see furniture from old times.",
          "I would recommend visiting the Rector's Palace especially on a rainy day. Lovely exhibits and a good way to past an hour.",
          "The inside of the palace is a museum. We purchase the Dubrovnik card so the entrance is already included.",
          "This is another site that is worth more than a passing glance as you tour the Old Town, as its architecture is superb. However, apart from the photographic opportunities it affords, the exterior is far more interesting than the interior, particularly since, when we visited in",
          "Id highly recommend the Rector's palace, it gives you a decent history of Dubrovnik, how it came to be, and how it was in its prime. I thought 100 kuna was a little pricey but if you like history and reading there's plenty in there to make it worth the price. For me the",
          "No photos or video allowed, this was a completely useless visit for us. Hostile staff as well, if you have any kind of camera in a sealed bag, they'll follow you like sharks. My recommendation: take a photo of the pretty outside wall and otherwise skip the place.",
          "As crowded as the streets of Old Town are, the attractions aren't particularly crowded inside and this was our experience with the palace. Also a good venue for concerts, although we were not able to attend any during our visit.",
          "Worth seeing if you gave a Dubrovnik card, possibly nit if you haven't. It is quite small as a museum with mainly Croatian artists of course.mThe Italian furnished rooms are worth seeing though",
          "The museum contains a selection of coins, furniture, pottery and pain't ins that were quite interesting. The real treat is the beauty of the building though.",
          "We had a look in because it was raining and our Dubrovnik card gave us free entry and it is quite an interesting museum with a wide range of exhibits from Alchemists wares to weapons, to photos of the civil war to a dungeon. You cant officially take photos which is a shame. The",
          "This is a pay to enter but it is on 3 levels and has lots of exhibits and rooms worth visiting. You will likely spend about 90 minutes here to see it all. You don't need a guide to see it but if you have one it just makes everything a bit easier to understand what you are",
          "Wonderful museum with period pieces. Architecture is as interesting as the art work. Lots of decorative arts.",
          "If you bought the one day Dubrovnik Card like we did or any other of the cards, it is included as one of the sites. If you appreciate art and history, it\u2019s worth a visit. Some of the staff there are a bit pesky though \u2013 follow you around just to make sure you are not taking",
          "If you have bought the Dubrovnik Card (135 Kuna for 1 day) you may enter for free. Otherwise entrance fee is 100 Kuna. It is a very interest construction built in different styles over several centuries. It features interesting aspects of medieval Dubrovnik. The seat of the",
          "This is more a museum than a lot of the places that we visited we used our Drubovnic We used our Dubrovnik Card which is a special tourists discount card that you can buy from the Tourist Office for one day 3 days or 7 days that includes free entrance to cultural institutions",
          "We were really disappointed with this place. It's basically an expensive portrait gallery 100kn per person. There are no audio guides to tell you what anything is, maybe a guided tour would be better? I would waste money unless you like looking at old portraits.",
          "The palace is at the end of the Main Street before the exit to the small harbor.The facade with its arches are beautiful.Unfortunately we could not enter as it was closed for renovation.",
          "So much history in the place. There is an exhibition of objects from the oldest apothecary in Europe and also an exhibition of photos from the Homeland war 1991 - 92 which includes the decorated doors of buildings that were damaged - very moving.",
          "The outside building is impressive. Inside the artifacts are as usual found around those times. Worth a visit if included in your guided tour",
          "Unfortunately quite a disappointing visit to the palace. All in all it took us about 15 minutes to get round the whole place. The exibits are predomininately not croatian and the information boards do not give very much information about either the exibits or the history of",
          "Rector's Place is not worth paying to enter but if you have bought a Dubrovnik Card it is included. The building itself is not particularly impressive and has been modernised with jarring features. The content is equally disappointing. The vast majority of the items on",
          "The first thing that stands out about the Rector's palace is definitely the entrance which has a lovely design with the arches and draws your attention as you walk around the old town. The interior itself is relatively limited though with some pieces of artwork and ornate",
          "Well worth a visit to this restored building which is quite beautiful to look at very Venetian looking.",
          "We found the building to be more impressive than the displays inside. Much of the artwork was by unknown artists and it's only claim to fame seemed to be its age. The most interesting displays were the jewellery and artifacts.",
          "This is a beautiful palace where the rector of the town had his home during the time he was elected (1 month) in the 15-th century. The palace is also housing a jail on the first floor. There are plenty of paintings in this museum and other objects and furniture. It's possible",
          "Included in the Dubrovnik card . Lovely place to soak up the atmosphere of old Dubrovnik. Building itself is probably more interesting then most of the artefacts but loved it . Attended a great concert in the evening with Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra playing Fabulous setting !",
          "We saw where GoT was filmed next to the staircase. Fantastic. A great place for history too. It was closed for refurbishment when we first came so we were delighted to see it had re opened towards the end of our stay.",
          "Although closed for restoration, the facade itself was interesting through the guide's commentary. A tour inside would, I think, be most rewarding.",
          "The outside of this historic building is graceful and interesting in the detail of the carving but unfortunately the reopening has been deferred from May 1 to June 1 (or maybe later)",
          "A beautiful building, with graceful arches, unfortunately currently not open to tourists due to reconstruction. A great place to watch the tourists go around Dubrovnik.",
          "Definitely Worth a visit, very nice informative place with some nice exhibitions, don't miss it.....",
          "This is a must see for anyone interested in Dubrovnik's history. The atrium is gorgeous. Concerts are often held here. Walk through the public rooms to see how the nobility lived during the Dubrovnik Republic.",
          "We purchase the dubrovnik card because it gave us entrance to the palace, then we find its closed. It is suppose to be magnificent, so maybe next time we visit, we will get a look.",
          "It is just a piece of history which atrracts every artistic soul. I felt all the history behing these walls. too beautiful, it is a dubrovnik must see, highly recommended!!!! Enjoy!",
          "We passed small churches nestled between tidy homes and BandB\u2019s \u2013 St. Claire\u2019s Convent, Domino Church, and St. Catherine\u2019s Convent \u2013 looking more like residences than places of worship. They each had stood the test of war and time with an almost glowing grace. Everything",
          "Fascinating insight into Dubrovnik's history, clearly demonstrating the dominance of an aristocratic caste.",
          "Fascinating architecture, both outside and the courtyard inside. Filled with history of the old republic, as it was the site of the rulers of the old Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovacka Republika) during the middle ages and beyond.",
          "Watched a wedding party sing and dance outside after the ceremony! Beautiful spot. Grab a meal at one of the many restaurants in the vicinity.",
          "The palace is just stunning! Loved it from both outside and the inside, great location for taking nice photos!",
          "A must see museum in Dubrovnik. Fascinating architecture, both outside and the courtyard inside. Filled with history of the old republic, as it was the site of the rulers of the old Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovacka Republika) during the middle ages and beyond. Site of some of the",
          "The Rector's palace is one of the major attractions in Old town Dubrovnik. It is right at the square at the opposite end of the Stradun from Onofrio's fountain. One can enter the place for a small fee.",
          "Lovely bit of history in a lovely old building. Our favourites were three old sea chests with the most amazing locking mechanism you will ever see.",
          "Dubrovnik just blew me away and Rector's Palace was another reason why. In the heart of the old town it is one of those architectural points that is just so incredibly impressive. I saw a number of wedding parties taking their photos around here too. Inside the palace is a",
          "The Rector's Palace is a Gothic and Renaissance palace located next to the town hall in the old town. Not a big relief monument, but it's a landmark visit mandatory in Dubrovnik. Like all buildings in Dubrovnik, suffered great damage from the 1667 earthquake , as well as all the",
          "We visited this palace on a chilly day. The sedan collection is worth seeing and there is an excellent gallery of war photographs in the basement. Go!",
          "A pleasant museum which has some unusual and interesting exhibits such as secure trunks, etc. Look out for the sculptured hands holding the handrail on the main staircase, they are great. Staff don\u2019t seem to have enough to do so just stand around talking loudly, even though",
          "museum is located next to the harbour and gives a good insight into the history of dubrovnik. Its worth upgrading to the dubrovnik card as it includes all municipal museums and the city walls. You get a good insight into both the palaces multi uses and the city itself",
          "Great exhibits and lots of history. We enjoyed this visit.Worth seeing during your stay in DB.The building interior is really lovely.",
          "Good displays along with existing architecture makes it a must see spot. People love the hand rail up the steps",
          "Magnificent facade and courtyard, building interior more striking than what is contains. Try to get a ticket to a night time concert - held in the open air, really the best way to appreciate your surroundings",
          "We visited the rector's palace for a concert. It made a great venue and we had a fantastic evening. :)",
          "Our 3 day Dubrovnik tourist card gave us free entrance to the Palace, it's well worth a visit, most of the writing is in Croatian and English and if you are into history you will enjoy your time in the palace.",
          "This old building, housing a variety of artefacts was, I think, overpriced at 100k. But your ticket does allow you entrance to 8 more places although some of these are not that interesting and should be kept for a rainy day or to get out of the cold!",
          "We visited the Rector's Palace as it's billed as one of the 'must do' attractions in the city. We were a little disappointed as a portion seemed to be closed and it was a little small, but the highlight was the small exhibition of war photography on the ground floor. It was a",
          "Included in the Dubrovnik one day pass if you are walking the walls as well. Some really interesting objects in here and good views from the first floor windows. The iron chests are a delight if you you're a medieaval gadget freak. Slightly disengaged ticket desk person and over",
          "There were a lot of cruise ships that came in, so this was very crowded. It was ok for a museum - not sure I would call it still a palace, but once was .",
          "There are so many wonderful places in Dubrovnk it is difficult to choose which to write about they are all worth a visit",
          "This is an absolutely stunning building but like all the Dubrovnik museums I visited the exhibitions were a little sterile although contained some interesting object.",
          "Lovely building. Fascinating collection of ancient chests from the Armada. Ancient clock mechanism, Apothecary jars, fine rooms with good views.",
          "This is a real mixture of rooms and exhibits some with furniture and artefacts plus old prison cells and a photographic gallery of the siege in tunnels below as well as some amazing ironwork on old trunks with complex locks and bolts. Well worth a visit but I could easily have",
          "beautiful even in the rain, galleries of art, old and new in some of the most beatiful buildings in the city",
          "The entrance to the Rector's was free with the one-day Dubrovnik Card. Amongst the many artifacts and photo exhibits, we particularly enjoyed the hall with the many angelic exhibits and pictures. Quite a delight! The Museum Shop offered quite a good selection of Dubrovnik",
          "The palace has a marvellous exterior and a nice shaded seating area at the front. You can use a Dubrovnik Card or buy a museum ticket (includes others) and then explore the exhibitions that offer a look at various areas of Dubrovnik's history. I found the prison cell, pharmacy",
          "It is a museum now. There are several exhibitions here and the photos of Dubrovnik old town war damage should be permanent. It's free if you have Dubrovnik card. The architecture is quite beautiful here and very quite inside. Good to escape from people.",
          "It's lovely just sitting on the wall beneath the arches you can see here and inside there are a number of things to see inc. photos of the 1991-1995 conflict. Photos housed in crypt - lovely.",
          "We sat there (sneaking beers) and people watched. It was pretty nice. We also attended a concert performed inside.",
          "The great thing about the museums in Dubrovnik is that a ticket to one includes eight others as well, so if you have a few days or more here it's worth going and seeing the museums which interest you. The ticket lasts for a week and you can enter each museum once. My favourite",
          "As a big fan of GoT, I spent time trying to find filming locations. I found many from websites and such, but still stumbled on a few that hadn't been posted. They filmed a short scene with Daenerys and the Spice Trader, the Palace being the trader's home and he comes down the",
          "We went to the Cultural History Museum with high expectations as we were promised a glimpse of the oldest pharmacy in Europe as well as stunning cloisters. However, by far the most surprising (and upsetting) part of the visit was the disgusting way that I was spoken to by a",
          "We went there with our dubrovnik card, entry is free then. Building is very nice, a lot of things to see here.",
          "The best thing about the place is the building. Don't pay \u00a310 to walk around the haphazard exhibits.",
          "We've been here for three days and done all the attractions on the Dubrovnik Card and this is in the top two. It's the place where the Rector (mayor) of Dubrovnik lived when he was in post. It now has exhibits on silverware, prison cells, posh furniture, the bell tower clock",
          "Architectonic is this building worth to see. Inside there was a good art gallery with old historic paintings and items.",
          "Lovely old building, a mix of Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic, so worth a visit, even though rather expensive. We found it interesting, especially the prison, Rector's office and audience halls..",
          "The entrance cost - \u00a310 (no seniors) is not justified by a weak exhibition of marginal merit in terms of art,pottery jewelry. (As Rough Guide rightly says - many of this town's museum are, in European terms, of limited merit - and hence over sold to tourist agencies who pass on",
          "The building looks good from the outside but doesn't do justice to the wealth of art inside. Magnificent paintings and sculptures, and at only \u00a310 entry, well worth it.",
          "it's one you should visit. The entrance fee is pretty high - 100 HRK pp but the ticket allows you to visit 8 other museums (if you have the stamina). Bummer is that no photos are allowed although that didn't stop the Chinese group that was loud and totally annoying... standing",
          "This place was great. Not the best museum I've seen but a really great look into the city's history and provides context for a lot of other sights.",
          "We visited on the Sunday afternoon using our Dubrovnik Card. It has a variety of exhibits from paintings, furniture to historical medical equipment. It is very pleasant way of spending a hour or so starting to learn about the history of the city. At the time we visited, there",
          "There is a tricky to this place, you are forced to pay 100 Kn for a ticket to 9 museums, even if you only want to go to this one. Ticket is valid for 7 days, but it is not unlikely this one will be the only one you will end up seeing, so not really fair price. The exhibitions",
          "This is a good example of a 14th-century Gothic-Renaissance building. It used to be a palace. I love the stone carvings on top of the column joining the arches. Regretfully some of the carvings are damaged. The windows with the rounded shaped glass brings character to the",
          "The beauty of this place is in the details. If you can take a moment away from the crowds and feel the atmosphere of this historic place. Even better, if you can, attend a musical evening in the courtyard - wonderful experience - the courtyard is so intimate the music vibrations",
          "The exterior of the building is very impressive (as is the rest of the old town) and so we were looking forward to seeing inside this building to get a better understanding of it's heritage. In fact it appears that the majority of the original interior decoration has been lost",
          "We purchased the museum pass to visit the palace at 100kuna which turned out to be a waste of money! The palace as a museum should be engaging and captivating so it stirs enough interest to make you want to learn all about the subject of the place you are visiting, unfortunately",
          "The entry was included in our Dubrovnik card (well worth buying as you get a 24 hour bus pass too) so we had a look around. There are lots of sedan chairs, guns, amongst other things. There was also a display of photos from the 1991 bombings which we found very interesting and",
          "We were unable to enter as it was a Sunday. The Architecture was beautiful and worth a visit! Lovely looking gardens from behind the gates. They have an old apothecary which looked like a worthwhile visit",
          "Interesting things to see here and worth spending an hour inside. The palace is near the water and the views are wonderful.",
          "It's very photogenic, especially if you go in early morning when you'll find several street cats keeping guard around it. It was designed by Michelozzo Michelozzi, the same Michelozzi responsible for design of several of the Medici Villas. I was told the inside has very limited",
          "Many interesting things to see in the rooms, sedan chairs, Venetian furnishings, Murano chandeliers, bell ringer figures, the original cells, and the exhibition of war photos was just incredible to view. Once outside again, go round to the harbour and you\u2019ll see the building is",
          "When you buy your ticket it gives you entrance to ten museums in Dubrovnik, but whilst you can see there are many staff who ensure no photographs taken. Now there may be reasons why you can't take photos of pictures on the walls and of a sedan chair, but the whole process left",
          "A very beautiful building, particularly the outside with its pillars, murals and little details everywhere! A must visit when in Old Town!",
          "Beautiful building (on the front, the back facing the harbour is left plain so that raiders to Dubrovnik didn't realise it's importance). Entry to the Palace includes entry into the many museums as well so make sure when you get your ticket you remember this. Lots of stunning",
          "It used to be residence of Rector elected every month by this tiny city state. Now housing a museum about the history.",
          "Very interesting and well worth a visit. I would recommend getting the multi use card for better value.",
          "Rector's Palace isa beutiful historic building right at the centre of Dubrovnik. Worth a visit. As it is one of the top-attractions, it can be quite crowdy inside.",
          "The Rector's Palace is an amazing architectural building, and well worth a visit! It is included in the Dubrovnik card, which is great value for money, however would be worth a visit without the card! It is fascinating to see the original cells, bell ringer figures and the",
          "It was 100 Kuna to get in and so I think given its included in the Dubrovnik card you could save money buying this! Anyway I loved this place it houses the old bell ringers Mora and Bora and is packed with history, artefacts and is so worth a visit. The Atrium is lovely and",
          "We only visited the open courtyard inside the Rector's Palace to listen to the Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra who play here during the months of August and September. It was well worth it!",
          "Impressive. It is really impressive and every time you are walking and you pass by the Rector's Palace you have to stop and take another look at it. Thrilling.",
          "Lies in the courtyard which is at the end of the Stradun. Part of the sights of Dubrovnik to see not least due to Game of Thrones . however there is more to see inside and well worth it to admire at night when floodlit",
          "Loved this attraction. Full of beautiful paintings and furniture. Interesting collection of angels. Opportunity for some great photos.",
          "A very interesting building and museum. Lots of different artefacts and works of art. A must if you are touring the old city.",
          "We had a Dubrovnik Card and visited all the included museums and I would say that besides the City Walls, this was the most interesting. Well, if you are interested in history and art. It had lots of great rooms, art, a collection of angels, even a prison to check out.",
          "The building and its history is fascinating Unfortunately unless you're into heavy baroque art you won't be too impressed with the exhibits. Photography throughout is forbidden, but you can get some nice photos of the surrounding town from the upper floors.",
          "We visited as part of a Game of Thrones tour as it was closing which was kind of staff. Really pretty and a great spot for pictures.",
          "Tickets are 100kuna each however this ticket will get you into the Ethnographic Museum, House of Marin Drzic, Dubrovnik Natural History Museum, Maritime Museum, Archaelogical Exhibition, Dulcic Masks Pulitika Gallery, Museum of Modern Art and Studio Pulitika. You might aswell",
          "The museum is nice, and I enjoyed seeing the exhibits. However, I was more impressed by the Franciscan and Dominican monasteries and the small museums attached to them, so would recommend visiting those instead.",
          "We visited the Rector's Palace after walking the city walls, as it is included on the Dubrovnik card and is mainly indoor, so you can escape from the midday sun! The story of the Rector is an interesting one and there are quite a few artefacts from the era, with descriptions in",
          "The building was very beautiful, and there was plenty to take the interest of our 6 yr old. We hunted out the dragon at the dragon prison cell, we tried to read the pharmacy jars, we enjoyed looking at all the angels. There are lovely views from the windows and we liked looking",
          "Definitely go and explore the Rector's Palace. It's right in downtown old town and worth seeing. Lots of history here",
          "A beautiful yet stark building, the Rector's Palace was used for some interior scenes from Game of Thrones!",
          "you got to try the ice cream, fabulous! try the cafe on the corner opposite side of the road to the supermarket, good service and reasonable prices. bus station in market square to go to dubrovnik etc",
          "[See review of the Palace in Dubrovnik] The other name of the Rector's Palace is Sponza Palace (a word that comes from the Latin 'spongia') also explained at Dubrovnik's review.",
          "This is a beautiful building in the Old Town of Dubrovnik. Some interesting exhibits such as the treasure chests. The central courtyard is very attractive.",
          "The Rector's Palace is a superb Gothic & Renaissance building in central Dubrovnik near the Bell Tower & St. Blaise Church. The facade reminds of Venice. Besides its many sculptures, there is also a great wall painting on the right hand side. Its courtyard is also magnificent.",
          "This is the Rector's Palace which dominates the wide street at the end of the main entrance street. There are 9 museums or exhibits in the old town which can be visited by purchasing one ticket. Get the ticket marked off at each place to be able to visit each one once. Lots",
          "The architecture was good and amazed to find inside a walled city, very clean think you are in a film set.",
          "This was a great venue and beautiful. We bought tickets at the cultural center the night before. Although it is open air, you can't hear any of the noise outside. It was 30degrees Celsius in the evening and we were hot! Performers were amazing, but we had to leave at",
          "This place is great example of the local architecture. It was good to wander through and read about some of the lical history. There was also a photo exhibition about the croatian war. Good to pass some time and learn a bit about the area.",
          "We used our 24 hour Dubrovnik Card to enter this attraction for \"free\" (otherwise 70 kuna). Our 15 minute walk through the 3 to 4 spacious, bright and airy rooms allowed us to see the living quarters of a wealthy family of Dubrovnik. Around the perimeter of some of the rooms",
          "A combination of great building - one we had passed a few times from the outside. But it was on our list to visit, and the impressive entrance was matched by the variety of things to see inside. We found ourselves learning more about the Ragusan republic the longer we stayed in",
          "Art works and artefacts, old dungeons the kids could explore and a fascinating and poignant photo exhibit of the 1990s conflict. Purchased the 9 visit multi museum ticket valid for a week. Perfect for dipping in to different venues and escaping the sun and heat.",
          "Nice palace. Recommend getting the Dubrovnik tourist card aka Dubrovnik Card. Has nice pieces on the upper floors and a former prison below.",
          "OK, this review is really based on the experience we had when we first arrived. The courtyard is beautiful but when we tried to purchase tickets they only take Croatian currency (Kuna)! They do not take credit cards or Euro which is incredible because everywhere else does.",
          "The Rector's Palace also known as the Knezev Dvor. This is close to the Town Hall formerly the palace of the Major Council. This a large outstanding monument of secular architecture in the whole of the Adriatic coast. It is now the Cultural History Museum. Payment to enter",
          "If you are museum lover don't miss it, along Stradun and a reminder of the city's independence, nice place to visit and walk along during night time.",
          "We visited the Palace as part of our seven day Dubrovnik visitors card and got in free. I think the cost is 100 kn but there is a lot to see inside. All the rooms are laid out in period furniture painting etc and show the history of Dubrovnik. We were lucky to buy tickets to see",
          "Definitely worth a visit as the building and the contents tell you so much about the city and its governance. Also of interest is a collection of photographs taken during the 'Homeland War' that show how the citizens of Dubrovnik suffered in this conflict (this exhibition is",
          "The Rectors Palace is actually in Dubrovnik old town not Cavtat. The picture shown does not show anything in Cavtat. The palace is not very big but is worth a visit especially as the ticket covers 8 museams in Dubrovnik old town. The annoying thing about all the museams is they",
          "Lots to see here and well worth it, especially if you are able to have a guide. Our guide asked us if we wanted to see the small exhibit on the war of independence. Very sad, all the more because our guide had been a teenager at the time and was hunkered down in Dubrovnik with",
          "Check it off your list and do the tour. The guide provided an additional historical perspective to Dubrovnik. The tour complemented the tour of the wall. It rained so we bought a ticket that allowed entrance to several sites. Definitely worth it.",
          "A nice place to visit. Some cool history and artifacts on display. A worthwhile visit, especially on a hot day.",
          "Brought the Dubrovnik card for the wall and with this and a bus to the 'new' town it paid for itself. Was interesting to see, but not worth the money if you just paid for it.",
          "A very interesting building with great outlooks out onto the main square. An interesting walk through the history of the building and Dubrovnik. Was actually blown up twice as also the gun powder store. After 2nd time they sensibly moved it. Worth a visit.",

        "wiki": "The Assumption Cathedral (Croatian: Katedrala Velike Gospe, Katedrala Marijina Uznesenja) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It is the seat of the Diocese of Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cathedral was built on the site of several former cathedrals, including 7th, 10th and 11th century buildings, and their 12th century successor in the Romanesque style. The money to build the basilica was partially contributed by the English king Richard the Lion Heart, as a votive for having survived a shipwreck near the island of Lokrum in 1192 on his return from the Third Crusade.This building was largely destroyed in the earthquake of 1667. The Senate of Dubrovnik appealed to the Italian architect Andrea Bufalini of Urbino, who sent a model for the new church in Baroque style with a nave, two aisles and a cupola. Several other Italian architects including Francesco Cortese (present from 1669 until his death in 1670), Paolo Andreotti of Genoa (present 1671-1674), Pier Antonio Bazzi of Genoa (present 1677-78), and friar Tommaso Napoli of Palermo (present 1689 - 1700), all working with local and imported stonemasons, completed the Cathedral over the next three decades. Napoli made several crucial changes to the original plans including the use of a cross vault and the opening of large thermal windows at the upper level. This gives the whole interior a lighter and brighter feel. The style of the Cathedral is in keeping with the esthetics of Roman Baroque architecture as practiced by Bernini, Carlo Fontana and their 17th century contemporaries. The construction began in 1673. The building was finished in 1713 by the Dubrovnik architect Ilija Kati\u010di\u0107.The building was damaged by the 1979 Montenegro earthquake, requiring several years of repairs.The cathedral was damaged by at least one shell during the Siege of Dubrovnik in 1991. The damage has since been repaired.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe portal of the facade is flanked by four Corinthian columns. On top of the central part is a large Baroque window with a triangular gable and a balustrade with statues of saints. The deep niches in the facade contains statues of Saint Blaise (patron saint of Dubrovnik) and Joseph with Child. The lateral sides of the cathedral are rather plain, articulated by pillars and semicircular windows. The side entrances are smaller than the frontal portal.\nThe building features a high nave, separated by massive columns from the two aisles, three apses and a grand Baroque dome at the intersection of the nave and the transepts. The main altar holds a polyptych by Titian, portraying a version of the Assumption of the Virgin. This painting probably dates from 1552; the side altars hold paintings of Italian and Dalmatian masters of later centuries.\n\n\n== Treasury ==\nThe Cathedral treasury (Riznica Katedrale) shows clearly the numerous connections Dubrovnik had with the main seaports in the Mediterranean Sea. The treasury holds 182 reliquaries holding relics from the 11th to 18th centuries; from local masters, Byzantium, Venice and the Orient. Its most important object is the gold-plated arm, leg and skull of Saint Blaise (patron saint of Dubrovnik). The head is in the shape of a crown of Byzantine emperors, adorned with precious stones and enameled medals. The treasury holds also a relic of the True Cross. Other outstanding examples in the treasury are a number of church vessels (13th to 18th century), many of them manufactured by local goldsmiths, and a number of valuables, such as the Romanesque-Byzantine icon of Madonna and Child (13th century) and paintings, among others, by Padovanini, Palma il Giovane, Savoldo, Parmigianino and P. Bordone.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDubrovnik, history, culture, art heritage by Antun Travirka; Forum, Zadar, 2014; ISBN 978-953-179-884-6\nThe Cathedral Treasury\nVe\u017ei\u0107, Pavu\u0161a (2014). \"Ikonografija romani\u010dke katedrale u Dubrovniku\".

          "My wife and I had a short stop off in Dubrovnik whilst on a TUI cruiser and enjoyed the visit. The cathedral is quite small (well as far as cathedral normally go) but is a true delight. Free to enter, is contains several paintings and some important relics.",
          "We visited Dubrovnik for the first time with the intention of taking a self-guided tour of the city from our cruise ship which was docked in the nearby port. We had done some preparation before we arrived but armed with a tourist map we set out to see as much of the historic",

          "I\u2019m generally not a fan of church buildings especially catholic kinds. This one I had to go look for myself, since it was supposedly erected by Richard the Lionheart. It was a terrible disappointment however since it was not the original Romanesque. What\u2019s here looks more",
          "I had only a short time, but the cathedral seemed plain and not so memorable considering Dubrovnik was quite wealthy. I found the outside and the square in front to be mush more impressive than the interior.",

          "This was my first sightseeing stop in Dubrovnik and I was delighted to be greeted with a grand yet simple space with sacred art ranging from 17th century marble statuary to a very contemporary installation of the stations of the cross. The rebuilt church is on a site that\u2019s",

          "It is noticeable that six different architects -most of them Italians- worked on realizing this cathedral. Especially Napoli 1689 - 1700 made signifcant changes to the original design by inserting big windows at the upper levels permitting more light inside the main structure.",

Due to the size there\u2019s not an awful lot to see here so we found ourselves only spending about 10 minutes inside.",

          "This cathedral is not going to blow your mind like the ones you see in some capitals around the world, but it's worth a visit for sure. The architecture is quite nice and fits well with it's surroundings. It has 2 entrees, a main one and one to the side. There's a small square",
          "The exterior of this church is lovely especially the lantern dome. It fits in perfectly with the general medieval fabric of the Old Town of Dubrovnik very well. I, personally, was less keen on the flamboyant baroque interior but interesting to visit.",
          "Dubrovnik Cathedral, rebut in the seventeenth century following a devastating earthquake is one of the many sites of history which is a must to see whilst visiting beautiful Dubrovnik.",
          "There are many finer Cathedrals around the world but this one is part of Dubrovnik and is worth a visit. A mixture of basic and ornate but part of the fabric of this impressive place.",
          "I think every church you go into, especially these really old ones have a unique history to tell. This one is pretty simple but quaint. If you're in Old Town it's worth a quick look.",
          "Not an impressive cathedral considering that most of the population in Croatia is Catholic and how old the city is. Overall a nice quiet place for praying but it doesn\u2019t have the feel of the age of the city inside.",
          "The Cathedral visit was one of many highlights during our walking tour. The original Cathedral was built in the 6th or 7th centuries and was of Byzantine design. During the 12th and 14th centuries it was rebuilt in Romanesque style. This structure was largely destroyed during",
          "This was much smaller than I had expected, and impossibly crowded. But the most striking things for me were the Stations of the Cross, modern sculptural reliefs mounted on the pillars, I cannot find any more information about them but they were so interesting that I forgot",
          "Although it's no match for cathedrals in Italy, this one has a nice painted ceiling and some lovely marble in the side chapels, including one inlaid altar and another a blend of ivory and violet. This small cathedral is definitely worth at least a brief look.",
          "The Old Cathedral is an OK mid-sized medieval church with some interesting artifacts but not more exceptional than a dozen other cathedrals in Europe. On the down side, Dubrovnik's old city is always jammed with cruise ship day tourists. I recommend spending no more than two",
          "It's a small cathedral and near the Luza Square. Intricate interiors and free to enter. Would recommend a visit if your re at the square which is a must see",
          "This is a fine building with some splendid fresco work and some pleasing contemporary artwork - if you're into churches, it's worth a visit but my preference would be the church of St. Blaise with its superb stained glass.",
          "It was nice to escape some of the crowds outside for this cool quiet space. An attractive building and also I found staff inside friendly too when asking about taking photos. It wasn't asked for but I was happy to make a small donation.",
          "Next to St Blaise Church, this one is much larger and just as impressive, featuring an impressive array of paintings and the usual array of niches and windows etc.",
          "It was so incredibly special to get married in a church with so much history. The Dubrovnik Cathedral dates all the way back to the 600s! My husband and I don't have any ties in Croatia, but we absolutely fell in love with Dubrovnik the first time we visited and decided to have",
          "Ticks all the boxes when visiting an old cathedral. Very ornate and peaceful environment. Worth a quick visit when visiting the old town. Art work and stained glass windows are stunning.",
          "The cathedral is next door to St Blaise church so is well worth a visit. It is also known as church of the Assumption. Beautifully decorated interior and spectacular alter and ceiling. The artwork is amazing so i was able to get some good photographs. Worth a visit if you are in",
          "The cathedral is located at the end of the Stradun. We were there in the evening and it was nicely lit.",

          "Have seen many cathedrals across Europe, this one is worth spending time in and complements the city of Dubrovnik. Can clearly see the Venetian influence across the whole city.",
          "Built after the former byzantine and romanesque cathedral destroyed in the great earthquake of 1667, this masterpiece of baroque art was constructed between 1671 and 1713. The architect was Andrea Buffalini of Urbino. Among other there is a painting by famous Italian painter",
          "not really one of those big and impressive cathedrals. I actually thought it was very empty and sad. Didn't like it",
          "I thought the cathedral would be a bit better looked after. It is quite impressive once inside, but a bit run down on the outside. The treasury and crypt are apparently worth a visit, but don't worry if you give this place a miss.",
          "This cathedral is thd seat of Diocese in Dubrovnik. This cathedral was built in stages between 7th and 10th century. Original building was mostly destroyed in a devastating earthquake in mid 17th century and was rebuilt. The facade has beautiful columns. Statue of Saint Blaise",
          "Simple design inside though i've heard the treasury and crypt are great although we didn't visit. Cool peaceful space which is frill free but calm. Nice atmosphere and interesting stained glass windows but not a huge amount to see. Lovely external architecture.",
          "Seriously ordinary as cathedrals in significant cities goes. The cathedral is poorly presented and maintained. It needs serious money spent on it and a significant renovation. There weren't many places in Dubrovnik that were disappointing but this was definitely one of them.",
          "Just a cathedral, a little on the small side. Nothing spectacular- if you're walking past you can stick your head in the door- if you don't you're not missing out",
          "While looking at Dubrovnik churches online prior to our visit here, it was confusing to figure out the various churches and their correct names. This is the Catholic Cathedral in Dubrovnik, called the Assumption Cathedral, on Luza Square. I have also seen it referred as the",
          "Not as great as some of the ones I have seen aroung the world, but ok.. lovely altar and organ.. But pay extra to visit the treasury",
          "Visit the treasury, the crypt, the bell tower (quite a walk up) and the baptistery. All in all takes 2 or 3 hours. .One of the main things to do in the Old Town.",
          "We visit cathedrals, and while not a French or Italian cathedral, we do recommend a short and pleasant visit.",
          "Have been twice to this small cathedral, first time it was busy, full of people and difficult to enjoy and appreciate, second was another experience. Signs on the door ask for quiet, no photographs, no smoking and this was beyond the comprehension and ability of most visitors.",
          "The Roman Catholic Church in Croatia represents about 90% of the population. However, the cathedral was empty on a Sunday morning. I was the sole visitor and only a nun was sweeping the floor. Flooded in light and very simple in decoration. History related to Richard the",
          "We have visited many Catholic Churches in cities across several countries. The one in Dubrovnic is not one that will stand out. It was a pleasant experience, but it is not a large Cathedral. There are several side altars and confessionals, but nothing to set it apart.",

        "wiki": "The Franciscan Church and Monastery is a large complex belonging to the Order of the Friars Minor. It consists of a monastery, a church, a library and a pharmacy. It is situated at the Placa, the main street of Dubrovnik, Croatia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest monastery was built in the 13th century outside the walls. A new monastery inside the walls and close to the Pile Gate, was built in 1317, but its construction took centuries. Parts of the complex were rebuilt several times.\nThe church was destroyed by the earthquake of 1667. Amongst the losses was a statue by Pietro di Martino da Milano. The only element remaining is the decorated portal overlooking the beginning of the Placa, the main street of Dubrovnik. It was sculpted in 1498 in Gothic style by the workshop of the brothers Leonard and Petar Petrovi\u010b. The almost life-sized Piet\u00e0 in the central lunette, decorated with flamboyant leaves, is flanked by the figures of St. Jerome (holding a model of the pre-earthquake church) and St. John the Baptist. On top of the lunette stands the figure of the Father Creator. The interior of the church was reconstructed in Baroque style with a single nave. The marble pulpit survived the earthquake of 1667. The main altar with the statue of the resurrected Christ between four twisted marble columns was created by the sculptor Celia from Ancona in 1713. The five side altars were sculpted by the Venetian Giuseppe Sardi between 1684 and 1696. The decorations on the altar of St. Francis were painted in 1888 by the painter Celestin Medovic. The poet Ivan Gunduli\u0107 is buried in this church.\nThe monastery was built in 1360 in late Romanesque style by the master Mihoje Brajkov of Bar.  The monastery contains two cloisters. The upper cloister was built in Renaissance style, with arches and semicircular vaults. The lower cloister was built in Romanesque-Gothic style with arches, 120 columns and 12 massive pilasters and a promenade. The capitals on the colonnade of double, ornamented  hexaphoras are all different showing various geometric, plant-, human- and animal-like figures.\nThe library (built in the 17th century) contains over 20,000 books, among them 1200 valuable old manuscripts, 137 incunables,  seven books with old church corals and the inventory of the old Friars Minor Pharmacy from 1317. The museum library also contains an exhibition of liturgical artifacts, including a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem and some paintings of old masters, such as \"Ecce Homo\" by Francesco Raibolini, also known as Francesco Francia (15th century) and a 14th-century head relic of St Ursula.\nThe pharmacy dates from 1317 and is the oldes still functioning pharmacy in the Europe and the third oldest in the world.\nThe library and the bell tower were damaged during the 1991 war.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nFranciscan Monastery - Dubrovnik\nFranciscan Monastery Museum\nDubrovnik, history, culture, art heritage by Antun Travirka; Forum, Zadar, 2014; ISBN 978-953-179-884-6",

        "wiki": "Blaise of Sebaste (Armenian: \u054d\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0562 \u054e\u056c\u0561\u057d\u056b, Soorp Vlasi; Greek: \u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Agios Vlasios) was a physician and bishop of Sebastea in historical Armenia (modern Sivas, Turkey) who is venerated as a Christian saint and martyr. \nBlaise is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches and is the patron saint of wool combers and throat disease. In the Latin Church, his feast falls on 3 February, in the Eastern Churches on 11 February. According to the Acta Sanctorum, he was martyred by being beaten, attacked with iron combs, and beheaded.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe first reference to Blaise is the medical writings of A\u00ebtius Amidenus (ca. AD 500) where his aid is invoked in treating objects stuck in the throat.\nMarco Polo reported the place where \"Messer Saint Blaise obtained the glorious crown of martyrdom\", Sebastea; the shrine near the citadel mount was mentioned by William of Rubruck in 1253. However, it appears to no longer exist.\n\n\n== Life ==\nFrom being a healer of bodily ailments, Saint Blaise became a physician of souls, then retired for a time to a cavern where he remained in prayer. As bishop of Sebastea, Blaise instructed his people as much by his example as by his words, and the great virtues and sanctity of the servant of God were attested by many miracles. From all parts, the people came flocking to him for the cure of bodily and spiritual ills. He is said to have healed animals (who came to the saint on their own for his assistance) and to have been assisted by animals.\nIn 316, the governor of Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia Agricolaus began a persecution by order of the Emperor Licinius and Saint Blaise was seized. After his interrogation and a severe scourging, he was hurried off to prison, and subsequently beheaded.\nBHO 183; BHG 276-277, BHL 1370-1389\n\n\n== The Acts of St. Blaise ==\n\nThe legendary Acts of St. Blaise were written 400 years after his death, and are apocryphal and, perhaps, fictional.The legend is as follows:\n\nBlaise, who had studied philosophy in his youth, was a doctor in Sebaste in Armenia, the city of his birth, who exercised his art with miraculous ability, good-will, and piety.  When the bishop of the city died, he was chosen to succeed him, with the acclamation of all the people.  His holiness was manifest through many miracles: from all around, people came to him to find cures for their spirit and their body; even wild animals came in herds to receive his blessing.  In 316, Agricola, the governor of Cappadocia and of Lesser Armenia, having arrived in Sebastia at the order of the emperor Licinius to kill the Christians, arrested the bishop.  As he was being led to jail, a mother set her only son, choking to death of a fish-bone, at his feet, and the child was cured straight away.  Regardless, the governor, unable to make Blaise renounce his faith, beat him with a stick, ripped his flesh with iron combs, and beheaded him.\n\n\n== The blessing of St. Blaise ==\n\nAccording to the Acts, while Blaise was being taken into custody, a distraught mother, whose only child was choking on a fishbone, threw herself at his feet and implored his intercession. Touched at her grief, he offered up his prayers, and the child was cured. Consequently, Saint Blaise is invoked for protection against injuries and illnesses of the throat.\nIn many places on the day of his feast the blessing of St. Blaise is given: two candles (sometimes lit), blessed on the feast of the Presentation of the Lord (Candlemas), are held in a crossed position by a priest over the heads of the faithful or the people are touched on the throat with them. At the same time the following blessing is given: \"Through the intercession of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr, may God deliver you from every disease of the throat and from every other illness\". Then the priest makes the sign of the cross over the faithful.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nAs the governor's hunters led Blaise back to Sebastea, on the way, the story goes, they met a poor woman whose pig had been seized by a wolf. At the command of Blaise, the wolf restored the pig to its owner, alive and unhurt. When he had reached the capital and was in prison awaiting execution, the old woman whose pig he had saved came to see him, bringing two fine wax candles to dispel the gloom of his dark cell. In the West there was no group honoring St. Blaise prior to the eighth century.\n\n\n== Cult of Saint Blaise ==\n\nOne of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, Blaise became one of the most popular saints of the Middle Ages. His followers became widespread in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries and his legend is recounted in the 13th-century Legenda Aurea. Saint Blaise is the saint of the wild beast.\nHe is the patron of the Armenian Order of Saint Blaise. In Italy he is known as San Biagio. In Spanish-speaking countries, he is known as San Blas, and has lent his name to many places (see San Blas). Several places in Portugal and Brazil are also named after him, where he is called S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s (see S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s).\nIn Italy, Saint Blaise's remains rest at the Basilica over the town of Maratea, shipwrecked there during Leo III the Isaurian's iconoclastic persecutions.\nMany German churches, including the former Abbey of St. Blasius in the Black Forest and the church of Balve are dedicated to Saint Blaise/Blasius.\n\n\n=== In Great Britain ===\nIn Cornwall the town of St Blazey and the civil parish of St Blaise derive from his name, where the parish church is still dedicated to Saint Blaise. The council of Oxford in 1222 forbade all work on his festival.\nThere is a church dedicated to Saint Blaise in the Devon hamlet of Haccombe, near Newton Abbot,  one at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight and another at Milton near Abingdon in Oxfordshire, one of the country's smallest churches.  It is located next to Haccombe house which is the family home of the Carew family, descendants of the vice admiral on board  the Mary Rose at the time of her sinking.  This church, unusually, retains the office of \"archpriest\".There is a St. Blaise's Well In Bromley, London  where the water was considered to have medicinal virtues. St Blaise is also associated with Stretford in Lancashire. A Blessing of the Throats ceremony is held on February 3 at St Etheldreda's Church in London and in Balve, Germany.\nIn Bradford, West Yorkshire a Roman Catholic middle school named after St Blaise was operated by the Diocese of Leeds from 1961 to 1995.  The name was chosen due to the connections of Bradford to the woollen industry and the method that St Blaise was martyred, with the woolcomb. Due to reorganisation the school closed down when Catholic middle schools were phased out, and the building was sold to Bradford Council to provide replacement accommodation for another local middle school which had burned down.  Within a few months, St Blaise school was also severely damaged in a fire, and the remains of the building were demolished.  A new primary school was built on the land, and most of the extensive grounds were sold off for housing.\n\nThere is a 14th-century wall painting of St Blaise in All Saints Church, Kingston upon Thames, located by the market place, marking the significance of the wool trade in the economic expansion of the market town in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n\n=== In Croatia ===\nSaint Blaise (Croatian: Sveti Vlaho or Sveti Bla\u017e) is the patron saint of the city of Dubrovnik and formerly the protector of the independent Republic of Ragusa. At Dubrovnik his feast is celebrated yearly on 3 February, when relics of the saint, his head, a bit of bone from his throat, his right hand and his left, are paraded in reliquaries. The festivities begin the previous day, Candlemas, when white doves are released. Chroniclers of Dubrovnik such as Rastic and Ranjina attribute his veneration there to a vision in 971 to warn the inhabitants of an impending attack by the Venetians, whose galleys had dropped anchor in Gru\u017e and near Lokrum, ostensibly to resupply their water but furtively to spy out the city's defenses. St. Blaise (Blasius) revealed their pernicious plan to Stojko, a canon of St. Stephen's Cathedral. The Senate summoned Stojko, who told them in detail how St. Blaise had appeared before him as an old man with a long beard and a bishop's mitre and staff. In this form the effigy of Blaise remained on Dubrovnik's state seal and coinage until the Napoleonic era.\n\n\n=== In Iceland ===\nSaint Blaise (Icelandic: Blas\u00edus) was prominent in Iceland, in particular Southwestern Iceland, where he was known for his purported miracle-working powers. Saint Blaise is mentioned in \u00deorl\u00e1ks saga helga, an Icelandic saga about Thorlak Thorhallsson, the patron saint of Iceland.\n\n\n=== Blaise and Blasius of Jersey ===\nIn England in the 18th and 19th centuries Blaise was adopted as mascot of woolworkers'  pageants, particularly in Essex, Yorkshire, Wiltshire and Norwich. The popular enthusiasm for the saint is explained by the belief that Blaise had brought prosperity (as symbolised by the Woolsack) to England by teaching the English to comb wool. According to the tradition as recorded in printed broadsheets, Blaise came from Jersey, Channel Islands. Jersey was certainly a centre of export of woollen goods (as witnessed by the name jersey for the woollen textile). However, this legend is probably the result of confusion with a different saint, Blasius of Caesarea (Caesarea being also the Latin name of Jersey).\n\n\n== Iconography ==\nIn iconography, Blaise is represented holding two crossed candles in his hand (the Blessing of St. Blaise), or in a cave surrounded by wild beasts, as he was found by the hunters of the governor. He is often shown with the instruments of his martyrdom, steel combs. The similarity of these instruments of torture to wool combs led to his adoption as the patron saint of wool combers in particular, and the wool trade in general. He may also be depicted with crossed candles. Such crossed candles are used for the blessing of throats on his feast day, which falls on 3 February, the day after Candlemas on the General Roman Calendar. Blaise is traditionally believed to intercede in cases of throat illnesses, especially for fish-bones stuck in the throat.\n\n\n== Relics ==\nThere are multiple relics of Blaise in a variety of churches and chapels, including multiple whole bodies, at least four heads and several jaws, at least eight arms, and so on:\n\nWith a little research, we would find Saint Blaise armed with a hundred arms, like the giant of the fable. The fingers, teeth, feet of this voluminous saint are too scattered for us to undertake to bring them together.\n\n\u2014 Collin de Plancy, 1822\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlessing of the Throats\nOrder of Saint Blaise\nSan Biagio (disambiguation)\nSaint Blaise, patron saint archive\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSaint Blaise article from Catholic.org\nHieromartyr Blaise of Sebaste\nSt. Blaise's life in Voragine's Golden Legend: Latin original and English (English from the Caxton translation)\nSaint Blaise at the Christian Iconography web site.\nNovena in Honor of St. Blaise",

        "wiki": "Christopher Anderson (born 1970) is an American photographer. He is a member of Magnum Photos.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAnderson was born in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. He grew up in the west Texas town of Abilene.\n\n\n== Career ==\nChristopher Anderson first gained recognition for his pictures in 1999 when he boarded a small wooden boat with Haitian refugees trying to sail to America. The boat, named the \"Believe In God\", sank in the Caribbean. In 2000 the images from that journey received the Robert Capa Gold Medal.\nAnderson's early work from conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Israel/ Palestine earned international acclaim and awards such as two World Press Photo Awards and Magazine Photographer of the Year.\nIn 2004, Anderson began traveling to Venezuela to document the country under the presidency of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The resulting book, Capitolio (RM 2009) was named one of the best photographic books of 2010 at the Kassels book Festival in Germany. In 2011, Anderson made Capitolio into an app for iPhone and iPad, the first photographic book to be made into an application for such devices. His current work crosses genres, from documentary to art to portraiture of celebrities (such as Lady Gaga) and fashion.\nAnderson was one of the early members of the VII Photo Agency that was formed by photographers James Nachtwey and Anton\u00edn Kratochv\u00edl in 2001. He resigned from the agency in 2004 and joined Magnum Photos in 2005. He has served as a contract photographer for Newsweek and National Geographic magazines and is currently the first \"Photographer in Residence\" at New York Magazine, working with editors Adam Moss and Jody Quon.\n\n\n== Books ==\nNonfiction.

          "Terrific visit of this exhibit on two floors demonstrating the futility of war through different conflicts including Vietnam and here in Dubrovnik during independence. Very interesting facts, take the time to read the stories, that's where it all makes sense. Between 1 and 2",
          "This is a unique museum of amazing and harrowing pictures of the damage sustained by the old town in the war. It will give you an understanding of the very difficult times that most adults in the city can still remember and an appreciation of the herculean efforts it must",
          "I remember when this museum opened. I am so pleased it still opens it doors to visitors. It will give you a view into the war and thr photographs you will find, speak for themselves. It is an eloquent reminder of a very signigicant part of history.",
          "We found this by chance, and it's hard to say just how moving I found it. This piece of history is just so close, and attaching names and faces to this conflict is an incredibly moving experience.",
          "I visited this rate and unusual Museum that displays photographic exhibits by renowned photojournalists who covered recent and earlier regional and global conflicts. It's commendable that these photographers risking their lives and career captured such traumatic and frightening",
          "Not a \"fun\" experience, but a very emotional one, that we would recommend to anyone- some great images and stories captured, heart-breaking to see glimpses of so many conflicts of the last 50 years- this is a must see antidote to Nationalism and Populism",
          "Visited this today with my wife. Was extremely impressed. The war photography is very powerful, but the exhibit on the Balkans is excellent. Listened (probably shouldn\u2019t have) to Wade Goddard do a talk to a paying tour and he was brilliant. Amazingly informative from somebody",
          "The exhibition is heartbreaking and truthful - it shows you the darkness in humans and how the innocent forever pay the awful price. It really hit me in the heart looking at these photos saying that I felt it was important to go and see. You will come out of it feeling emotional",
          "THese images tell the truth behind the propaganda or media lies about what war does to the people involved and affected. It's a serious waste of life, energy and money but at least you get to understand a little better when you have not been exposed to these atrocities as other",
          "Recommended as one of the top attractions in Dubrovnik, a visit here was a pleasant escape from the crowded Old Town streets. The gallery is modern and located over two floors. The only drawback is that the building doesn't have bathrooms. It is also not wheelchair accessible",
          "The War Photo Limited exhibition is a real eye opener and truly heartbreaking at the same time. If you want to experience more than just the tourist hotspots and learn about the brutality of the recent Yugoslavian war then this exhibition is worth visiting.",
          "A thought provoking, well laid out museum, that highlights the dark side of humanity. The display regarding Vietnam is hard hitting but is respectfully done. I learnt so much about the former Yugoslavia and it's break up. Always the innocent who suffer the greatest loss. The",
          "War photos from conflicts around the world, especially Vietnam now. Would have been nice to have more photos from the Balkan wars in the 1990s.",
          "I travelled on a rainy day from cavtat especially to see this exhibition. It was thought provoking and disturbing. The receptionist was friendly. They sell lots of photography books on different wars and lots of the photos on display are for sale although personally I wouldn\u2019t",
          "The poor girl at the counter - loads of people arriving all smiles and laughter... and leaving with damp red eyes. A must-see if you care about humanity",
          "Though provoking exhibit showing the horror and humanity of war. Moves me and makes me sick at the same time. Ashamed to be a human. Don't miss this.",
          "This museum had excellent quality exhibitions at the time I visited, Tim Page's Vietnam and the permanent Yugoslavia break up exhibitions, both worth seeing. I ended up wanting to know more about both topics. Definetely recommended as reminder that Dubrovnik is more than",
          "This museum felt out of place in touristy, beachy Dubrovnik, but refreshingly so. It was a poignant and stark reminder of the atrocities this region has faced and it was something I appreciated being able to see during my time here. The photos are beautiful, the book of",
          "While it's difficult to put into the proper context, this is an exhibit that really needs to be experienced by all visitors to better appreciate what the proud Croatian people have dealt with to be where they are now...",
          "It's not the kind of subject matter where you would say you \"enjoyed\" your visit but it is certainly worth taking the time to see it.",
          "I am very proud of having been there. A visit in Dubrovnik wouldn't be complete without a stop there. The musuem shows photos from Vietnam and the most recent conflicts. It is very well organized although the English translation is often quite poor. Nevertheless it is highly",
          "Interesting and heart wrenching photos depicting both the Vietnam war and recent Balkans war take first hand by photo journalists. Well worth a visit.",
          "Photographs of war are not easy, but these tell stories in ways that words never can - and they are by award winning photographers. At a time of so much strife, it is important to see the reality of war.",
          "Ok, so this not the cheeriest thing to do in Dubrovnik but it is certainly one of the most important things to do whilst you are here. To really understand the wars following the break up of Yugoslavia, the gallery intersperses well written text with harrowing images from the",
          "On a trip earlier in the week to Old Town, I had checked out the location of the exhibiton and also found out there was a small fee, 50 kunas if I am remebering correctly. It is on a street leading off Stradun and up a flight of stairs. The first part of the exhibition is all",
          "Fantastic experience at this war photo museum. The museum itself is modern, well air conditioned and well laid out. Lots to see- an emotional journey through a number of different wars in photographs. A great way to spend 45 mins/1 hour out of the heat of Dubrovnik!",
          "Thought provoking, sometimes harrowing, but altogether a fascinating and interesting group of exhibitions by incredibly talented photographers. So glad we visited.",
          "While not on the main tourist trail, I really recommend visiting. It is not easy to find being up a side street and is not part of the Dubrovnik card scheme. Entry in 50 Kunas. The exhibit is on 3 floors and well laid out and narrated. However the floor covering the Yugoslav",
          "Amazing & Moving. Outstanding collection of Emotive photos detailing the Struggle for independance. Well worth a visit",
          "We chanced upon this exhibition whilst recently in Dubrovnik. It was very moving and showed the effects of war on regions and people.",
          "A collection of photos with descriptions. Photos of suffering and hope. The venue is conveniently located in the heart of old town.",
          "The exhibit is well laid out, spacious and extremely tidy. The images, and the stories behind them, really take you on an emotional rollercoaster. Highly recommended.",
          "As a keen amateur photographer I had a visit to this attraction penciled in on my visit to Dubrovnik. The gallery is situated down a small side street in the old town. The photos are over two floors. The first floor was showing photos of the Iran-Iraq war taken by Alfred",
          "A heartfelt reminder of how Dubrovnik survived the civil war. Both the suffering, lives lost & the fortitude of normal people to rebuild lives & communities.",
          "This is a thought provoking and well laid out exhibition. The venue has good air conditioning so it\u2019s also perfect to take some time, cool down and think for a while. The photographs are fantastic and also quite harrowing in parts so trigger warnings for scenes of war and war",
          "A very poignant series of photographs - I cried twice on the way round. They give you each a guide book with information about each of the pictures, which was great to not have to cluster around signs. I went in not knowing anything about the conflict and learnt a great deal",
          "A very well presented and detailed collection of photographs from various bloody conflicts; but with particular focus on the Iran-Iraq war and the break-up of Yugoslavia. Having spent a few days in Dubrovnik, relaxing and enjoying the sights, it was that much more powerful to be",
          "The excellent collection of pictures of people affected by war is powerful. It includes military and civilians.",
          "This gallery of war photographs contains a large number of excellent photographs of people engaged in and caught up in conflict. Well worth a visit.",
          "A beautifully presented and diverse range of images from several modern day conflicts. Many of the images are disturbing but they are important documentation of significant events in human history. Like words, these images have the power to form a narrative of past atrocities",
          "Visited here a few days ago. Very moving experience. Lots of photos capturing the Iran Iraq war and also the war in former Yugoslavia. Photos of Dubrovnik shown during the war. Really humbling in my opinion. Cost 50 Kuna to go in, well worth the money. Lady at desk very",
          "Excellent exhibition with powerful photographs that tell the stories of different wars. A must see when visiting Dubrovnik.",
          "Entrance fee is 50 Kuna (not part of Dubrovnik Card Scheme), but worth every penny! I spent well over an hour here and had to look at every photograph. Very useful English guide book which is free to borrow. I also bought two of the amazing books. The exhibitions change.",
          "This is a great way to learn the history of the Balkans in the 1990s. The photography is amazing and really impactful. They have annotated guides you can carry around that give context both overall and to individual photos, which I thought was a novel way to caption the photos",
          "A very well laid out depiction of the wars from the area. Guide books in various languages are provided to explain each photograph. An excellent collection of pictures.",
          "This is a poignant narrative on the impact of war on the lives of ordinary people and on the soldiers too. Unmissable.",
          "As a group of 5 we all wanted to learn more about the wars that had impacted on the region. This exhibition was very well curated, and the photographs well displayed. The guide book gave a background to each piece and together it lead to a very moving experience. Well worth a",
          "We went as 4 adults and a small baby. We decided to go on a whim bc of the rain. I was interested in learning more about the Croatian war history. This place gave a great over view of various wars in the area. I really enjoyed the fact that the purpose of the museum was to",
          "Emotional and educative visit. Amazing pictures of recent wars very moving and touching for those of a sensitive nature. This is a clear sample of how an image can tell more than a hundred words. If you are interested in history or photography, this is a must.",
          "Collection of shocking photographs that really left an incredible impression. Through the photos you see a part of the country that is easily forgotten but so important not to forget. The photos are stunning: the emotion in them is tangible and I left emotional, sad but also",
          "This is a small but effective gallery of photos. Perhaps half is given over to a temporary exhibition, which was on the Iran-Iraq war. The other half was on the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s. The Yugoslavian section provides some very jarring photos of recognisable tourist hubs",
          "There is a premanent exhibition entitled \"the Death of Yugoslavia\", which portrays the different conflicts in ex-Yugoslavia. It is very salutory to look at events from only about 20 years back in places you have just visited. There was a good effort to be even-handed, although",
          "definitely a must see to learn about the challenges the area has faced and come back from. Definitely worth the price tag, well curated and felt it could easily be in London or New York in terms of display and exhibition space.",
          "a great exhibit and story about conflict displayed though the lens. a rotating one and a permanent. it is a great way to not forget.",
          "We wanted to get a better understanding of the war, and the photos told the stories, with accompanying texts to inform.",
          "This is a fascinating photo gallery that depicts several conflicts and wars that have occurred throughout Croatia (and a small selection of photos depicting events occurring outside of Croatia). It was an odd sensation to realize just how recently the city of Dubrovnik had seen",
          "As it was raining we spent time inside being reminded of the grim realities of war. The photos are incredible but hard hitting. They provided a window on the former Yugoslavia",
          "Highly moving exhibition covering a range of conflicts in the region, with work by different photographers. Well worth the very small entry fee (only 50 kn).",
          "A very interesting exhibition of a number of different wars from many different war photographers. The museum is reached up a flight of stairs but the inside is very nice and modern. There is no audio guide, instead you are given a book with all of the photographic information",
          "Incredible exhibition of photos showing conflicts and the effects of conflicts across the globe. It is moving and thought provoking in equal measure. I won't forget some of the images and the faces for a long time.",
          "It may be a bit hard to find (there's a new sign coming next week) but this is an exceptional and thought-provoking gallery - without being morbid or partisan. The quality of the photographs and their presentation is magnificent and very few people would fail to be absorbed by",
          "absolutely great place.. helps to try to understand the war.very insightful.. very unique museum.. unforgettable photos",
          "A very moving exhibition with a great variety of approached to the horrors of war. The photos were very well presented.",
          "My family and i visited here on holiday. Very interesting and some fantastic photo's. we just stumbled upon this please down a small side street, a very good find.",
          "Stop by this hugely interesting venue to learn more about the recent wars. The photography is outstanding and we learned a lot. Well worth visiting. We were quite affected by some of the images we saw and the suffering of the people. Some of those images will stay with me",
          "This gallery is nestled in a small side street off the main street in Dubrovnik's Old Town, and contains many photos documenting -- for the most part -- the wars in this part of the world that took place following the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. They are superb examples",
          "Well worth a visit if you want to see some of the amazing photo documentation of the Yugoslav wars . The photos and the stories are harrowing but the people behind them deserve remembrance and we should be thankful that many journalists and photographers were prepared to put",
          "An informative way to spend an hour or two. Photos are superb and in detail. Visitors given a guidebook to be returned on exit which gives narrative and context to each picture. Not all are easy to look at but no hiding the horrors of the wars in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia.",
          "This was a very moving and informative exhibit. The information was provided behind the moving display of photojournalism in many languages for your convenience. It is a good way to experience a peice of very real and relevant Croatian history.",
          "This photo exhibition offers some deep insights into the wars in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. There are basically three sub-exhibitions: Kosovo, Croatia, and Bosnia. Then, there are a number of pictures of other wars and conflicts in a separate room which are for sale. Some",
          "With a young child we hadn\u2019t done much in the way of museums and galleries this holiday but were keen to know more about the war so made time for this and really glad we did. The photos are amazing and each one told a story. It was very moving and we learnt a lot. Thank you.",
          "The photos remind us that we are all so close to such horrors. Especially poignant one of a very small child carrying water cans through ruined streets.",
          "Some stunning photos that captured the suffering and emotions of the war. It perhaps lacked a bit of context for those less familiar with the history of the war, but well worth seeking out nonetheless.",
          "Situated up a side street off the main pedestrian road in the old town, this collection of photographs will move your soul. It shows groups of soldiers, malitia and civilians caught up in the conflict. Photos are for sale at a price, but put on the headphones and listen to the",
          "For me, this was a bit of choker! I was a child/teenager and remember the news/photos of this conflict. To see it in sequence and explained was tough, but I like to know the history of the place I visit. What is amazing about this is to see the pictures on Dubrovnik now",
          "I enjoyed the gallery , it gives a good account of the war and makes you think about where you are. It helps to remember these things were not that long ago , and should not be forgotten",
          "At very moving experience... take the time to get away from the busy streets and see how the locals managed during the recent conflict",
          "If you want to learn about Croatia's fight for independence, this is the place for you. Stunning pictures with clear explanations. Glad we visited.",
          "This exhibition provides detailed and graphic images of the wars spanning the various regions and former countries of Yugoslavia. The photography is exceptional and captures the brutality and horrors of war. The details of the wars and of each photograph are very thorough and",
          "Each photo tells a story of the various conflicts. Hard to get your mind around how recently these atrocities occurred. The guide book tells the story of each photo, placing them in context and expanding on the story they already tell.",
          "great photojournalism, a good exhibition and setting. Felt I got a bit of an education...and that it was only right to have seen these photos to witness what had occured in such recent times in this part of europe, and in other wars. Dubrovnik as a city is quite awe inspiring;",
          "Like any War dedicated museum it is a sobering moment to see what the impact on people war has delivered. Worth going to for sure.",
          "I'm so glad I spent an hour in this museum. I learned more about the history of the Yugoslav war. The photos are arranged so that you enter in and start on the left with a guide book with a few sentences about the photograph. Next room about Kosovo war, and then other",
          "To be in Croatia and not visit this museum is a crime in itself. Set in the middle of the old town the only complaint I would have is that you can hear the busy allies outside while looking at the harsh realities of war through a lens",
          "This collection of photos is housed over 2 floors in a building just off the Stradun. Entry is 50 kuna and you are given a book which describes each photo. The photos detail the impact of the recent conflicts in the area, I found it very informative and really moving. I don't",
          "The exhibition immediately lets you reflect the current situation:could it happen again? A must when visiting Dubrovnik and having seen all the beautifully restored roofs and historic buildings in the Old City.",
          "Moving and thought provoking pictorial journey through the Balkan wars. Incredible photographs, but such a waste of life",
          "Showing the misery of war of the former Yuoslavia, but further into the miseries of the world beyond. Expensive for the time we were there & left me feeling confused and low, not for holiday makers. Visit the war exhibition on the mountain: more informative & thought-provoking.",
          "It's an odd thing to do on a holiday, to visit a place that tells a story of sadness and waste of beautiful human lives -- but I guess I had to do it because it is part of Dubrovnik's story.",
          "We visited here having ben in Dubrovnik before the war . Very moving to see the faces on the photo's staring out from nearly thirty years ago .",
          "This museum is a reminder that not too long ago the region you're sightseeing in was torn by war. The inhumanity captured is startling. Dubrovnik burning feels like one of the milder scenes. The museum is well done, and well worth an hour of your time, to learn more about the",
          "A well laid out few rooms of exceptional photos from the time of the 1990s war. Sobering to consider, extremely well presented. Nobody should miss this.",
          "Very powerful exhibits which portrays the impact of warfare on civilians and soldiers without taking sides in history.",
          "This is a brilliant photographic exhibition of the wars fought in recent times by frontline press photographers, one of whom is the New Zealand owner. Some of the photos are very sad and distressing of a very cruel and evil war. Please visit to be able to put Dubrovnik in",
          "Well worth a visit to understand the very recent conflict. Some of the photos are difficult to see but that is the point. This makes for an interesting change of mood from other activities in Dubrovnik.",
          "The photos are amazing. Sadly I didn\u2019t leave with a firm gasp on what happened, there seem to have been so many countries factions and groups involved that if you don\u2019t enter with a sound understanding on the story and politics you may not leave any the wiser - that said, the",
          "This is a gallery devoted to showing images of conflict, and its effects on human societies and groups. It\u2019s possible always to call it pornographic, because this kind of material is not easily lightly viewed or glossed over. This exhibition is tough to take in, and I needed an",
          "You need time and patient to read photos descriptions. Then you will get a doze of emotions... One more time you will think about world's (people's) craziness. Moving!",
          "I cannot express how amazing this place is - well worth a visit. So totally moving. There are no signs asking people to be quiet, but the photos ans stories beside them are so moving nobody talks. I had tears in my eyes. This is an amazing place, cannot recommend highly enough -",
          "this is very moving. The photos are unreal. This is a must visit for everyone to learn the history of these wars.",
          "If you are in Dubrovnik take a couple of hours out of your day to visit War Photo Limited. Obviously the subject matter here is a very difficult one for a lot of people but we mustn't forget the recent history of this wonderful country and this exhibition gives an excellent",
          "Such a great job has been done of restoring Dubrovnik that it\u2019s hard to believe the devastation that was brought about such a relatively short time ago. This exhibition brought home the destruction and the human cost of the conflict in the region. Was upsetting bur well worth",
          "We had been here over a week and only just read about this amazing collection of sad but professional photographs from N Z Wade Goddard. He recorded right through all the countries after the break up of the former Yugoslavia. Just an incredible exhibition of war and conflict and",
          "An absolute must. I learnt so much. I felt guilty appreciating the stunning photography as an art form, when the history behind them was so so sad...& recent. I had never truly grasped the complex history of the wars in this are in the 1990s until visiting this museum. A true",
          "Interesting and very moving. I recommend this for all older teenagers and adults. The information booklets were especially useful to provide the \u2018story\u2019 of each photograph.",

          "Unfortunately, there are always wars some place on the globe :-( this exhibition is of course focused on the Balkan wars but there is also an \u201cinternational\u201c section. A place to visit and reflect and hopefully helps to avoid future conflicts !",
          "We took an hour or so away from the city to take in this museum. It provides a sombre and poignant reminder of the tragic recent history of this city and the area. A worthwhile experience.",
          "Amazing photographic exhibition of war. Incredible to see how stupid men can be; how brave photographers can be and how we struggle to learn and come up with non conflict solutions.",
          "A combination of loving photography and knowing little about this war attracted me to this exhibition. Struggled a bit with taking my 13 and 16 yr old to such a sober musem on their summer holiday but so glad we did. We all found it tough but the exhibition is fantastic and",
          "Visited at lunchtime on a Wednesday and not very busy. The photos, whilst not gruesome, are really thought provoking. The focus is upon Kosovo and Croatian conflicts which occurred in the 1990's and so only twenty or so years ago. Whilst some photos are of the military, the",
          "It\u2019s hard to believe that Dubrovnik was in the conflict only two decades ago as it is so peaceful today. It\u2019s a great exhibition to recall what had happened in the region. I\u2019m very glad I visited there so that now I can see the city from a different point of view.",
          "This was a disturbing and enlightening experience not judging but providing photographic journalistic insight into the conflict across the former Yugoslavia. It brought close to home the myth that these types of conflicts can no longer happen in Europe.",
          "Since you have to pay for every single thing in Dubrovnik, my girlfriend and I decided to go to a couple of museums and exhibitions in the city, since it\u2019s almost imposible to cover everything. I think the War Photo Limited exhibition was the best choice. The museum covers the",

          "The War Photo museum is about war in general, not just about the Balkan Wars of the 1990s (although that is part of it). It's not \"fun,\" but for anyone who takes the state of the world seriously, it's a sobering experience.",
          "A view on war, both the recent conflict in Croatia, but also war around the world. There are no political or moral judgements, just snapshots of moments in time capturing the people involved in conflict throughout the world.",

          "I chose to come here as I found Dubrovniks touristy city centre very annoying. I wanted to learn more about the Balkan people so decided to go this exhibition in the evening....I stayed there for a good 2 hours, looking at the wonderful and emotive inducing photos....tears in my",

          "This museum is a hidden gem and well worth a stop to get away from the busy main street. There were 3 exhibitions that showcased stories from Afghanistan and the recent conflicts in the area. A really powerful and thought provoking museum. A must see for any visitor to the area.",
          "I\u2019m glad we took the time to walk through War Photo Limited. It took about 45min to walk through and read all of the captions. They give you and English Guide that you can read from. English captions are also beside the prints. You really feel the emotion of the time through",

          "Bit of a break from the shops and beaches. Interesting place. Worth visiting and good to so something a bit different",
          "This exhibition was a real eye opener, it will expand your mind and open up other possibilities... ok so maybe not, but it will enrich your life with stories of a struggle and real people in real times. A very serious and exceptional photographic experience. Highly recommended.",

          "Interesting, beautiful, and, at times, upsetting, this is well worth a visit. The permanent exhibit on the breakup of Yugoslavia is fascinating.",
          "The War Photo Limited is definitely a place to visit while in Dubrovnik. It is beautifully done, with the free guidebook giving fantastic detail to each photograph. It shows a different side to Dubrovnik and the region as a whole that is very thought provoking.",
          "We visited this museum as we wanted to see the human impact of the recent Yugoslav conflict. This museum provided that in all too vivid and sad a focus. The museum is just of Stradun and very easy to access. Cost was 50 Kuna. The museum is a collection of war photos from the",
          "Never an easy topic to discuss or illustrate, this exhibition was respectful and informative. A definite place to go and learn",
          "This exhibition is in a side street in Dubrovnik and easily missed. This would be a pity because it is worth an hour or two to visit it. Quite horrific at times but what else is war but horrific ?",
          "After walking completely around the ramparts (a must) we stopped in this small museum for a quick peak but ended up staying for over an hour. First, it is dark and air-conditioned, which was a welcome break from the heat of the day up on the ramparts. Most importantly though",
          "This was one of the places where it feels almost wrong to say that I enjoyed it due to the material, however it was very moving to see each image and read about the wider context behind the photo. The museum is also well organised and designed and you move round to the left on",
          "A stunning array of photos and history of the conflict. Allow at least 2 hours. Once viewed the exhibition walk up the wooden stairs to the roof where you can see a great view of the port and islands below.",
          "I paid and entered thinking this exhibition was about the Homeland War, but actually the scope is much broader - it covered conflicts across the world, in Yemen, Afghanistan and others. I was with my kids which was, yes, a little uncomfortable but they really found the photos",
          "Have just left this museum and finding it hard to write how it had made me feel. I'm shaken and upset. But that is what makes this place so important. Knowing the impact of war is something we should all understand - we need empathy to stop these terrible things happening again.",
          "The photography in this exhibition of war photography is excellent, some beautiful pictures of terrible sad situations. A lot about the war in the 1990s, pictures of Dubrovnik, Mostar and Sarajevo under siege. Pictures of refugees and militias. Also recent photos from Yemen,",
          "An exhibition of war photography probably isn't high on the agenda for most visitors to Dubrovnik, but I'd urge anyone visiting to pop in and check out this stunning array of photographs. Covering several different conflicts of modern times, it's a jaw-dropping selection spread",

          "There is no better example of the phrase \"a picture tells a thousand words\". I learnt more here about both the middle eastern refugee crisis and the Yugoslavian war than I ever would have from reading a history book! Thoroughly recommended, very important for all to see.",

          "A nice small museum with a good exposition of pictures about a current issue & about the end of Yugoslavia (Croatian, Bosnian & Kosovo independence war), which only tells a story from a strongly one-sided view. The Serbian army is pictured as a bunch of blood-thirsty idiots,",

          "This is such an important place to visit. It deepened and broadened my mind and it has had an impact on my appreciation of the Balkan people, Yemen and other places affected by war. As tourists deciding what to do with our time and money we can forget what is happening in our",
          "This exhibition is well presented and well worth a visit. My husband and I spent longer there than we had anticipated and whilst not a cheery thing to do on our holiday, we felt it was well worth the time. When you arrive, you are given a guide book (that has to be returned)",

          "Excellent gallery with some truly wonderful photos around the genre of conflict. Certainly many are quite graphic but they serve a point. Excellent presentation, well lit and easy to move around. Some truly great and harrowing photos on display here. If you love photography",
          "An unexpected gem in Dubrovnik - showing photos of a range of recent conflicts, thoughtfully presented to make the viewer think. Neither simplifies nor glorifies war, but shows its human impact. Very much worth a visit.",
          "If you like history this is a right place to visit. Rich with historical and homeland war photos. In moments is very sad, but mostly showing proud moments of hard time for Dubrovnik and it's citizens. Been a bit shaken with all of that, but helped me to understand some key",
          "As a lover of photography I was blown away by the photographs in the two exhibitions at War Photo Limited. However, you do not have to be a fan of the art to appreciate it. There are two exhibitions: one temporary and one permanent. The temporary exhibit by Maria Turchenkova on",
          "Gallery is really well done. Images illustrate Balkan and other recent conflicts that have happened in our lifetime. Really interesting and gives you a good perspective. Teenagers found it fascinating",
          "I was impressed that the exhibition allowed me the time and space to think about the photos and those who took them. For me there was the right mix of human tragedy and hope for the future. I would have seen more from the Dubrovnik siege however this is a minor issue.",
          "We stopped in during a 2 day trip, left feeling like we had a much better understanding of the recent history that shapes the people of this region. The photos were so much more tangible than reading a history of the war. Highly recommend.",
          "Beautiful images of wars in several continents in recent decades - very educational but haunting . Highly recommended",
          "This museum was one of my Top 3 must-dos for my long weekend in Dubrovnik. Human conflicts and war reporting has always intrigued me, and this museum has put together a really thought provoking, but also well-thought out presentation of the stories behind the images displayed.",
          "Some amazing photos on display that really make you think about the recent history of the area. very good value too.",
          "We were not sure what to expect but are so pleased we went in. The photography is extremely thought provoking and is of the highest quality (some prints can be bought). It is easy to forget this actually happened, and it's a stark reminder of the impact of war. There are two",
          "This is a must see - very confronting, but thought provoking about what has and is happening In the war torn countries. Amazing photos.",
          "You should definitely see this gallery in Dubrovnik! Especially the exhibition of the war in Yugoslavia is a good presentation of the horror they went through in Dubrovnik and many other cities and villages in the Balkan area just about 20 years ago.",
          "Definitely check out if you have time in Dubrovnik. Just off the top end of the central street in the old town. 50kn entrance with discount for students. Amazing photos and informative and eye opening to the atrocities of the Croatian fight for independence.",
          "I came to War Photo Limited on a Sunday afternoon and overall the photos are interesting and of a good quality, but only the temporary exhibition was really moving for me personally. Not a terrible attraction but any means but it certainly isn't life changing.",
          "We came here a while back when there was also an exhibition on immigration from war-torn countries. I found both the exhibition on Croatian independence and the exhibition in immigration very moving and informative, explaining things in an objective manner. I would highly",
          "Great photo exhibition in the middle of Old town Dubrovnik. During the warm time of the day this is the perfect museum visit when you are in Dubrovnik. Highly recommend.",
          "E cellanti if not painful exhibition of war photos. Provides very good history of local conflicts. Good curation. Well worth an hour or two of your time.",
          "When you visit a city heaving with tourists and stunning to visit it is sometimes easy to forget it's recent history. This photo exhibition is a must for all generations. It looks at all the conflict of the 90s in former Yugoslavia through a series of photos accompanied by a",
          "Visited with my 14 year old daughter as I wanted her to understand a little of the terrible events in the early 90s. Although the exhibition covers other wars and conflicts it was the photos of the Balkans war that interested us. Important that any visitor to the area",
          "I aspire to be a photographer but after visiting this exhibition my pictures are meaningless. There are three main sections; the first is about the Gazza Strip, the second the Croatia/Serbia war and the third a number of conflicts around the world. This is not about the",
          "The photos are jarring and upsetting. It is a good reminder of what the country has been through. It prevented me from taking advantage of the beauty/history of Old Town. Some reviews mentioned how one sided the photos are from the recent conflict in Gaza. It was an exhibit of",
          "Not a light hearted tourist attraction, but incredibly powerful testament of how humans can be incredibly destructive and also how kind we can be in desperate times. The photography is world class and tells the story of Croatia and other recent conflicts in a compelling and",
          "Located just off Stradun in old city. Exposes the human cost of war brilliantly through large photo prints. Well worth a visit.",
          "This pictures exhibition about war was worth seeing as it depicts the effects of conflicts on the civilians in a country which underwent this tragedy just a few years ago.",
          "Some great photo's here, bringing to life the history and horrors of war. Which just goes to show a picture can paint a thousand words, and when we have so many why do we see so much conflict and fighting going on in our world today. All in all this was a well planned put",
          "Just writing this review makes me sad. It was an experience that I feel is necessary when making the trip to Dubrovnik. To respect the strength and resilience of anyone that had to endure war and the aftermath.",
          "We wanted to know more about the wars associated with the former Yugoslavia. The first floor was dedicated to the Israeli / Gaza conflict. As per another post, it's one sided as all about the suffering of the Palestinians, but that's the exhibition. We all know there are two",
          "A photo exhibition about war may not be on everyone's list of things to do on holiday but we had a few spare hours in Dubrovnik and decided to go in. I'm glad we did because it was fascinating. The exhibition has interesting and moving photos from all different wars but the most",
          "A museum of photography, a museum where most photographs are about recent war in Yugoslavia. There are temporary exhibitions, all about war in other parts of the world. The museum does not have the toilet.",
          "Dubrovnik, today, is wonderfully beautiful but, not so long ago, it was, of course, battling. That war, and the broader war in what was formerly Yugoslavia, brought a horrendous cost for many. The closing period of Yugoslavia is depicted movingly in the permanent exhibition",
          "A visit to this museum certainly puts things into perspective. While many of us visiting see Croatia and Dubrovnik as they exist today, it's very hard to believe (despite living during the times) that a war took place on the very streets you are walking on in Dubrovnik less than",
          "This is an excellent exhibition which highlights the human side of war. There are many photographs and each and every one of them is moving in its own way. This will probably leave you feeling a bit sombre and reflective especially when you see Dubrovnik only 25 years ago and",
          "During our visit to Dubrovnik we visited this war photo exhibition. The main section is about the war in former Yugoslavia but currently there is also a section about the war in Gaza. All very impressive pictures! Well worth a visit!",
          "Tucked away in a side street, this small museum was a reminder of what you don't necessarily see from war/conflict. As of June, there were two series: about the Palestinians and the three sides in the Bosnian War. The tragic beauty of both of them was that they didn't sugercoat",
          "I heard about this on the flight to Croatia from a fellow traveller . When I found it I wasn't dissapointed, A really well laid out exhibition",
          "This exhibition includes stunning photographs in every sense of the word. Photographs and accompanying documentary in the catalogue tell the stories of conflicts and their impact from around the world. The 1st floor exhibition when we visited focused on Palestine / Israel. The",
          "This museum of just photos is definately worth the visit. It is a very moving experience, you are also given a guidebook that gives a short context of each photo.",
          "An absorbing and powerful experience visiting here, located on one of the narrow alleys It consists of hundreds of outstanding photos from war correspondents around the word, but mainly concentrating on the Yugoslavia wars, and the wars in Gaza.. When you go in you will be",
          "This is an exhibition of photographs take during several wars. The photographer tells the story of these wars through his photos. Written information is provided as well to help explain the very complicated sequence of events that led to war. Powerful and moving experience.",
          "It is \"just\" a museum of photographs but it the message in pictures of war struck Croatia and Bosnia is very powerful.",
          "The exhibition was brilliant. I loved it. The idea is to really open people's eyes up to the atrocities and sadness of war, so be prepared to have your heartstrings pulled. If your into photography at all you will absolutely appreciate the skill and beauty in the photographs -",
          "Sobering photos and very powerful. A must see. Thought provoking. We Would recommend this exhibition",
          "A fantastic little gallery, the pictures are spectacular and quite often upsetting to look at, t will leave a lasting impression. Really worth visiting. Only takes about 40mins - 1 hour to go around the exhibitions, take your time to read through the guide book thats gives a",
          "Very interesting and well displayed exhibition. They give you a guide book so you can take time to read all the descriptions at your own pace. Some tough pictures and stories but important to see I think.",
          "I visited this exhibition following a recommendation from another solo traveller and wouldn't hesitate in recommending it now myself . Very reasonable entry of 50 kuna especially in comparison with other attractions and I spent about 2.5 hours there. Well presented and a",
          "The quality of photographs in this museum is tremendous. We were pleasantly surprised that there were exhibitions on the Palestinian conflict as well as the Bosnia and Kosovo wars. It could be said that there is a high degree of impartiality with the focus very much",
          "War Photo Limited is a photogallery showing evidence of the cruelties and injustices on innocents and combatants during the wars in Yugoslavia. A shocking experience!",
          "This was recommended to us by fellow travel friends and had they not have told us, we never would have known about it. This is a museum that showcases international and civil wars in photography and it is just incredible. Spinetingling, confronting and just moving. Not for kids",
          "This is worth a look as it's more than the Croatian conflict. The recent photo of refugees is a stark reminder that this is not history, it's current",
          "I think the price is a little high for the amount of time you can spend looking at the pictures. Clearly they are professional quality and uncensored showing scenes of death or near to death. I like that it covered more than the National war or even outside of the continent.",
          "Not what we were expecting, but still very interesting. The photos cover more than just the recent Croatian war, including a number of other wars and war areas.",
          "Very close to main street but not many people there. Found photos from Gaza, particularly the ones of dead children, very moving. Brings home that it is the innocent who suffer the most in war. Very sad photos but worth a visit.",
          "I would highly recommend coming to the War Photo Limited Museum - it is very well put together as you get a booklet at the start which gives you a short commentary for each of the photos you are viewing, giving you some context. The photos are very thought provoking and emotive",
          "Amazing photography telling harrowing recent war events. Deeply moving. Good exhibition and useful guide.",
          "An fascinating collection of photographs collecting during wartime. Visitors are handed guide books on entry to explain a little about each picture. Part of the current display is devoted to the impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Gaza Strip residents in 2014 with",
          "One floor was dedicated to the Gaza conflict and the other to the Yugoslavian homeland war. Don't go to be entertained but to get a better insight into what war really means through some exceptional photos.",
          "If you have ever wondered why most of us military veterans do not readily counsel war, this should answer your question. This is a real-life look at the slaughter and horror that is war. The photography is haunting and disturbing -- photo-journalism at its best. It may very well",
          "These pictures made me think how well things are in scandinavia. Booklet was provided when you bought the tickets and it was really informative and gave me backround for each picture. Perhaps pics are not suitable for yougnsters but adult visitors of Dubrovnik should absolutely",
          "The photos, taken in different war zones and specifically the Balkan Wars, were heart wrenching and almost too sad to look at, but we need to know how war affects the innocent. The fact that it is inside the city walls which has also seen such mindless destruction makes the",
          "A must see, watch the movie and see the poor victims of a sensless war. Hard to believe in our modern day such incidents in such a friendly and peaceful place took place. A must see and respect.",
          "The images are powerful and compelling but the data accompanying them and the focus we found too limited and narrow",
          "It helps understand the war of the Balkans in the 90-s. Sequels can still be seen widely today; although Croatia has recovered almost fully (apparently is the only one)",
          "Visited War Photo Limited in early May when on a day trip to Dubrovnik. This experience is deeply moving, whilst the exhibition is sensitive to the individual. An incredible collection of witness statements through photography to the horrors of conflict and its impact. Highly",
          "This collection of photos covers Croatia's part in the war and other conflicts around the world. Some of the photos are hard to look at but it certainly helps to give you an understanding of what it must be like to live in a war torn city. As a mother and Grandmother the photos",
          "This a beautifully painful museum where the atrocities of several wars are expressed deeply. A must-see on this time and age.",
          "Quite a sobering experience that makes you wonder what human beings are really all about when you see what they do to one another? Worthwhile searching it out though and very relevant given the history of Dubrovnik - especially in recent years. Well presented and not expensive",
          "This is a must do if for no other reason than to understand what happened in the very city you are in. Many of the images will remind you of the news reels at the time, but it is important that we do not forget the suffering that led to the peace of today.",
          "We arrived in Dubrovnik during a day of heavy rain so visited the War Photo exhibition to dry out! The exhibition is broken down into multiple areas with temporary photos on display from recent conflicts, however the main focus and also the permanent exhibition centres in the",
          "This is a nicely laid out exhibition of war photos , the majority of them have or similar have been shown on news programmes in the past , the tv video in the middle of the upstairs exhibition is quite short and doesn't tell you a great deal about the end of Yugoslavia , they",
          "Interesting experience. Knowledge building & presented in a modern, informative way through the use of a guidebook. Be prepared to be very humbled & sad too. Well worth the 50Kn.",
          "Raw pictures gave us an inside look of several wars. It gave us insight to how war effects civilian and soldiers.",
          "Everybody must visit this exhibition it gives you a true understanding of the effects of war. It is too easy to watch the news and not think about the innocent people that is effected by war. For me the Gaza photos were the most moving. It left the two women in my group",
          "This is a good photographic museum of war. The photos depict real scenes and are graphic but one should not forget what happened here. The guide book is excellent and explains the photographs. Well worth an hour of anyone's time.",
          "Really interesting museum, well worth a visit. Knowing very little about the conflict that destroyed so much of Dubrovnik, it was really good to understand a bit more. Whilst it is hard viewing some photos, it is an important museum to visit during your time here. I would highly",
          "This is a display of war photos. Some are disturbing but thought provoking. It covered several wars including the Balkan conflict. It would not be something I would have chosen to visit, but I am glad I did.",
          "While it may be a kill joy to visit a museum with theme of war on a holiday to Dubrovnik; this little museum packs a powerful punch of reminding you the ground you are standing on was a war zone barely 2 decades ago. I wish I had taken my children to see the photo journal of",
          "It's a good report of the balcan's war. An awake for something that happen a few years ago in Europe. It has others photos from others recent conflicts too.",
          "A humbling experience of great war photography . If ever the futility of war was so powerfully shown this was it. Beautifully presented, excellent accompanying guide book and without question the best \u00a35 I have spent in a long time.",
          "Best place to get a handle on the wars in the region. Very powerful. Also has other conflicts as well. Some very graphic images.",
          "This museum had three exhibitions ongoing at the time, Gaza, former Yugoslavian wars, and a general one. It was quite good. I had forgotten some of the iconic Yugoslav ones. 45 minutes should do it. 50HRK too. So good value.",
          "This museum provides a powerful statement, through photographs, of the cost of war. It has a permanent exhibit on the second floor from the 1991-95 war in the region, and two rotating exhibits. When I was there, one was on the Palestinian territories and the 2013 conflict in",
          "Such raw emotion in these very unsettling images of war torn populations. Exhibition itself well worthwhile - the curator needs to be a little friendlier perhaps? We only visited as we had heard about him along the kiwi grapevine, but when we mentioned this, he was not keen to",
          "Excellent pictures and words take you group several conflicts. Shows the cost to hunamnity and the economy. Well worth. A visit.",
          "The photos in this exhibit are truly horrific at times. They evoked emotions that I didn't even know I could experience. But, I think that is the point. This museum/exhibit did a wonderful job of educating me on the horrors of war throughout the world, the history of wars in",
          "The images in here will shock - but what surrounds them is an enlightening and sensitively curated museum that provides just enough historical context to let the pictures tell the story. When we visited (April 2017), two exhibitions were on - one depicting life (and death) in",
          "This museum is one that you may want to miss, but you mustn't. The story of the war is well told and is one that is within our lifetimes, causing shock when you think about what happened to the city and how their neighbours were shelling the town and killing lots of people and",
          "I spent the afternoon here with my 23 yr old daughter and got to see this exhibit not only for myself but through her eyes also. The stories and the captured moments of human endurance, frailties and the brutal realities of war have been displayed with humanity and truth. We",
          "A great exhibition of the difficulties suffered by the people of the region during wartime. The area covering Dubrovnik while it was under siege was particularly interesting, but the whole museum is amazing! Not to be missed.",
          "If you want to see a different perspective to that of the mass media then pay the exhibition a visit. Harrowing and thought provoking photography",
          "Entry to the exhibition is not included with the Dubrovnik Card but it's worth the trip anyway. The photography here is really stunning and they do an great job of explaining the context of what is happening in the photos. We visited when there was an exhibition on the recent",
          "We had seen posters about this exhibition and decided to pay a visit, I had no idea the horrors these people suffered and the utter destruction caused by this war to the city of Dubrovnik . The photographs and short films show the horrors of a modern war a exhibition well worth",
          "A lovely gallery with some really moving exhibits. We visited in the summer where we saw the \"Balkan route\", which was an incredible and touching exhibit. It's decent value and I would really recommend visiting it.",
          "Tried to visit today in December but it is closed all winter. Shame as we wanted to learn about the war. However we took a taxi to top of Mt Srd and visited the War museum there which was open and excellent.",
          "seeing the old town of Dubrovnik is being put into perspective by seeing how much destruction the greed and stupidity of barbaric modern humanity causes by waging war in the 1990s on this special, medieval town. Honor the fallen. May we learn from History.",
          "An impressive exhibition of photo's of the present war in Syria/Iraq and of the Balkan war in the 1990's. They also show short movies of that last war. It gives a good impression of what happenend and the pain of the people. You should visit it.",
          "My wife and I were blown away by how well put together this gallery is. Its a rare form of art to capture the story behind a war, and portray it in such a way that can draw one in and make them want to learn more.",
          "When we visited there was a series of photo's entitled road to the caliphate, looking at the conflict around Iraq and Syria back to the second gulf conflict. The photos were displayed and we were given an information book containing information on the pictures. These were very",
          "This museum showcases photos from the Siege of Dubrovnik, as well as wars in Bosnia and Iraq. Booklets are available in a few different languages, which give you a description of each of the photos. It was a moving exhibit and very sad to see the devastation resulting from so",
          "I still do not understand the ins and outs of the war and don't think I ever will but, this small museum helped a bit. The photography on show is very thought provoking, very clever photographers. Well worth a visit.",
          "Found this museum really interesting. They gave you a booklet with the story behind all the photo's some of which were quite graphic with ones depicting the war in Iraq. They also had a section of the Croatian war in the early 1990's, which shows what life was like for the",
          "The great reviews here, and everything else I'd read about this gallery gave me high hopes for a wonderful and moving experience. Alas, I have to say that I was disappointed. The bulk of the museum is taken up by the temporary exhibition which, right now, is a large group of",
          "This exhibit is really moving -so powerful but also heartbreaking. It makes you think. The photographs are sunning and there are also excellent notes with the explanations in several languages. Great part of the museum covers is about war in Iraq and Syria. The exhibit on the",
          "Beautiful museum. Best in Dubrovnik by far. The photos were incredible. The photojournalist in me was very impressed.",
          "This was a favorite museum in Dubrovnik. Lots of photos of Iraq and a very moving room of photos of the war in Croatia in the 90's They close at 4, so get there earlier.",
          "This is a worthwhile attraction, but we were expecting to see more photography relating to the Yugoslav conflict. The Iraq exhibit was well done, but overall we were disappointed.",
          "We learned so much from this exhibition, sad that it happened so recently and yet we were so ignorant of the detail. Very moving and thought provoking.",
          "This is a photographic account of war, very well laid out and some provocative and quality photography. I was expecting it to be about the war between the various countries involved in the war in former Yugoslavia. There were some photographs from that conflict but most were",
          "Of course I was aware of what happened during the war but to see and hear all the interesting facts was both sad and facinating",
          "It's a well put together display of photographs from a photographer's time in several conflict zones. I would have liked to see the emphasis flipped: strangely there is much more space dedicated to the Middle East disputes than the history of Yugoslavia / Croatia, which I'm",
          "This two-story gallery is located in an alley a few streets from the Pile Gate. I spent an hour perusing the well-curated exhibits and I am so glad I stumbled upon this wonderful gallery. The permanent exhibit upstairs is raw and powerful but gives good insights into the wars in",
          "War is never something you want to \"see,\" but the imagery displayed was good and the presentation excellent. A nice small museum to spend an hour+ in.",
          "War photographs including conflicts up to 2016 - very thought provoking - covers the recent conflict in Croatia - seeing pictures of the damage inflicted on Dubrovnik's old town really brought home the reality of this.",
          "I saw little in Dubrovnik to remind its many visitors of the recent war that Croatia and Serbia had become involved in. That's not really surprising as to most Dubrovnik is a tourist attraction. War Photo Limited is a small gallery along one of the side alleys and hardly",
          "Excellent photos but I am not sure the war in Croatia took second place to the conflicts in the middle east.Photos were so comprehensive that I decided not to duplicate this by going to the Museum of the war of independence.I should add that there is a narrative which explains",
          "Visited as read a recommendation to not miss. Glad we didnt as its a great exhibition of photos of war related atrocities up to modern day. Think the main interest was the higher floor of Yugoslavias turmoil of the early 90's.",
          "Just go there! Go there and learn the brutalities of the 20th century. A magnificent photo summary of IS, Al Qaida and the civil war in former Jugoslavia. The photos of Dubrovnik under siege and a rain of bombs are brutal and important to see. Just go there.",
          "I was looking forward to this exhibition to write some greater detail to the Bosnian conflict that that Dubrovnik was involved in. A large part of the exhibition that I saw focused on the Iraq and was interesting wasn't what I had come for. The second-floor did however focus",
          "A little, actually a lot depressing, but an important site to show how tribal thinking, prejudice, and religion combined with politics can bring out the worse in mankind. Really helps to understand Yugoslavias slide into chaos in 90's.",
          "We were glad, and sad, that we included this exhibition during our time in Dubrovnik. The gallery was well set out. However, the lighting was suitably dimmed for such tragic photos but it made the constant reading a strain. This exhibition is a 'must visit' as we must never",
          "We visited this exhibition on an afternoon when it was raining, well worth the small admission fee. There were photos for different conflicts around the world. We were most interested in the recent war that affect Croatia and wanted to understand the impacted on the local",
          "Very intresting display of photo's and a lot of information. Galary was not very big but well worth a visit. Just goes to show how far Croatia has come since the early 90's",
          "I was hoping for more on the local wars but mainly on the wars in the Middle East. It hasn't been over dramatised which is respectful. The information book was good and the introduction from the photographer interesting. The videos are informative.",
          "This exhibition is a sad insight into the impact of war around the world. It is well presented and has a mix of different conflicts. When you enter you are given a text book explaining each of the photos. The galaxy is well laid out and want too it's when we were there. It took",
          "Each photo has it's own story. Some are very graphic. For me, the overall picture or story line was missing.",
          "We nearly didn't bother to visit this exhibition, but are so glad we did.As well as seeing some very powerful images, it gave us a very different and valuable persepective on Dubrovnik. Great contrast to the tourist crowds.",
          "Very much for adults. This is not fun, it's moving and emotional. Although the photo's on display are mostly from the Iraq conflict, the top floor deals with the regional conflict of the early 1990's and ensures you don't leave with a smile on your face. Oddly, one of the",
          "You learn a lot about the Bosnia war from Croatia's perspective. they have photos, and documentaries which explains the whole event in detail.",
          "I did like the most of the photos of the resent history of Croatia. Those and the video was very touchfull,,,did not fancy so much the photos of Irak",
          "This was an unexpected and sobering visit following a ride on the Cable Car It is thought-provoking and yet rewarding in a strange way We were both moved by the way the exhibition is set out and the Black and White photography is stunning A must for anyone visiting Dubrovnik",
          "The photographs here really tell the story. Human tragedy, the sad price of war innocent civilians pay in any war. I understood the why's it happened. Some of the photos were in your face so to speak, but to get the message across, its the only way to do it. Great exhibition.",
          "We came here on a rainy afternoon for about an hour or so. I knew from other reviews that it started out with a history of current events/war and ended with the break of up Yugoslovia in the 90's. Each visitor was able to have a big booklet that showed each photo portrayed on",
          "Certainly worth a visit but be warned some of the pictures don't pull any punches. The section on the war in Croatia and Bosnia was very interesting.",
          "Just off the Stradun and worth a visit. Well organised, but didn't take too long to walk round. Many other things to see and do with this attraction probably being not in the top 5, but pop in if you have some spare time.",

          "I think I need a small room to crawl into and cry. War sucks. The pictures are an incredible up close and personal perspective of the carnage of war. The current exhibition of Iraq and Syria is so heart breaking. The permanent exhibition of the Yugoslavian conflict is a must to",

          "This gallery seems to hold various exhibitions at different times as well as a permanent display on the 1990's Balkan war. When we were there they were showing a collection on the Iraq war which was very hard hitting and not for the squeamish. The building itself is plain but",

          "The museum is well worth a visit, it is easily reached just off the main street running through the old town. You will spend an hour or more here and it gives a good feel for the 1991-95 period when war was raging in Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina. There was also the temporary",
          "Well organised and very interesting and fascinating insight into war. With each photo you are told of the whereabouts and the lives of the people behind the photo. Very moving. Well worth an hour of your trip.",
          "However, I was hoping for more information around the lead up to the bombardment and the terrible ordeal that the residents had to endure. I say this as it shouldn't be hidden away or forgotten. Please don't let this put you off a visit though as it is worth visiting.",
          "I am a lover of photography, having been an avid Life reader many years ago. I highly recommend this smallbut very powerful exhibition of war photography. Very easy to find, it's off the main Stradun close to a small supermarket, just a few steps up from the main drag. Air",

          "We visited this exhibit and were stunned to silence. The photos are moving and the exhibit includes a guide book that will tell you about each picture. It is real, nearly hard to take at times but important to see the real side of the war.",
          "I agree with other reviews very well set out and curated. Upon entry we were each given a book (written in English) which gave the background to each photograph . Especially thought provoking to go back onto the streets now filled with tourists but not long ago where the scenes",

          "I can only agree with what most people say about this exhibition. It really does hit home what human kind can do to one another. This is again a must see in Dubrovnik",
          "Well worth a visit - depicting recent conflicts through photographs is powerful in provoking emotion.",
          "Saw the Syria/Iraq exhibition along with the permanent Balkan one. Absolutely fascinating! Guide book explaining each photo was well worth reading. Shop is full of amazing photography books too.",
          "I had this exhibition recommended to me by a friend and was not disappointed. Located just off the Stradun up a side street, so you need to look for it. I was a university student during the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, so my memories have faded somewhat, and it was sobering",
          "War Photo Limited is the best kept gem in Dubrovnik. It's a two-floor installation of photographs with history/context displayed for each one of them. Entrance was cheap (~$5-6) and you'll get one of the more \"real\" experiences you can find in Dubrovnik. It's easy to get",
          "This is an excellent photographic exhibition with images from the Balkans conflict as well as more recent images from Iraq and Syria. Excellent accompanying notes available in multiple languages. Highly recommended.",
          "We managed to see both the new exhibition of Syrian/Iraqi photos, as well as the balkan war exhibition. Well curated, really helpful guide provided, and a thoughtful and evocative reminder of how close we are to a very different way of life from the comfortable, protected world",
          "This exhibition was very compelling, and in my view lifted the museum a notch. Looking at these pictures from a very dramatic time really gives meaning to the saying that a picture says more than a thousand words.",
          "This is a great indoor visit. Either for a rainy day or a very hot one (AC working well). Besides the exhibition of the 90s war, there are also a guest one. Important, but maybe no suitable for small children since the some photos (being war photos) are disturbing.",
          "Could not stop crying. Contained photographs from throughout the Balkan and Iraqi wars. Very graphic and so very sad. It leaves you with a greater appreciation of the city",
          "This museum was a pleasant surprise. In an attempt to avoid the heat, we went in to this museum, and what a museum this is. This is not a feel-good place. A collection of photos and video installations of the Balkan war show the horrors that the people in former Yugoslavia went",
          "As a historian I can highly recommend this small photo museum in Dubrovnik Old Town. You can find it from the one of the sidewalks in the main square. Very touching pictures. Gives you something to think about what is really important in this world: peace!",
          "This is located in an alley off the main road in Old Town. We went to get out of the heat, and enjoyed the visit. Subject matter hard - but worth the visit to understand the Homeland War and issues facing our world today.",
          "Stumbled into this exhibition expecting it to focus on 1991 sad events but found more current focus on Europe's immigration situation.",
          "It was only a generation ago, 20 years, that war was raging in the former Yugoslavia, in particular in Dubrovnik and around. People visiting now this beautiful city and having a good time should also be aware of that and the photos in this gallery are doing precisely this. It's",
          "Majority of the exhibits when visited were to do with refugees travelling through the Balkans to Northern Europe - not really what I expected. Really interesting thou. I found the other part of the displays really great, dealing with the war in and around Dubrovnik 20-25 years",
          "Excellent gallery & exhibition. The initial rooms are currently showing an exhibition of photos covering the refugee crisis on the Balkan Route - interesting & informative. The final section shows images from the wars in the 90s. Amazing to see the contrast on some of the",
          "This was a great museum with photographs of not only the war in Croatia (and especially in Dubrovnik) in the 90s, but also other expositions of other wars such as in the Central African Republic (when I was visiting). This museum made a great impression on me. I would recommend",
          "Outside the streets are brimming with tourists spending money and having fun. In sharp contrast are the searing images inside this museum. I expected more about the war in the Balkans in the 90s but now the majority of images tell the tragic tale of the refugee crisis that",
          "Out of the few museums to be visited, this gallery was my favorite. The impact of its exhibits do bring us to a not too far away history when Dubrovnik was under a siege and gives us a clear idea of what it was like. Strongly recommend it as one of the best cultural options the",
          "In June 2016, the main feature is a thought provoking display on the refugee crisis facing Europe and the insensitivity of authorities to the crisis. Whether you agree with raising barriers or welcoming refugees it does put you in the perspective of the refugees in direct",
          "Currently there is an exposition about the Balkan route and the refugee crisis which was really moving. The museum is not so big, 2 rooms. In one of them, a movie is displayed which is nice but would be better to have a bit more context by a voice-over.",
          "This is a photographic exhibition of not only the most recent Balkan wars but also other more recent conflicts such a Chechnya. As the other reviewers say the photos range from the horrific to the comic. A truly astonishing range of reportage work. One is obviously struck by the",
          "A rainy day activity. Although it sells itself as a photo war museum of the Balkan wars, the majority of the photos are of Syrian refugees. Some good pics, mildly depressing. Prices recently doubled to \u00a34 each (pre-brexit) Prob \u00a35 now.",
          "After 5 days in Dubrovnik we decided to visit this museum also. It is about a war that occured in Dubrovnik and there are really sad pictures. I recommend going only if you managed to see other attraction.",
          "A small museum but highly recommended hard to believe that this beautiful city was subject to such a terrible time so recently",
          "This is a really well put together gallery of thought provoking photographs with a major focus on the current refugee crisis in Europe.",
          "If you're interested in photography and/or historic wars then I can recommend you to visit the War Photo Limited. It displays very harrowing, moving and emotional pictures. The structure itself is also good as you are given a booklet which has the descriptions of each photo as",
          "This place is not for the feint-hearted. The exhibits bring your attention to a very very dark time in Croatia's recent history. If you want a break from sun-fun-laughter-and joy...visit, it is a sobering experience.",
          "Totally worth visiting - and particularly if you are interested in photo/ journalism/ refugee issues. Takes about an hour",
          "A good way to spend at least an hour from the intense heat. These photos should be sent to every leader of every nation for them to consider.....",
          "this is excellent - we spent about 90 minutes and it was well worth it - very good photographs of real issues",
          "very emotional and very imformative as to what happened to the old town of Dubnovrik. Great photos. there was no entry fee which was good.",
          "These photographs demonstrate the personal realities of war. For those of us in North America the geographical distance can also equate to an emotional distance. Seeing the photos in this gallery remind us of the people impacted by the wars. It was sad but very impacting.",
          "Stunning images and succinct information on the Balkans conflicts of the nineties. What we weren't expecting was the compelling and sombering feature exhibit of photos from the current refugee situation in Europe as a result of wars and unrest in the Middle East. The photographs",
          "Photo exhibition which gives the viewer further understanding into the complicated politics of the region & the impact of the wars on the people. A second photographic exhibition reflects on the refugee crisis in the region. Very thought provoking - an important exhibition",
          "Dramatic photos of the refugee crisis and the Bosnian war. Although the photographs do not have descriptions under them on the wall, you can get a booklet with descriptions of each photo at the main desk. The video at the end of the exhibit was dramatic and touching as well.",
          "My husband and I just happened to be having a coffee down a very, very narrow path/street when I saw the sign outside the studio. The walls were hung with photographs of the casualties of the current war in Syria ; refugees on different stages of their passages of escape; some",
          "This museum is a must see in Dubrovnik. When we were there we saw pictures of refugees traveling from Africa to Europe and following their route through the Balkan to northern and western Europe. It was really moving. We also saw pictures of the Yugoslavian war, of which I knew",
          "The images were haunting so I would not recommend this for small children. Parental discretion advised. We found the images moving. Accompanied with detailed information about when and where the photographs were taken.",
          "Excellent exhibit tucked away in Old Town Dubrovnik. Very moving and informative, and I liked that it wasn't too busy or formal.",
          "There is a permanent exhibition highlighting the war in Dubrovnik. The photos are breathtaking and heart wrenching. The temporary exhibit following the Balkan Route beginning in 2013 follows the routes taken by refugees into Europe. The images capture the lack of humanity and",
          "I visited War Photo Limited on a free day in Dubrovnik because it was right around the corner from my hotel. The museum is neat and makes good use of the small space. One could breeze through quickly if in a hurry or take time to read the story and caption for each photo. If you",
          "Unlike the last reviewer I think the whole point of these photos is to capture the pain of war and forced migration. The photos along with their brief descriptions say all that is needed--they are powerful and poignant. If you can't stand the reality of the world that we live",
          "The photos are amazing and the gallery is set out well providing you with narrative the explain each photo. For me it was a little too real though as the photos capture people's pain at a low point in their lives without completing the story.",
          "Thought provoking, eye opening and hard hitting. Definitely worth a visit while you are in Dubvovnik. Would highly recommend q",
          "During our visit to WPL (the entrance fee is 40 kunas) we were able to see 3 exhibitions: 1. The Balkan Route: Average photos, as if they were done by an amateur. 2. Under Siege - Dubrovnik 1991: There weren't many photos exhibited. I guess that is because most of them are",
          "Our visit to War Photo Limited was a very sobering experience. The exhibition was the Balkan Route, the path taken by Syrian and other refugees to other European countries. There is also what appears to be a permanent exhibition on the Balkan war in the 1990s. The exhibits are",
          "All from.the power of photography! We knew there was an exhibition of the 1990s war here and it's hard to believe sitting here now in Dubrovnik the unimaginable happenings a little over 20 years ago. It's a credit to the people of the area they are thriving again so well.",
          "Most moving exhibition which makes one think. Important to see as it allows for a deeper understanding into the current European refugee crisis.",
          "Being a fan of photography and history this was a must visit for when I went to Dubrovnik with my husband. However nothing prepared me for how much of a moving experience this would be. Yes we all see or have seen war images on the t.v. but this does not prepare you for images",
          "We went here thinking we were just going to see a bit of photographic history of the war in the 90's. Before that part it was the here and now photos of the exodus of millions of refugees from Syria,Iraq etc risking everything to get away and make a better life for their",
          "The photos of the Balkan Refugee Crisis were so moving and they really gave the viewer an idea of the scope of the situation and the price that refugees pay trying to get to a better life. The photos of Dubrovnik during the seige were also very moving and gave a sobering history",
          "This is not a happy exhibit but certainly worth visiting if you are interested in the current immigration and refugee cross going on in our world. It was very eye opening and the photographer has captured some stunning shots to capture the essence of the crisis. The exhibit has",
          "Interesting exhibit which seems to change regularly with a permanent display highlighting the civil war. Really worth a visit whilst enjoying a city which was so recently involved in a war.",
          "Went specifically to see the refugee exhibition... powerful images. Wore my toddler son on my back so he couldn't get into any shenanigans. Would definitely recommend!",
          "Very thought provoking photos of both past Yugoslav conflict and also current refugee crisis. Reasonable entry fee too",
          "The first level of this relatively small gallery is given over to images of the current refugee crisis affecting Europe. The pictures are poignant and thought provoking. The upper level covers the war that impacted Dubrovnik a mere 25 years ago; something I remember well from",
          "Lots of information about the recent European refugee crisis and also the war in Yugoslavia. Worth a visit if interested in history/ weather isn't great",
          "One room features a photographic exhibition of the war in the 90s and a very moving series of short films. A slightly larger room has changing exhibitions; when we were there it was about the migration and desperation of refugees in to Europe. I cannot recommend this exhibition",
          "The selection of war photos - the reason for our visit - was very limited, with far more space being devoted to a highly selective, one-sided presentation about 'refugees'. Was most disappointed and could not recommend.",
          "Visited in early June and the main exhibit dealt with the migration crisis in Europe. Really great photos accompanied by thorough descriptions that provide valuable insight into what the photos portray. I am not someone who enjoys typical museums, but this place kept my",
          "Go here to see what horrors we bring about on each other in the name of power, religion and paradoxically freedom. Difficult to believe what was happening in the Balkans less than 25 years ago.",

          "I have never seen photos that have moved me so much. As a generally strong person, I found myself reduced to tears within 5 minutes which was overwhelming and a tad embarrassing. I did also feel slightly uneasy about being a voyeur of the subjects' distress but it was very",
          "The museum has two floors, both mainly dedicated to the current exhibition so there is just a small section (35-50 pictures) that deals with the bombing of Dubrovnik and civil war. I was expecting more on this subject. In addition to photos there are videos playing in the civil",
          "We popped in on a whim just to have a look round... and left understanding why the people in the old city all seem so happy and proud of their stunning home. The photographs tell an amazing story of pride, loss and the strength of human spirit. It was an honor to look at the",

          "This a great venue with various photo exhibitions. The Homeland War is a permanent one, but there was also a very moving one about the refugee crisis in Europe - not to be missed",
          "Looking at the photographs that show how history unfolded is interesting especially when it is possible to walk around the town and appreciate the restoration work carried out at the locations shown in the pictures",
          "We went to this exhibition on a quiet Wednesday afternoon. The majority of the exhibition was dedicated to the route refugees take across the Balkans as well as the permanent exhibition on the Croation War of Independence. The photos and accompanying descriptions were",
          "A very moving couple of hours of brilliant photo journalism of current refugee crisis and 1990's Balkan conflict. Highly recommend taking a couple of hours from the lovely old town to learn about what was happening there only 20 years ago",
          "This is a must if you want to get some understanding of the complex wars of the 90s and the latest migrant crisis The photos are very poignant and the video quite disturbing The expressions of grief from the bereaved are all to familiar to us who look from our relatively calm",

          "Interesting and unique. I didn\u2019t think it was gruesome (there were a few pics of people who had been killed in war though). It was art, in its own way, that told a story. The museum wasn\u2019t big but you could spend hours here because there is \u2026",
          "We really enjoyed visiting this museum and viewing the photographs from from Croatian conflicts and other wars. The special exhibit was on a British photographer who covered the Vietnam war. It included both photos and commentary from the \u2026",
          "This gave us a good break from the shops and beaches. Interesting place. Well looked after and has a friendly dog. Worth visiting and good to do something a bit different. the stories are really touching and the photos do say a million words.",
          "An interesting and moving exhibition, about the right size to take it all in but not be overwhelmed. Cost is ok as well.",

          "Thought provoking and probably the most unbiased museum regarding Balkans conflict",
          "Deeply affecting and well curated. Was brought to tears at many points in the exhibition. I highly recommend a visit and to set aside at minimum 1.5 hours, possibly more due to the breath of the exhibit and need/want to take some time afterwards to reflect and compose yourself.",
          "I wasn't particularly keen on visiting this exhibition, I was encouraged along nevertheless and I have to say that I am so glad that I was. The gallery is set out really well and has some magnificent photos. I highly reccomend visiting this \u2026",
          "Definitely worth a visit. We only had an hour to spend but I wish we had more. It's a very sobering and informative gallery collection of war photography.",

          "Absolutely spell-binding and utterly heartbreaking. The gallery is a must-do in Dubrovnik. \n\nIt would be nice if the photos were arranged chronologically, but you still get a nice introduction to the wars that ravaged the former Yugoslavia.

          "Really well put together exhibition with great information on the history of the region. The building its self is beautiful.",

          "Fantastic photos. Your emotions will stir as you witness secondhand what it is like during an armed conflict. The written guide they provide is great at summarising the relevant conflict and describing the photo. The gallery is a nice manageable size, and the admission price is good value.",

        "wiki": "Ljubljana (UK: , US: , Slovene: [lju\u02c8blj\u00e0\u02d0na] (listen), locally also [lu\u02c8bl\u00e0\u02d0na]; also known by other historical names) is the capital and largest city of Slovenia. It has been the cultural, educational, economic, political, and administrative centre of independent Slovenia since 1991.\nDuring antiquity, a Roman city called Emona stood in the area. Ljubljana itself was first mentioned in the first half of the 12th century. Situated at the middle of a trade route between the northern Adriatic Sea and the Danube region, it was the historical capital of Carniola, one of the Slovene-inhabited parts of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was under Habsburg rule from the Middle Ages until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. After World War II, Ljubljana became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It retained this status until Slovenia became independent in 1991 and Ljubljana became the capital of the newly formed state.\n\n\n== Name and symbol ==\n\nThe origin of the name of the city, Ljubljana, is unclear. In the Middle Ages, both the river and the town were also known by the German name Laibach. This name was in official use as an endonym until 1918, and it remains frequent as a German exonym, both in common speech and official use.  The city is alternatively named Lublana in many English language documents. The city is called Lubiana in Italian, in Latin: Labacum and anciently Aemona.For most scholars, the problem has been in how to connect the Slovene and the German names. The origin from the Slavic ljub- \"to love, like\" was in 2007 supported as the most probable by the linguist Tijmen Pronk, a specialist in comparative Indo-European linguistics and Slovene dialectology, from the University of Leiden. He supported the thesis that the name of the river derived from the name of the settlement. The linguist Silvo Torkar, who specialises in Slovene personal and place names, argued at the same place for the thesis that the name Ljubljana derives from Ljubija, the original name of the Ljubljanica River flowing through it, itself derived from the Old Slavic male name Ljubovid, \"the one of a lovely appearance\". The name Laibach, he claimed, was actually a hybrid of German and Slovene and derived from the same personal name.The symbol of the city is the Ljubljana Dragon. It is depicted on the top of the tower of Ljubljana Castle in the Ljubljana coat of arms and on the Ljubljanica-crossing Dragon Bridge (Zmajski most). It symbolises power, courage, and greatness.\nThere are several explanations on the origin of the Ljubljana Dragon. According to a Slavic myth, the slaying of a dragon releases the waters and ensures the fertility of the earth, and it is thought that the myth is tied to the Ljubljana Marshes, the expansive marshy area that periodically threatens Ljubljana with flooding. According to the celebrated Greek legend, the Argonauts on their return home after having taken the Golden Fleece found a large lake surrounded by a marsh between the present-day towns of Vrhnika and Ljubljana. It was there that Jason struck down a monster. This monster has evolved into the dragon that today is present in the city coat of arms and flag.It is historically more believable that the dragon was adopted from Saint George, the patron of the Ljubljana Castle chapel built in the 15th century. In the legend of Saint George, the dragon represents the old ancestral paganism overcome by Christianity. According to another explanation, related to the second, the dragon was at first only a decoration above the city coat of arms. In the Baroque, it became part of the coat of arms, and in the 19th and especially the 20th century, it outstripped the tower and other elements in importance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nAround 2000 BC, the Ljubljana Marshes in the immediate vicinity of Ljubljana were settled by people living in pile dwellings. Prehistoric pile dwellings and the oldest wooden wheel in the world are among the most notable archeological findings from the marshland. These lake-dwelling people lived through hunting, fishing and primitive agriculture. To get around the marshes, they used dugout canoes made by cutting out the inside of tree trunks. Their archaeological remains, nowadays in the Municipality of Ig, have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since June 2011, in the common nomination of six Alpine states.Later, the area remained a transit point for numerous tribes and peoples, among them the Illyrians, followed by a mixed nation of the Celts and the Illyrians called the Iapydes, and then in the 3rd century BC a Celtic tribe, the Taurisci.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAround 50 BC, the Romans built a military encampment that later became a permanent settlement called Iulia Aemona. This entrenched fort was occupied by the Legio XV Apollinaris. In 452, it was destroyed by the Huns under Attila's orders, and later by the Ostrogoths and the Lombards. Emona housed 5,000\u20136,000 inhabitants and played an important role during numerous battles. Its plastered brick houses, painted in different colours, were already connected to a drainage system.In the 6th century, the ancestors of the Slovenes moved in. In the 9th century, they fell under Frankish domination, while experiencing frequent Magyar raids. Not much is known about the area during the settlement of Slavs in the period between the downfall of Emona and the Early Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe parchment sheet Nomina defunctorum (\"Names of the Dead\"), most probably written in the second half of 1161, mentions the nobleman Rudolf of Tarcento, a lawyer of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, who had bestowed a canon with 20 farmsteads beside the castle of Ljubljana (castrum Leibach) to the Patriarchate. According to the historian Peter \u0160tih's deduction, this happened between 1112 and 1125, thus representing the earliest mention of Ljubljana.Originally owned by a number of possessors, until the first half of the 12th century, the territory south of the Sava where the town of Ljubljana developed gradually became property of the Carinthian family of the Dukes of Sponheim. Urban settlement in Ljubljana started in the second half of the 12th century. At around 1200, market rights were granted to Old Square (Stari trg), which at the time was one of the three districts that Ljubljana originated from. The other two districts were an area called \"Town\" (Mesto), built around the predecessor of the present-day Ljubljana Cathedral at one side of the Ljubljanica River, and New Square (Novi trg) at the other side. The Franciscan Bridge, a predecessor of the present-day Triple Bridge, and the Butchers' Bridge connected the walled areas with wood-made buildings. Ljubljana acquired the town privileges at some time between 1220 and 1243. Seven fires erupted in the town during the Middle Ages. Artisans organised themselves into guilds. The Teutonic Knights, the Conventual Franciscans, and the Franciscans settled in the town. In 1256, when the Carinthian duke Ulrich III of Spanheim became lord of Carniola, the provincial capital was moved from Kamnik to Ljubljana.\nIn the late 1270s, Ljubljana was conquered by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. In 1278, after Ottokar's defeat, it became\u2014together with the rest of Carniola\u2014property of Rudolph of Habsburg. It was administered by the Counts of Gorizia from 1279 until 1335, when it became the capital town of Carniola. Renamed Laibach, it would be owned by the House of Habsburg until 1797. In 1327, the Ljubljana's \"Jewish Quarter\"\u2014now only \"Jewish Street\" (\u017didovska ulica) remains\u2014was established with a synagogue, and lasted until Emperor Maximilian I in 1515 succumbed to medieval antisemitism and expelled Jews from Ljubljana, for which he demanded a certain payment from the town. In 1382, in front of St. Bartholomew's Church in \u0160i\u0161ka, at the time a nearby village, now part of Ljubljana, a peace treaty was signed between the Republic of Venice and Leopold III of Habsburg.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\nIn the 15th century, Ljubljana became recognised for its art, particularly painting and sculpture. The Roman Rite Catholic Diocese of Ljubljana was established in 1461 and the Church of St. Nicholas became the diocesan cathedral. After the 1511 Idrija earthquake, the city was rebuilt in the Renaissance style and a new wall was built around it. Wooden buildings were forbidden after a large fire at New Square in 1524.\nIn the 16th century, the population of Ljubljana numbered 5,000, 70% of whom spoke Slovene as their first language, with most of the rest using German. The first secondary school, public library and printing house opened in Ljubljana. Ljubljana became an important educational centre.From 1529, Ljubljana had an active Slovene Protestant community. After they were expelled in 1598, marking the beginning of the Counter-Reformation, Catholic Bishop Thomas Chr\u00f6n ordered the public burning of eight cartloads of Protestant books.In 1597, Jesuits arrived in the city, followed in 1606 by the Capuchins, to eradicate Protestantism. Only 5% of all the residents of Ljubljana at the time were of Catholic confession, so it took quite a while to make it Catholic again. Jesuits organised the first theatrical productions in the town, fostered the development of Baroque music and established Catholic schools. In the middle and the second half of the 17th century, foreign architects built and renovated numerous monasteries, churches, and palaces in Ljubljana and introduced Baroque architecture. In 1702, the Ursulines settled in the town, where, the following year, they opened the first public school for girls in the Slovene Lands. Some years later, the construction of Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity started. In 1779, St. Christopher's Cemetery replaced the cemetery at St. Peter's Church as the main Ljubljana cemetery.\n\n\n=== Late modern ===\n\nFrom 1809 to 1813, during the Napoleonic interlude, Ljubljana (under the name Laybach) was the capital of the Illyrian Provinces. In 1813, the city became Austrian again and from 1815 to 1849 was the administrative centre of the Kingdom of Illyria in the Austrian Empire. In 1821, it hosted the Congress of Laibach, which fixed European political borders for years to come. The first train arrived in 1849 from Vienna and in 1857 the line was extended to Trieste.In 1895, Ljubljana, then a city of 31,000, suffered a serious earthquake measuring 6.1 degrees Richter and 8\u20139 degrees MCS. Some 10% of its 1,400 buildings were destroyed, although casualties were light. During the reconstruction that followed, a number of districts were rebuilt in the Vienna Secession style. Public electric lighting appeared in the city in 1898. The rebuilding period between 1896 and 1910 is referred to as the \"revival of Ljubljana\" because of architectural changes from which a great deal of the city dates back to today and for reform of urban administration, health, education and tourism that followed. The rebuilding and quick modernisation of the city were led by the mayor Ivan Hribar.In 1918, following the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the region joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1929, Ljubljana became the capital of the Drava Banovina, a Yugoslav province.In 1941, during World War II, Fascist Italy occupied the city, and on 3 May 1941 made Lubiana the capital of Italy's Province of Ljubljana with the former Yugoslav general Leon Rupnik as mayor. After the Italian capitulation, Nazi Germany with SS-general Erwin R\u00f6sener and Friedrich Rainer took control in 1943, but formally the city remained the capital of an Italian province until 9 May 1945. In Ljubljana, the occupying forces established strongholds and command centres of Quisling organisations, the Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia under Italy and the Home Guard under German occupation. Since February 1942, the city was surrounded by barbed wire, later fortified by bunkers, to prevent co-operation between the resistance movement that operated within and outside the fence. Since 1985, the commemorative trail has ringed the city where this iron fence once stood. Postwar reprisals resulted in a number of mass graves in Ljubljana.After World War II, Ljubljana became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It retained this status until Slovenia became independent in 1991.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nLjubljana remains the capital of independent Slovenia, which joined the European Union in 2004.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city, with an area of 163.8 square kilometers (63.2 sq mi), is situated in the Ljubljana Basin in Central Slovenia, between the Alps and the Karst. Ljubljana is located some 320 kilometers (200 mi) south of Munich, 477 kilometers (296 mi) east of Z\u00fcrich, 250 kilometers (160 mi) east of Venice, 350 kilometers (220 mi) southwest of Vienna, 224 kilometers (139 mi) south of Salzburg and 400 kilometers (250 mi) southwest of Budapest. The extent of Ljubljana has changed considerably in the past 40 years, mainly because some of the nearby settlements have merged with Ljubljana.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThe city stretches out on an alluvial plain dating to the Quaternary era. The mountainous regions nearby are older, dating from the Mesozoic (Triassic) or Paleozoic. A number of earthquakes have devastated Ljubljana, including in 1511 and 1895.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLjubljana has an elevation of 295 meters (968 ft) The city centre, located along the Ljubljanica River, has an elevation of 298 meters (978 ft). Ljubljana Castle, which sits atop Castle Hill (Grajski gri\u010d) south of the city centre, has an elevation of 366 meters (1,201 ft). The highest point of the city, called Grmada, reaches 676 meters (2,218 ft), 3 meters (9.8 ft) more than the nearby Mount Saint Mary (\u0160marna gora) peak, a popular hiking destination. These are located in the northern part of the city.\n\n\n=== Bodies of water ===\n\nThe main watercourses in Ljubljana are the Ljubljanica, the Sava, the Grada\u0161\u010dica, the Mali Graben, the I\u0161ka and the I\u0161\u010dica rivers. From the Trnovo District to the Moste District, around Castle Hill, the Ljubljanica partly flows through the Gruber Canal, built according to plans by Gabriel Gruber from 1772 until 1780. Next to the eastern border of the city, the Ljubljanica, the Sava, and the Kamnik Bistrica rivers flow together. The lowest point of Ljubljana, with an elevation of 261 meters (856 ft), is located at the confluence.Through its history, Ljubljana has been struck by floods. The latest was in 2010. Southern and western parts of the city are more flood-endangered than northern parts. The Gruber Canal has partly diminished the danger of floods in the Ljubljana Marshes, the largest marshes in Slovenia, south of Ljubljana.\nThere are two major ponds in Ljubljana. Koseze Pond is located in the \u0160i\u0161ka District and Tivoli Pond is in the southern part of Tivoli City Park. Koseze Pond has a number of rare plant and animal species and is a popular place of meeting and recreation. Tivoli Pond is a shallow pond with a small volume that was originally used for boating and ice skating, but has been abandoned over the years and is now used only for fishing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLjubljana's climate is an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb), bordering on a humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), with continental characteristics such as warm summers and moderately cold winters. July and August are the warmest months with daily highs generally between 25 and 30 \u00b0C (77 and 86 \u00b0F), and January is the coldest month with temperatures mostly oscillating around 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). The city experiences 90 days of frost per year, and 11 days with temperatures above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). The precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the seasons, although winter and spring tend to be somewhat drier than summer and autumn. Yearly precipitation is about 1,400 mm (55 in), making Ljubljana one of the wettest European capitals. Thunderstorms are very common from May to September and can occasionally be quite heavy. Snow is common from December to February; on average, there are 48 days with snow cover recorded each winter season. The city is known for its fog, which is recorded on average on 64 days per year, mostly in autumn and winter, and can be particularly persistent in conditions of temperature inversion.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city's architecture is a mix of styles. Despite the appearance of large buildings, especially at the city's edge, Ljubljana's historic centre remains intact. Although the oldest architecture has been preserved from the Roman period, Ljubljana's downtown got its outline in the Middle Ages. After the 1511 earthquake, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style following Italian, particularly Venetian, models.\nAfter the quake in 1895, it was once again rebuilt, this time in the Vienna Secession style, which today is juxtaposed against the earlier Baroque style buildings that remain. Large sectors built in the inter-war period often include a personal touch by the architects Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik and Ivan Vurnik. In the second half of the 20th century, parts of Ljubljana were redesigned by Edvard Ravnikar.\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\nThe central square in Ljubljana is Pre\u0161eren Square (Pre\u0161ernov trg) where the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation (Fran\u010di\u0161kanska cerkev) is located. Built between 1646 and 1660 (the belltowers following later), it replaced an older Gothic church on the same site. The layout takes the form of an early-Baroque basilica with one nave and two rows of lateral chapels. The Baroque main altar was executed by the sculptor Francesco Robba. Much of the original frescos were ruined by the cracks in the ceiling caused by the Ljubljana earthquake in 1895. The new frescos were painted by the Slovene impressionist painter Matej Sternen.\nLjubljana Castle (Ljubljanski grad) is a medieval castle with Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architectural elements, located on the summit of Castle Hill, which dominates the city centre. The area surrounding today's castle has been continuously inhabited since 1200 BC. The castle was built in the 12th century and was a residence of the Margraves, later the Dukes of Carniola. The castle's Viewing Tower dates to 1848; this was manned by a guard whose duty it was to fire cannons warning the city in case of fire or announcing important visitors or events, a function the castle still holds today. Cultural events and weddings also take place there. Since 2006, a funicular has linked the city centre to the castle atop the hill.\n\nTown Hall (Mestna hi\u0161a, Magistrat), located at Town Square, is the seat of the City Municipality of Ljubljana. The original building was built in a Gothic style in 1484. Between 1717 and 1719, the building underwent a Baroque renovation with a Venetian inspiration by the architect Gregor Ma\u010dek Sr.. Near Town Hall, at Town Square, stands a replica of the Baroque Robba Fountain. The original has been moved into the National Gallery in 2006. The Robba Fountain is decorated with an obelisk at the foot of which there are three figures in white marble symbolising the three chief rivers of Carniola. It is work of Francesco Robba, who designed numerous other Baroque statues in the city.Ljubljana Cathedral (ljubljanska stolnica), or St. Nicholas's Cathedral (stolnica sv. Nikolaja), serves the Archdiocese of Ljubljana. Easily identifiable due to its green dome and twin towers, it is located at Cyril and Methodius Square (Ciril-Metodov trg, named for Saints Cyril and Methodius) by the nearby Ljubljana Central Market and Town Hall. The Diocese of Ljubljana was set up in 1461. Between 1701 and 1706, the Jesuit architect Andrea Pozzo designed the Baroque church with two side chapels shaped in the form of a Latin cross. The dome was built in the centre in 1841. The interior is decorated with Baroque frescos painted by Giulio Quaglio between 1703\u20131706 and 1721\u20131723.Neboti\u010dnik (pronounced [n\u025bb\u0254ti\u02d0t\u0283ni\u02d0k], \"Skyscraper\") is a thirteen-story building that rises to a height of 70.35 m (231 ft). It combines elements of the Neoclassical and the Art-Deco architecture. Predominantly a place of business, Neboti\u010dnik is home to a variety of shops on the ground floor and first story, and various offices are located on floors two to five. The sixth to ninth floors are private residences. Located on the top three floors are a caf\u00e9, bar and observation deck. It was designed by the Slovenian architect Vladimir \u0160ubic. Construction began in July 1930 and the building opened on 21 February 1933. It was for some time the tallest residential building in Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and other green spaces ===\nTivoli City Park (Mestni park Tivoli) is the largest park in Ljubljana. It was designed in 1813 by the French engineer Jean Blanchard and now covers approximately 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi). The park was laid out during the French imperial administration of Ljubljana in 1813 and named after the Parisian Jardins de Tivoli. Between 1921 and 1939, it was renovated by the Slovene architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, who unveiled his statue of Napoleon in 1929 in Republic Square and designed a broad central promenade, called the Jakopi\u010d Promenade (Jakopi\u010devo sprehajali\u0161\u010de) after the leading Slovene impressionist painter Rihard Jakopi\u010d. Within the park, there are different types of trees, flower gardens, several statues, and fountains. Several notable buildings stand in the park, among them Tivoli Castle, the National Museum of Contemporary History and the Tivoli Sports Hall.Tivoli\u2013Ro\u017enik Hill\u2013\u0160i\u0161ka Hill Landscape Park is located in the western part of the city.The Ljubljana Botanical Garden (Ljubljanski botani\u010dni vrt) covers 2.40 hectares (5.9 acres) next to the junction of the Gruber Canal and the Ljubljanica, south of the Old Town. It is the central Slovenian botanical garden and the oldest cultural, scientific, and educational organisation in the country. It started operating under the leadership of Franc Hladnik in 1810. Of over 4,500 plant species and subspecies, roughly a third is endemic to Slovenia, whereas the rest originate from other European places and other continents. The institution is a member of the international network Botanic Gardens Conservation International and cooperates with more than 270 botanical gardens all across the world.In 2014, Ljubljana won the European Green Capital Award for 2016 for its environmental achievements.\n\n\n=== Streets and squares ===\n\nExisting already in the 18th century, the Ljubljana central square, the Pre\u0161eren Square's modern appearance has developed since the end of the 19th century. After the 1895 earthquake, Max Fabiani designed the square as the hub of four streets and four banks, and in the 1980s, Edvard Ravnikar proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement. A statue of the Slovene national poet France Pre\u0161eren with a muse stands in the middle of the square. The Pre\u0161eren Monument was created by Ivan Zajec in 1905, whereas the pedestal was designed by Max Fabiani. The square and surroundings have been closed to traffic since 1 September 2007. Only a tourist train leaves Pre\u0161eren Square every day, transporting tourists to Ljubljana Castle.Republic Square, at first named Revolution Square, is the largest square in Ljubljana. It was designed in the second half of the 20th century by Edvard Ravnikar. On 26 June 1991, the independence of Slovenia was declared here. The National Assembly Building stands at its northern side, and Cankar Hall, the largest Slovenian cultural and congress centre, at the southern side. At its eastern side stands the two-storey building of Maximarket, also work of Ravnikar. It houses one of the oldest department stores in Ljubljana and a cafe, which is a popular meeting place and a place of political talks and negotiations.Congress Square (Kongresni trg) is one of the most important centres of the city. It was built in 1821 for ceremonial purposes such as Congress of Ljubljana after which it was named. Since then it became an important centre for political ceremonies, demonstrations and protests, such as the ceremony at creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, ceremony of liberation of Belgrade, protests against Yugoslav authority in 1988 etc. The square also houses several important buildings, such as the University of Ljubljana Palace, Philharmonic Hall, Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity, and the Slovene Society Building. Star Park (Park Zvezda) is located in the centre of the square. In 2010 and 2011, the square was heavily renovated and is now mostly closed to road traffic on ground area, however there are five floors for commercial purposes and a parking lot located underground.\u010cop Street (\u010copova ulica) is a major thoroughfare in the centre of Ljubljana. The street is named after Matija \u010cop, an early 19th-century literary figure and close friend of the Slovene Romantic poet France Pre\u0161eren. It leads from the Main Post Office (Glavna po\u0161ta) at Slovene Street (Slovenska cesta) downward to Pre\u0161eren Square and is lined with bars and stores, including the oldest McDonald's restaurant in Slovenia. It is a pedestrian zone and regarded as the capital's central promenade.\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\nLjubljana's most known bridges, listed from northern to southern ones, include the Dragon Bridge (Zmajski most), the Butchers' Bridge (Mesarski most), the Triple Bridge (Tromostovje), the Fish Footbridge (Slovene: Ribja brv), the Cobblers' Bridge (Slovene: \u0160u\u0161tarski most), the Hradecky Bridge (Slovene: Hradeckega most), and the Trnovo Bridge (Trnovski most). The last mentioned crosses the Grada\u0161\u010dica, whereas all other bridges cross the Ljubljanica River.\n\n\n==== The Dragon Bridge ====\n\nThe 1901 Dragon Bridge, decorated with the Dragon statues on pedestals at four corners of the bridge has become a symbol of the city and is regarded as one of the most beautiful examples of a bridge made in Vienna Secession style. It has a span of 33.34 meters (109 ft 5 in) and its arch was at the time the third largest in Europe. It is protected as a technical monument.\n\n\n==== The Butchers' Bridge ====\n\nDecorated with mythological bronze sculptures, created by Jakov Brdar, from Ancient Greek mythology and Biblical stories, the Butchers' Bridge connects the Ljubljana Open Market area and the restaurants-filled Petkov\u0161ek Embankment (Petkov\u0161kovo nabre\u017eje). It is also known as the love padlocks-decorated bridge in Ljubljana.\n\n\n==== The Triple Bridge ====\n\nThe Triple Bridge is decorated with stone balusters and stone lamps on all of the three bridges and leads to the terraces looking on the river and poplar trees. It occupies a central point on the east-west axis, connecting the Tivoli City Park with Ro\u017enik Hill, on one side, and the Ljubljana Castle on the other, and the north-south axis through the city, represented by the river. It was enlarged in order to prevent the historically single bridge from being a bottleneck by adding two side pedestrian bridges to the middle one.\n\n\n==== The Fish Footbridge ====\nThe Fish Footbridge offers a good view of the neighbouring Triple Bridge to the north and the Cobbler's Bridge to the south of it. It is a transparent glass-made bridge, which is illuminated at night by in-built LEDs. From 1991 to 2014 the bridge was a wooden one and decorated with flowers, while since its reconstruction in 2014, it is made of glass. It was planned already in 1895 by Max Fabiani to build a bridge on the location, in 1913 Alfred Keller planned a staircase, later Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik incorporated both into his own plans which, however, were not realised.\n\n\n==== The Cobbler's Bridge ====\nThe 1930 'Cobblers' Bridge' (\u0160u\u0161tarski, from German Schuster \u2013 Shoemaker) is another Ple\u010dnik's creation, connecting two major areas of medieval Ljubljana. It is decorated by two kinds of pillars, the Corinthian pillars which delineate the shape of the bridge itself and the Ionic pillars as lamp-bearers.\n\n\n==== The Trnovo Bridge ====\n\nThe Trnovo Bridge is the most prominent object of Ple\u010dnik's renovation of the banks of the Grada\u0161\u010dica. It is located in the front of the Trnovo Church to the south of the city centre. It connects the neighbourhoods of Krakovo and Trnovo, the oldest Ljubljana suburbs, known for their market gardens and cultural events. It was built between 1929 and 1932. It is distinguished by its width and two rows of birches that it bears, because it was meant to serve as a public space in front of the church. Each corner of the bridge is capped with a small pyramid, a signature motif of Ple\u010dnik's, whereas the mid-span features a pair of Art-Deco male sculptures. There is also a statue of Saint John the Baptist on the bridge, the patron of the Trnovo Church. It was designed by Nikolaj Pirnat.\n\n\n==== The Hradecky Bridge ====\n\nThe Hradecky Bridge is one of the first hinged bridges in the world, the first the only preserved cast iron bridge in Slovenia, and one of its most highly valued technical achievements. It has been situated on an extension of Hren Street (Hrenova ulica), between the Krakovo Embankment (Krakovski nasip) and the Gruden Embankment (Grudnovo nabre\u017eje), connecting the Trnovo District and the Prule neighbourhood in the Center District. The Hradecky Bridge was manufactured according to the plans of the senior engineer Johann Hermann from Vienna in the Auersperg iron foundry in Dvor near \u017du\u017eemberk, and installed in Ljubljana in 1867, at the location of today's Cobblers' Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Accent ===\nLjubljana accent and/or dialect (Slovene: ljubljan\u0161\u010dina [lu\u02d0bl\u0251\u02d0\u014b\u0283n\u0251\u02d0] (listen)) is considered border dialect, since Ljubljana is situated where Upper dialect and Lower Carniolan dialect group meet. Historically Ljubljana dialect in the past displayed features more similar with the Lower Carniolan dialect group, but it gradually grew closer to the Upper dialect group, as a direct consequence of mass migration from Gorenjska region into Ljubljana in the 19th and 20th century. Ljubljana as a city grew mostly to the north, and gradually incorporated many villages that were historically part of Upper Carniola and so its dialect shifted away and closer to Upper dialects.  The Ljubljana dialect has also been used as literary means in novels, such as in the novel Nekdo drug by Branko Gradi\u0161nik, or in poems, such as Pika Nogavi\u010dka (Slovene for Pippi Longstocking) by Andrej Rozman - Roza.The central position of Ljubljana and its dialect had crucial impact on the development of Slovenian language. It was the speech of 16th century Ljubljana that Primo\u017e Trubar a Slovenian Protestant Reformer  took as a foundation of what later became standard Slovenian language, with small addition of his native speech, that is Lower Carniolan dialect. While in Ljubljana, he lived in a house, on today's Ribji trg, in the oldest part of the city. Living in Ljubljana had profound impact on his work, he considered Ljubljana the capital of all Slovenes, not only because of its central position in the heart of the Slovene lands, but also because it always had an essentially Slovene character. Most of its inhabitants spoke Slovene as their mother tongue, unlike other cites in today's Slovenia. It is estimated that in Trubar's period around 70% of Ljubljana's 4000 inhabitants attended mass in Slovene language. Trubar considered Ljubljana's speech most suitable, since it sounded much more noble, than his own, simple dialect of his hometown Ra\u0161ica. Trubar's choice  was later adopted also by other Protestant writers in the 16th century, and ultimately led to a formation of more standard language.\n\n\n=== In literary fiction ===\nLjubljana appears in the 2005 The Historian, written by Elisabeth Kostova, and is called by its Roman name (Emona).Ljubljana is also the setting of Paulo Coelho's 1998 novel Veronika Decides to Die.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nEach year, over 10,000 cultural events take place in the city, including ten international theatre, music, and art festivals. The Ljubljana Festival is one of the two oldest festivals in former Yugoslavia (the Dubrovnik Summer Festival was established in 1950, and the Ljubljana Festival one in 1953). Guests have included Dubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d, Marjana Lipov\u0161ek, Toma\u017e Pandur, Katia Ricciarelli, Grace Bumbry, Yehudi Menuhin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Jos\u00e9 Carreras, Slid Hampton, Zubin Mehta, Vadim Repin, Valerij Gergijev, Sir Andrew Davis, Danjulo I\u0161izaka, Midori, Jurij Ba\u0161met, Ennio Morricone, and Manhattan Transfer. Orchestras have included the New York Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestras of the Bolshoi Theatre from Moscow, La Scala from Milan, and Mariinsky Theatre from Saint Petersburg. In recent years there have been 80 different kinds of events and some 80,000 visitors from Slovenia and abroad. Other cultural venues include Kri\u017eanke, Cankar Hall and the Exhibition and Convention Centre. During Book Week, starting each year on World Book Day, events and book sales take place at Congress Square. A flea market is held every Sunday in the old city. On the evening of International Workers' Day, a celebration with a bonfire takes place on Ro\u017enik Hill.\n\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\n\nLjubljana has numerous art galleries and museums. The first purpose-built art gallery in Ljubljana was the Jakopi\u010d Pavilion, which was in the first half of the 20th century the central exhibition venue of Slovene artists. In the early 1960s, it was succeeded by the Ljubljana City Art Gallery, which has presented a number of modern Slovene and foreign artists. In 2010, there were 14 museums and 56 art galleries in Ljubljana. There is for example an architecture museum, a railway museum, a school museum, a sports museum, a museum of modern art, a museum of contemporary art, a brewery museum, the Slovenian Museum of Natural History and the Slovene Ethnographic Museum. The National Gallery (Narodna galerija), founded in 1918, and the Museum of Modern Art (Moderna galerija) exhibit the most influential Slovenian artists. In 2006, the museums received 264,470 visitors, the galleries 403,890 and the theatres 396,440. The Metelkova Museum of Contemporary Art (Muzej sodobne umetnosti Metelkova), opened in 2011, hosts various simultaneous exhibitions, a research library, archives, and a bookshop.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nCankar Hall is the largest Slovenian cultural and congress center with multiple halls and a large foyer in which art film festivals, artistic performances, book fairs, and other cultural events are held.\n\n\n==== Cinema ====\nThe cinema in Ljubljana appeared for the first time at the turn of the 20th century, and quickly gained popularity among the residents. After World War II, the Cinema Company Ljubljana, later named Ljubljana Cinematographers, was established and managed a number of already functioning movie theatres in Ljubljana, including the only Yugoslav children's theatre. A number of cinema festivals took place in the 1960s, and a cinematheque opened its doors in 1963. With the advent of television, video, and recently the Internet, most cinema theatres in Ljubljana closed, and the cinema mainly moved to Kolosej, a multiplex in the BTC City. It features twelve screens, including an IMAX 3D screen. The remaining theatres are Kino Komuna, Kinodvor, where art movies are accompanied by events, and the Slovenian Cinematheque.\n\n\n==== Classical music, opera and ballet ====\nThe Slovenian Philharmonics is the central music institution in Ljubljana and Slovenia. It holds classical music concerts of domestic and foreign performers as well as educates youth. It was established in 1701 as part of Academia operosorum Labacensis and is among the oldest such institutions in Europe. The Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre also resides in Ljubljana, presenting a wide variety of domestic and foreign, modern and classic, opera, ballet and concert works. It serves as the national opera and ballet house. Numerous music festivals are held in Ljubljana, chiefly in European classical music and jazz, for instance the Ljubljana Summer Festival (Ljubljanski poletni festival), and Trnfest.\n\n\n==== Theatre ====\nIn addition to the main houses, with the SNT Drama Ljubljana as the most important among them, a number of small producers are active in Ljubljana, involved primarily in physical theatre (e.g. Betontanc), street theatre (e.g. Ana Monr\u00f3 Theatre), theatresports championship Impro League, and improvisational theatre (e.g. IGLU Theatre). A popular form is puppetry, mainly performed in the Ljubljana Puppet Theatre. Theatre has a rich tradition in Ljubljana, starting with the 1867 first ever Slovene-language drama performance.\n\n\n==== Modern dance ====\nThe modern dance was presented in Ljubljana for the first time at the end of the 19th century and developed rapidly since the end of the 1920s. Since the 1930s when in Ljubljana was founded a Mary Wigman dance school, the first one for modern dance in Slovenia, the field has been intimately linked to the development in Europe and the United States. Ljubljana Dance Theatre is today the only venue in Ljubljana dedicated to contemporary dance. Despite this, there's a vivid happening in the field.\n\n\n==== Folk dance ====\nSeveral folk dance groups are active in Ljubljana.\n\n\n==== Jazz ====\nIn July 2015, over four days, the 56th Ljubljana Jazz Festival took place. A member of the European Jazz Network, the festival presented 19 concerts featuring artists from 19 countries, including a celebration of the 75th anniversary of James Blood Ulmer.\n\n\n=== Popular urban culture and alternative scene ===\n\nIn the 1980s with the emergence of subcultures in Ljubljana, an alternative culture begun to develop in Ljubljana organised around two student organisations. This caused an influx of young people to the city centre, caused political and social changes, and led to the establishment of alternative art centres.\nMetelkova and RogA Ljubljana equivalent of the Copenhagen's Freetown Christiania, a self-proclaimed autonomous Metelkova neighbourhood, was set up in a former Austro-Hungarian barracks that were built in 1882 (completed in 1911).In 1993, the seven buildings and 12,500 m2 of space were turned into art galleries, artist studios, and seven nightclubs, including two LGBTQ+ venues, playing host to all range of music from hardcore to jazz to dub to techno. Adjacent to the Metelkova are located the Celica Hostel with rooms all artistically decorated by the Metelkova artists, and a new part of the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Contemporary Art. Another alternative culture centre is located in the former Rog factory. Both Metelkova and Rog factory factory located in Tabor neighbourhood are walking distance from the city centre and visited by various tours.\n\n\u0160i\u0161ka Cultural QuarterThe \u0160i\u0161ka Cultural Quarter hosts a number of art groups and cultural organisations dedicated to contemporary and avant-garde arts. Part of it is also Kino \u0160i\u0161ka Centre for Urban Culture, a venue where music concerts of indie, punk, and rock bands as well as exhibitions take place. Museum of Transitory Art (MoTA) is a museum without a permanent collection or a fixed space. Instead, its programs are realised in different locations and contexts in temporary physical and virtual spaces dedicated to advancing the research, production and presentation of transitory, experimental, and live art forms. Yearly MoTA organises Sonica Festival. Ljudmila (since 1994) strives to connect research practices, technologies, science, and art.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Clubs ===\nA tension between German and Slovene residents dominated the development of sport of Ljubljana in the 19th century. The first sport club in Ljubljana was the South Sokol Gymnastic Club (Gimnasti\u010dno dru\u0161tvo Ju\u017eni Sokol), established in 1863 and succeeded in 1868 by the Ljubljana Sokol (Ljubljanski Sokol). It was the parent club of all Slovene Sokol clubs as well as an encouragement for the establishment of the Croatian Sokol club in Zagreb. Members were also active in culture and politics, striving for greater integration of the Slovenes from different Crown lands of Austria\u2013Hungary and for their cultural, political, and economic independence.\nIn 1885, German residents established the first sports club in the territory of nowadays Slovenia, Der Laibacher Byciklistischer Club (Ljubljana Cycling Club). In 1887, Slovene cyclists established the Slovene Cyclists Club (Slovenski biciklisti\u010dni klub). In 1893 followed the first Slovene Alpine club, named Slovene Alpine Club (Slovensko planinsko dru\u0161tvo), later succeeded by the Alpine Association of Slovenia (Planinska zveza Slovenije). Several of its branches operate in Ljubljana, the largest of them being the Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club (Planinsko dru\u0161tvo Ljubljana-Matica). In 1900, the sports club Laibacher Sportverein (English: Ljubljana Sports Club) was established by the city's German residents and functioned until 1909. In 1906, Slovenes organised themselves in its Slovene counterpart, the Ljubljana Sports Club (Ljubljanski \u0161portni klub). Its members were primarily interested in rowing, but also swimming and football. In 1911, the first Slovene football club, Ilirija, started operating in the city. Winter sports started to develop in the area of the nowadays Ljubljana already before World War II. In 1929, the first ice hockey club in Slovenia (then Yugoslavia) SK Ilirija was established.\nNowadays, the city's football team which plays in the Slovenian PrvaLiga is NK Olimpija Ljubljana. Ljubljana's ice hockey clubs are HK Slavija and HK Olimpija. They both compete in the Slovenian Hockey League. The basketball teams are KD Slovan and KK Cedevita Olimpija. The latter, which has a green dragon as its mascot, hosts its matches at the 12,480-seat Arena Sto\u017eice. Handball is more or less popular in female section. RK Krim is one of the best women handball team in Europe. They won EHF Champions League twice, also 2nd and 3rd places are not a rare thing. AMTK Ljubljana is the most successful speedway club in Slovenia. The Ljubljana Sports Club has been succeeded by the Livada Canoe and Kayak Club.\n\n\n=== Mass sport activities ===\n\nEach year since 1957, on 8\u201310 May, the traditional recreational Walk Along the Wire has taken place to mark the liberation of Ljubljana on 9 May 1945. At the same occasion, a triples competition is run on the trail, and a few days later, a student run from Pre\u0161eren Square to Ljubljana Castle is held. The last Sunday in October, the Ljubljana Marathon and a few minor competition runs take place on the city streets. The event attracts several thousand runners each year.\n\n\n=== Sport venues ===\n\nThe Sto\u017eice Stadium, opened since August 2010 and located in Sto\u017eice Sports Park in the Be\u017eigrad District, is the biggest football stadium in the country and the home of the NK Olimpija Ljubljana. It is one of the two main venues of Slovenia national football team. The park also has an indoor arena, used for indoor sports such as basketball, handball and volleyball and is the home venue of KK Olimpija, RK Krim and ACH Volley Bled among others. Beside football, the stadium is designed to host cultural events as well. Another stadium in the Be\u017eigrad district, Be\u017eigrad Stadium, is closed since 2008 and is deteriorating. It was built according to the plans of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik and was the home of the NK Olimpija Ljubljana, dissolved in 2004. Joc Pe\u010de\u010dnik, a Slovenian multimillionaire, plans to renovate it.Ljubljana Sports Park is located in Spodnja \u0160i\u0161ka, part of the \u0160i\u0161ka District. It has a football stadium with five courts, an athletic hall, outdoor athletic areas, tennis courts, a Boules court, and a sand volleyball court. The majority of competitions are in athletics. Another sports park in Spodnja \u0160i\u0161ka is Ilirija Sports Park, known primarily for its stadium with a speedway track. At the northern end of Tivoli Park stands the Ilirija Swimming Pool Complex, which was built as part of a swimming and athletics venue following plans by Bloudek in the 1930s and has been nearly abandoned since then, but there are plans to renovate it.\nA number of sport venues are located in Tivoli Park. An outdoor swimming pool in Tivoli, constructed by Bloudek in 1929, was the first Olympic-size swimming pool in Yugoslavia. Currently, the Tivoli Recreational Centre in Tivoli is Ljubljana's largest recreational centre and has three swimming pools, saunas, a Boules court, a health club, and other facilities. There are two skating rinks, a basketball court, a winter ice rink, and ten tennis courts in its outdoor area. The Tivoli Hall consists of two halls. The smaller one accepts 4,050 spectators and is used for basketball matches. The larger one can accommodate 6,000 spectators and is primarily used for hockey, but also for basketball matches. The halls are also used for concerts and other cultural events. The Slovenian Olympic Committee has its office in the building.The Tacen Whitewater Course, located on a course on the Sava, 8 kilometers (5 miles) northwest of the city centre, hosts a major international canoe/kayak slalom competition almost every year, examples being the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in 1955, 1991, and 2010.Since the 1940s, a ski slope has been in use in Gunclje, in the northwestern part of the city. It is 600 meters (2,000 ft) long and has two ski lifts, its maximum incline is 60\u00b0 and the difference in height from the top to the bottom is 155 meters (509 ft). Five ski jumping hills stand near the ski slope. Several Slovenian Olympic and World Cup medalists trained and competed there. In addition, the Arena Triglav complex of six jumping hills is located in the \u0160i\u0161ka District. A ski jumping hill, build in 1954 upon the plans by Stanko Bloudek, was located in \u0160i\u0161ka near Vodnik Street (Vodnikova cesta) until 1976. International competitions for the Kongsberg Cup were held there, attended by thousands of spectators. The ice rinks in Ljubljana include Koseze Pond and Tivoli Hall. In addition, in the 19th century and the early 20th century, Tivoli Pond and a marshy meadow in Trnovo, named Kern, were used for ice skating.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry remains the most important employer, notably in the pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and food processing. Other fields include banking, finance, transport, construction, skilled trades and services and tourism. The public sector provides jobs in education, culture, health care and local administration.The Ljubljana Stock Exchange (Ljubljanska borza), purchased in 2008 by the Vienna Stock Exchange, deals with large Slovenian companies. Some of these have their headquarters in the capital: for example, the retail chain Mercator, the oil company Petrol d.d. and the telecommunications concern Telekom Slovenije. Over 15,000 enterprises operate in the city, most of them in the tertiary sector.Numerous companies and over 450 shops are located in the BTC City, the largest business, shopping, recreational, entertainment and cultural centre in Slovenia. It is visited each year by 21 million people. It occupies an area of 475,000 square meters (5,110,000 sq ft) in the Moste District in the eastern part of Ljubljana.About 74% of Ljubljana households use district heating from the Ljubljana Power Station.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe city of Ljubljana is governed by the City Municipality of Ljubljana (Slovene: Mestna ob\u010dina Ljubljana; MOL), which is led by the city council. The president of the city council is called the mayor. Members of the city council and the mayor are elected in the local election, held every four years. Among other roles, the city council drafts the municipal budget, and is assisted by various boards active in the fields of health, sports, finances, education, environmental protection and tourism. The municipality is subdivided into 17 districts represented by district councils. They work with the municipality council to make known residents' suggestions and prepare activities in their territories.Between 2002 and 2006, Danica Sim\u0161i\u010d was mayor of the municipality. Since the municipal elections of 22 October 2006 until his confirmation as a deputy in the National Assembly of Slovenian in December 2011, Zoran Jankovi\u0107, previously the managing director of the Mercator retail chain, was the mayor of Ljubljana. In 2006, he won 62.99% of the popular vote. On 10 October 2010, Jankovi\u0107 was re-elected for another four-year term with 64.79% of the vote. From 2006 until October 2010, the majority on the city council (the Zoran Jankovi\u0107 List) held 23 of 45 seats. On 10 October 2010, Jankovi\u0107's list won 25 out of 45 seats in the city council. From December 2011 onwards, when Jankovi\u0107's list won the early parliamentary election, the deputy mayor Ale\u0161 \u010cerin was decided by him to lead the municipality. \u010cerin did not hold the post of mayor. After Jankovi\u0107 had failed to be elected as the Prime Minister in the National Assembly, he participated at the mayoral by-election on 25 March 2012 and was elected for the third time with 61% of the vote. He retook the leadership of the city council on 11 April 2012.Public order in Ljubljana is enforced by the Ljubljana Police Directorate (Policijska uprava Ljubljana). There are five areal police stations and four sectoral police stations in Ljubljana. Public order and municipal traffic regulations are also supervised by the city traffic wardens (Mestno redarstvo). Ljubljana has a quiet and secure reputation.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1869, Ljubljana had about 22,600 inhabitants, a figure that grew to almost 60,000 by 1931.At the 2002 census, 39% of Ljubljana inhabitants were Catholic; 30% had no religion, an unknown religion or did not reply; 19% atheist; 6% Eastern Orthodox; 5% Muslim; and the remaining 0.7% Protestant or another religion.Approximately 91% of the population speaks Slovene as their primary native language. The second most-spoken language is Bosnian, with Serbo-Croatian being the third most-spoken language.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary education ===\nIn Ljubljana today there are over 50 public elementary schools with over 20,000 pupils. This also includes an international elementary school for foreign pupils. There are two private elementary schools: a Waldorf elementary school and a Catholic elementary school. In addition, there are several elementary music schools.\nHistorically the first school in Ljubljana belonged to Teutonic Knights and was established in the 13th century. It originally accepted only boys; girls were accepted from the beginning of the 16th century. Parochial schools are attested in the 13th century, at St. Peter's Church and at Saint Nicholas's Church, the later Ljubljana Cathedral. Since 1291, there were also trade-oriented private schools in Ljubljana. In the beginning of the 17th century, there were six schools in Ljubljana and later three. A girls' school was established by Poor Clares, followed in 1703 by the Ursulines. Their school was for about 170 years the only public girls' school in Carniola. These schools were mainly private or established by the city.In 1775, the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa proclaimed elementary education obligatory and Ljubljana got its normal school, intended as a learning place for teachers. In 1805, the first state music school was established in Ljubljana. In the time of Illyrian Provinces, \"\u00e9cole primaire\", a unified four-year elementary school program with a greater emphasis on Slovene, was introduced. The first public schools, unrelated to religious education, appeared in 1868.\n\n\n=== Secondary education ===\n\nCurrently in Ljubljana there are ten public and three private grammar schools. The public schools divide into general gymnasiums and classical gymnasiums, the latter offering Latin and Greek as foreign languages. Some general schools offer internationally oriented European departments, and some offer sport departments, allowing students to more easily adjust their sport and school obligations. All state schools are free, but the number of students they can accept is limited. The private secondary schools include a Catholic grammar school and a Waldorf grammar school. There are also professional grammar schools in Ljubljana, offering economical, technical, or artistic subjects (visual arts, music). All grammar schools last four years and conclude with the matura exam.\nHistorically, upon a proposal by Primo\u017e Trubar, the Carniolan Estates' School (1563\u20131598) was established in 1563 in the period of Slovene Reformation. Its teaching languages were mainly Latin and Greek, but also German and Slovene, and it was open for both sexes and all social strata. In 1597, Jesuits established the Jesuit College (1597\u20131773), intended to transmit general education. In 1773, secondary education came under the control of the state. A number of reforms were implemented in the 19th century; there was more emphasis on general knowledge and religious education was removed from state secondary schools. In 1910, there were 29 secondary schools in Ljubljana, among them classical and real gymnasiums and Realschules (technical secondary schools).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\n\nIn 2011, the University had 23 faculties and three academies, located in different parts of Ljubljana. They offer Slovene-language courses in medicine, applied sciences, arts, law, administration, natural sciences, and other subjects. The university has more than 63,000 students and some 4,000 teaching faculty. Students make up one-seventh of Ljubljana's population, giving the city a youthful character.Historically, higher schools offering the study of general medicine, surgery, architecture, law and theology, started to operate in Ljubljana during the French occupation of the Slovene Lands, in 1810\u201311. Austro-Hungarian Empire never allowed Slovenes to establish their own university in Ljubljana and the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia's most important university, was founded in 1919 after Slovenes joined the first Yugoslavia. When it was founded, the university comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. From the beginning, the seat of the university has been at Congress Square in a building that served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nNational and University Library of SloveniaThe National and University Library of Slovenia is the Slovene national and university library. In 2011, it held about 1,307,000 books, 8,700 manuscripts, and numerous other textual, visual and multimedia resources, altogether 2,657,000 volumes.\nCentral Technological LibraryThe second largest university library in Ljubljana is the Central Technological Library, the national library and information hub for natural sciences and technology.\n\nMunicipal Library and other librariesThe Municipal City Library of Ljubljana, established in 2008, is the central regional library and the largest Slovenian general public library. In 2011, it held 1,657,000 volumes, among these 1,432,000 books and a multitude of other resources in 36 branches. Altogether, there are 5 general public libraries and over 140 specialised libraries in Ljubljana.Besides the two largest university libraries there are a number of libraries at individual faculties, departments and institutes of the University of Ljubljana. The largest among them are the Central Humanist Library in the field of humanities, the Central Social Sciences Library, the Central Economic Library in the field of economics, the Central Medical Library in the field of medical sciences, and the Libraries of the Biotechnical Faculty in the field of biology and biotechnology.\nHistoryThe first libraries in Ljubljana were located in monasteries. The first public library was the Carniolan Estates' Library, established in 1569 by Primo\u017e Trubar. In the 17th century, the Jesuit Library collected numerous works, particularly about mathematics. In 1707, the Seminary Library was established; it is the first and oldest public scientific library in Slovenia. Around 1774, after the dissolution of Jesuits, the Lyceum Library was formed from the remains of the Jesuit Library as well as several monastery libraries.\n\n\n== Science ==\nThe first society of the leading scientists and public workers in Carniola was the Dismas Fraternity (Latin: Societas Unitorum), formed in Ljubljana in 1688. In 1693, the Academia Operosorum Labacensium was founded and lasted with an interruption until the end of the 18th century. The next academy in Ljubljana, the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, was not established until 1938.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nLjubljana Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik Airport (IATA code LJU), located 26 kilometers (16 mi) northwest of the city, has flights to numerous European destinations. Among the companies that fly from there are Air France, Air Serbia, Brussels Airlines, easyJet, Finnair, Lufthansa, Montenegro Airlines, Swiss, Wizz Air, Transavia and Turkish Airlines. The destinations are mainly European. This airport has superseded the original Ljubljana airport, in operation from 1933 until 1963. It was located in the Municipality of Polje (nowadays the Moste District), on a plain between Ljubljanica and Sava next to the railroad in Moste. There was a military airport in \u0160i\u0161ka from 1918 until 1929.\n\n\n=== Rail transport ===\nIn the Ljubljana Rail Hub, the Pan-European railway corridors V (the fastest link between the North Adriatic, and Central and Eastern Europe) and X (linking Central Europe with the Balkans) and the main European lines (E 65, E 69, E 70) intersect. All international transit trains in Slovenia drive through the Ljubljana hub, and all international passenger trains stop there. The area of Ljubljana has six passenger stations and nine stops. For passengers, the Slovenian Railways company offers the possibility to buy a daily or monthly city pass that can be used to travel between them. The Ljubljana railway station is the central station of the hub.  The Ljubljana Moste Railway Station is the largest Slovenian railway dispatch. The Ljubljana Zalog Railway Station is the central Slovenian rail yard. There are a number of industrial rails in Ljubljana. At the end of 2006, the Ljubljana Castle funicular started to operate. The rail goes from Krek Square (Krekov trg) near the Ljubljana Central Market to Ljubljana Castle. It is especially popular among tourists. The full trip lasts 60 s.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nLjubljana is located where Slovenia's two main freeways intersect, connecting the freeway route from east to west, in line with Pan-European Corridor V, and the freeway in the north\u2013south direction, in line with Pan-European Corridor X. The city is linked to the southwest by A1-E70 to the Italian cities of Trieste and Venice and the Croatian port of Rijeka. To the north, A1-E57 leads to Maribor, Graz and Vienna. To the east, A2-E70 links it with the Croatian capital Zagreb, from where one can go to Hungary or important cities of the former Yugoslavia, such as Belgrade. To the northwest, A2-E61 goes to the Austrian towns of Klagenfurt and Salzburg, making it an important entry point for northern European tourists. A toll sticker system has been in use on the Ljubljana Ring Road since 1 July 2008. The centre of the city is more difficult to access especially in the peak hours due to long arteries with traffic lights and a large number of daily commuters. The core city centre has been closed for motor traffic since September 2007 (except for residents with permissions), creating a pedestrian zone around Pre\u0161eren Square.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe historical Ljubljana tram system was completed in 1901 and was replaced by buses in 1928, which were in turn abolished and replaced by trams in 1931 in its final length of 18.5 kilometers (11.5 mi) in 1940, In 1959, it was abolished in favor of automobiles; the tracks were dismantled and tram cars were transferred to Osijek and Subotica. Reintroduction of an actual tram system to Ljubljana has been proposed repeatedly in the 2000s.There are numerous taxi companies in the city.\n\nThe Ljubljana Bus Station, the Ljubljana central bus hub, is located next to the Ljubljana railway station. The city bus network, run by the Ljubljana Passenger Transport (LPP) company, is Ljubljana's most widely used means of public transport. The fleet is relatively modern. The number of dedicated bus lanes is limited, which can cause problems in peak hours when traffic becomes congested. Bus rides may be paid with the Urbana payment card (also used for the funicular) or with a mobile phone. Sometimes the buses are called trole (referring to trolley poles), harking back to the 1951\u201371 days when Ljubljana had trolleybus (trolejbus) service. There were five trolleybus lines in Ljubljana, until 1958 alongside the tram.Another means of public road transport in the city centre is the Cavalier (Kavalir), an electric vehicle operated by LPP since May 2009. There are three such vehicles in Ljubljana. The ride is free and there are no stations because it can be stopped anywhere. It can carry up to five passengers; most of them are elderly people and tourists. The Cavalier drives in the car-free zone in the Ljubljana downtown. The first line links \u010cop Street, Wolf Street and the Hribar Embankment, whereas the second links Town Square, Upper Square, and Old Square. There is also a tractor with wagons decorated to look like a train for tourists in Ljubljana, linking Cyril and Methodius Square in the city centre with Ljubljana Castle.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\n\nThere is a considerable amount of bicycle traffic in Ljubljana, especially in the warmer months of the year. It is also possible to rent a bike. Since May 2011, the BicikeLJ, a self-service bicycle rental system offers the residents and visitors of Ljubljana 600 bicycles and more than 600 parking spots at 60 stations in the wider city centre area. The daily number of rentals is around 2,500. There was a possibility to rent a bike even before the establishment of BicikeLJ.There are still some conditions for cyclists in Ljubljana that have been criticised, including cycle lanes in poor condition and constructed in a way that motorised traffic is privileged. There are also many one-way streets which therefore cannot be used as alternate routes so it is difficult to legally travel by bicycle through the city centre. Through years, some prohibitions have been partially abolished by marking cycle lanes on the pavement. Nevertheless, the situation has been steadily improving; in 2015, Ljubljana placed 13th in a ranking of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities. In 2016, Ljubljana was 8th on the Copenhagenize list.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nThe river transport on the Ljubljanica and the Sava was the main means of cargo transport to and from the city until the mid-19th century, when railroads were built. Today, the Ljubljanica is used by a number of tourist ships, with wharves under the Butchers' Bridge, at Fish Square, at Court Square, at Breg, at the Poljane Embankment, and elsewhere.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\nLjubljana has a rich history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology. The majority of secondary and tertiary care in Slovenia takes place in Ljubljana. The Ljubljana University Medical Centre is the largest hospital centre in Slovenia. The Faculty of Medicine (University of Ljubljana) and the Ljubljana Institute of Oncology are other two central medical institutions in Slovenia. The Ljubljana Community Health Centre is the largest health centre in Slovenia. It has seven units at 11 locations. Since 1986, Ljubljana is part of the WHO European Healthy Cities Network.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLjubljana is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of people from Ljubljana\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nJarrett, Mark (2013).

          "Must see! If you purchase the ticket to walk around the old towns walls it includes the access into this as well which we would have never known if we Haden\u2019s looked at the fine print. For the 30 euros you can do both. Highly recommend!",
          "This is a good example of what Dubrovnik is partially about. History, old forts, conjured feelings of a medieval time where knights, royalty and peasants alike lived in this area and defended it from intruders - and there were many - to protect their way of life. (sound",

          "This place is a little hard to find and there's a lot of stairs to get there, but once you're in, it's an unknown corner of Dubrovnik in a city where there's tourists everywhere. The foundry part was mildly interesting, but the best part was the walk down the outside of the wall",
          "The entrance is hidden, and old signs are left to deter people in the wrong direction. The guard was watching TV in the museum so loud it echoed through the place. I thought he stopped when we arrived but he just went outside to smoke and came back blasting his TV show. We",

          "The lady at the entrance ticket office can be a bit grumpy. I guess that is because even with half a dozen of signs outside, inside and even on the ticket desk probably 9/10 tourists ask if this is the entry to the city walls tour and the upper part of the Min\u010deta tower. No it's",

          "I think it would have been a better experience if Divo had taken the tour instead of the iPad I was given. We Found it a very static exhibit. At times just staring at a graphic exhibit ( picture) while listening to a voice on the iPad. The coolness under the ground a welcome",
          "We probably wouldn\u2019t have found this fantastic museum without a little help from this site, but We found it at it was worth the climb. We got an audioguide on a tablet and it told the story about this early industrial zone and the defense of the City quite Well.",
          "An absolute must if you\u2019re in Dubrovnik. Doesn\u2019t take too long (we took around an hour), is super cheap (30 Kuna/around \u00a35-\u00a36 I think) and is really really interesting. Very well put together museum. Would definitely recommend!",

          "Once you have walked the walls and toured the city, you should definitely plan on visiting the Gornji Ugao Tower. It was fascinating and so well presented. We used the tablet version of the tour which was great - very informative but not overly verbose. The site has been so",
          "If you have time on your hands then I would recommend you to come & visit this place. It is a bit hidden and a bit tucked away but it worth visiting this place. It's not a big place & it's inside but had good air conditioning so you can come & visit no matter the weather. We",

          "As others have mentioned, the lone guide/curator/ticket seller is a mine of interesting information. This old foundry, which lay undiscovered for more than 400 years until its excavation this century, is beautifully laid out and enthusiastically displayed. It deserves more",
          "Like previous reviewer we were surprised how quiet and restful this place is amongst the hustle and bustle of Dubrovnik. Do not be put off if no one is there to greet you as tthere is only one guy looking after the place. The initial impression is that you may be in for a dull",
          "A small exhibition of an ancient foundry from Old Dubrovnik situated underneath the Minceta tower. You have to walk up a few (ok 160+) steps to get to it and the entrance is out of the way in the corner of a modern playground/basketball court! You will be shown around by Divo",
          "We had a hard time finding this place, so luckily there were some construction workers nearby who showed us the way. Go through the basketball court and down the stairs! The best part about this attraction is Divo. No one really knows about this place right now, so he has the",
          "We were really surprised many people don't make it this place given the rave reviews. Well we made it up the steps and it was well worth it, worthy of those reviews. The guide was excellent and as there was only two of use, our private tour was very interactive, informative and",

          "Such an interesting tour of this medieval corner of old Dubrovnik, hidden underneath the playground & soon to be connected to the walls walk...the builders were working away while we were there. Divo is a very knowledgeable guide & the museum displays are easy to understand",
          "We were a group of 4 international people and the guide was super nice, he gave us a private tour with really interesting informations that were not displayed on panels. The place is interesting, maybe not really accessible without guide and not well advertised.",
          "What everyone else said. Fascinating museum, great tour guide, inexpensive and not difficult to get around. Givo needs assistance though! It is his wealth of knowledge and wonderful personality that really make this museum shine. It would be too bad to lose that.",
          "Quickly no longer a secret and for good reason. Our family enjoyed this, including or 10-year old son who was interested in the foundry's history. Divo was very knowledgeable and gave a great tour.",
          "If you can find this museum, it is well worth the effort. We were the only guests that Givo had so far that day. The museum has been created in the excavation of a foundry that functioned until the earthquake of 1667. Givo gave us a personalized and in-depth tour of the site. To",
          "I have been to Dubrovnik 4 times in the last five years and never knew this place was here. I heard about it and had to check it out on here. My partner and I really enjoyed our visit. Divo the guide was amazing. Really nice guy and really passionate about his job. It was just",
          "You must visit here- the guide is a fantastic guy and really passionate- the place is very interesting and gives you a good feel for the city of many centuries ago- look for it when you're on the walls at Minceta tower- the corner of the basketball court- you'll have to leave",
          "Very interesting \"in-citu\" museum of an ancient foundry in Dubrovnik. It's a real hidden gem of the City Walls and after a long walk through the walls you'll suddenly find this small place of beautiful view and amazing story behind it..This is the place where cannons, cannon",
          "Having been tipped off by reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to track down the archeological site of Gornji Ugao Tower, under the basket ball pitch near to the wall between Fort Minceta and Pile gate. Go through Pile gate into the old town and go left very soon after the",
          "Go find this museum under the basketball court! The best thing we saw in Dubrovnik, nicely off the tourist trail (possibly not for long after these rave reviews) and all brought to life by the fantastic Divo, who deserves to be paid as much as the CEO of the Dubrovnik tourist",
          "Off the beaten track and you won't find it in any guide book but a visit to the old foundry under Dubrovnik's city walls is well worth a visit - and the effort of climbing the 160 steps from the Benedictine Monastery. The visit was made extra special by the brilliant and",
          "This is a small archaeological site which is signposted but nevertheless quite difficult to find. Keep going up the hill until you reach the basketball court which you cross and then descend a small set of stairs. I understand soon the entrance will be from the top of the tower",
          "Though hard to find due to its unassuming entrance, we really enjoyed our tour of the foundry. The experience was made twice as good with \"Divo\" the tour guide, he was so friendly/funny and we almost wanted to follow him for the rest of the day!! He has a vast amount of",
          "We found this place thanks to Tripadvisor. It is difficult to find, but worth the effort of looking. We were the first visitors of the season. IT IS NOW OPEN! DIvo, the guide, is a mine of information and so enthusiastic. The place is a museum showing the architectural remains",
          "We found out about this place from TripAdvisor. It took a little while for us to find it because it was located in the top left corner of the town, underneath the basketball court. You have to enter into the court, and then walk all the way to the opposite corner and go down the",
          "A very interesting - and very hard to find - museum. This was the site of a medieval foundry, well-preserved and well-excavated. The museum is very new and nicely set up. Sadly (but lucky for me) there are so few visitors that the lone employee was able to lock up the ticket",

          "Visited the museum after reading about this on trip adviser. We was walking around the walls when we saw the guide wandering around below us on the basket ball court. We asked how we got into the museum and he explained you had to leave the walls and enter via the street at the",
          "The museum is a bit hidden in the residential area of the old town, but worth the effort! The site was only found in 2005 so it gives a fresh view on the historical Dubrovnik. Since not so many travellers find their ways here, you'll get a private tour around the exhibition from",
          "This was a real gem after watching numerous episodes of BBC's Time Team archeology series. Our guide (Divo?) gave us full Time Team like immersion to the history of the dig, the Foundry and its significance for the city. He was enthusiastic and very friendly, if BBC continues",
          "We found this museum from pictures on trip advisor as its not sign posted anywhere. We were greeted by our guide who seemed surprised to see us thinking we wanted tickets for the city wall walk. He gave us a really informative tour of the foundry which was only discovered in",
          "We followed the directions of a TA reviewer (thanks) and found it first time. There we were given a guided tour by a young man called Divo, his tour was very informative and entertaining, it is one of those attractions that you can easily miss but once you have been you are so",
          "My daughter had researched before we came and we were not disappointed in this marvelous place which was fascinating and well worth the small entrance fee",
          "Despite a lot of great reviews, this is still a pleasant and peaceful corner. Get there before everyone does! A surreal approach across the basketball court with an eagle's eye view of the old town below. Head for the unobtrusive door in the corner and enter the Middle Ages,",
          "Seeing this on TripAdvisor, it seemed like the perfect place to find. It is hidden but well worth it. Since we both have bad knees, we approached from the cable car entrance of the city. Go through this gate, first right and keep going, up a few stairs until you reach a gate",
          "We visited in May and only found this place by chance when we googled 'must do things in Dubrovnik' - needless to say that we were very pleased that we found it. The guide was the highlight because he was and hopefully still is passionate about the tower. I do so hope it",
          "Access this site by climbing the first long staircase on the left after entering the city at the western wall (by the cathedral). If you see a big tree partway up the stairs, you found the right staircase. The site is under the tallest tower at the NW corner of the old city",
          "Hard to find. But as you leave the cable car turn left down the hill, cross the road at the crossing, go via foot path under the road, turn right immediately after you enter the old town, you very quickly find the basketball court. Go across the court on the right down some",
          "Great museum hidden away beneath the Minceta Tower. The entrance is via the basketball court. The tour guide is really informative and actually runs the whole operation. Great value for money, very interesting and a great place to cool down ( or stay dry!) . Well worth a visit.",
          "I went on this tour after finding it on TripAdvisor. My wife and I enjoyed it. It's a very low key, off the beaten path, tour. It's nice to get away from the crowds. They did a very nice job excavating and building an exhibit around the foundry. The guide was knowledgeable and",
          "A very interesting little exhibition on a surprisingly well preserved slice of history. It is presented by well spoken and informed guide who offers additional infos. The door is a bit hidden at the back of the basketball court, but it is worth seeking out.",
          "This museum is as everyone says -uncrowded, interesting, and a great tour guide. He explained it all and is knowledgeable and clearly proud of the place. But not many people can find it. The key is to follow the first road inside the gate (either pile gate or the one near the",
          "I was looking for one last thing to do on our last morning in Dubrovnik and found this museum on tripadvisor. So we went to the basketball court near Min\u010deta Tower. To get to the court, best enter the Old Town at Bu\u017ea gate, turn right and then walk alongside the wall. That way",

          "Great to see some of the early history relating to Dubrovnik at the time of the great earthquake. Not sure why on spending so much money the city keeps this so well hidden, thank you to previous reviews for directions or we never would have found it in the corner of the",
          "Enthusiastic docent, interesting tour, worth seeking out for quick 20-30 min time investment. Take street on south side of monetary and head up alley and steps until you see basketball court; entrance is down steps on corner of court.",
          "Hidden under a basketball court, this place somehow attracts lost tourists looking for a way into the city walls. If you go in to actually see the dig, the guide will reward you with a very interesting tour of the inside.",

          "It took two attempts to find this wonderful museum, but when we got there, it lived up to all its great reviews. (Better signage outside the basketball court would greatly help, as more people should experience this gem). Divot is determined to make everyone's visit informative",
          "This site is highly recommended if you are interested in learning more about the history of the city. The tower is actually an underground archaeological site that was discovered very recently in the mid-late 2000's. The focus is entirely on the city's medieval foundry that was",

          "Our first stop in Dubrovnik was to visit this and we weren't disappointed - Divot gave us an a engaging funny personal tour and made the excavation come to life - really fascinating!",
          "This is actually an archaeological site within the city walls of Old Dubrovnik. After the earthquake in 1662 they didn't bother to reconstruct this part and left the rubble and built around it. Under the rubble are the remains of the 15th century foundry where they cast bells,",

          "Me and my boyfriend stumbled into this museum/archaeological site trying to find a good view of Dubrovnik. The curator \u0110ivo was extremly friendly and knowledgeable and he told us everything about this medieval cannon factory and many other things in Dubrovnik. Thank you \u0110ivo,",
          "Decided to seek this place out after the many good reviews. Bumped into Divot cleaning the bins outside before realising he was in fact, the ticket person, tour guide and face of the whole museum! He was very knowledgable about the excavations (I had no idea they were so",
          "Should you manage to find the Museum under the city walls, you will be treated to a unique tour of the Cities' Ancient Foundry archeological site. Only 30 Kuna to enter, but the real treat is the tour guide, Divot. Divot is meant to o my take money for tickets, but he goes",

          "The foundry lay buried from 1667 until two programmes of excavation this century have revealed what is today a wonderful exhibition. One does not need to have an interest in archaeology to find the tour with Divo a real pleasure. The layout of the museum makes the tour",
          "The museum is hidden behind a basketball court. When we entered, we had to wait some short time for the guide, as he was with another group. We are definitely not a history geeks, but this guy made a wonderful job. He teoretically works as cashier, but in he does a perfect",

          "We found the basketball court exploring one day and then read on TripAdvisor the reviews of the museum below. It's pretty easy to find, take the first left after main gate to go up a number of stairs to corner of the fort, you'll see a basketball court and it's the green door in",
          "Great little tour for 30 kuno exploring an excavated foundry. Enjoyable tour guide and not busy. Hunt this place down!",
          "Tucked away little area but worth finding it, we found it accidentally and very happy we did. very informative and fun tour guide",
          "A hidden gem which we found fairly easily thanks to good directions provided by previous reviewers - although be prepared to climb many steps if you want to visit. Even on a very busy day in Dubrovnik it was relatively quiet - Divo, the irrepressible guide, says 99% of visitors",
          "That was a great little secret , the young fellow we had was amazed how we found it, I told him trip advisor, he said the day before they only had 6 people visit the whole day , our group was 12 people ( biggest group ever he said ) I would highly recommend this tour to",

          "As hard to find as everyone says, but worth the effort. It's a recently excavated area of the city. The museum is just under the walls near a playground/basketball court area. Look at the pictures and read the directions people have provided or you'll never find it. You climb a",

          "Divo is a little gem ! Please go And do his tour , it is so interesting and he is so passionate about this site. It is hard to find and it needs signposts to find him , but if you find the playground by the minceta tower , he is in a little door in the far corner . Very cheap",
          "Divo is dry and witty, speaks excellent English, and covered all the detail of this medieval site comprehensively. The playground above, seen from the walls by the Mincete tower, hides the old foundry dating from 1372. There are crucibles, cannon ball moulds, volcanic casting",

          "Divo was a brilliant tour guide and spoke in depth of the incredible ruins that were recently excavated. This probably gets overlooked by many as it is not advertised on the streets and is hidden away at the back of the basketball court; however, this is a must see whilst in",
          "The guide here is a legend. He looks like Arda Turan and spends most of his day telling people this place isn't the entrance to the walls. When real visitors come he's very pleased to show them his museum, which gives interesting insights into the history of Dubrovnik",
          "We saw the sports courts from the walls but had no idea there was an archaeological site just below. Be sure to let the guide know you are looking for the museum and not just another tourist looking for a way up to the walls. Although the tour focuses on the history of this",
          "I arrived around 10am and was greeted by Divo, the ticket seller and self appointed tour guide, who after confirming I was there for the foundry, began with the tour. Divo studied archaeology and his knowledge and enthusiasm really added to the tour. I had several questions",

          "This place is a little bit off the beaten track and is difficult to find unless you know what you are looking for. This does gove the advantage if not drawing too many tourists so we got a private tour around with a very knowledgable and fun guide. Very worth a visit!",
          "Very interesting museum, dating back 100s of years. Great guide Jive, but he was stressed as very busy since it was a rainy day and lots were visiting his museum. Very difficult to find, but worth it. A real treasure.",

          "This place is not marked on city map as a museum. I found it by luck. Awesome tour from Jivo. He told everything about every stone in that medieval foundry. How it worked, why this way was all organized and not another. Why there is playground over dig site and what was mystery",
          "Dubrovnik is a beautiful city to take pictures, however already quite crowded. But I urge you, if you like to visit something \"off the road of tourism\", you absolutely must go beneath the surface and experience this authentic foundry of the middle age. The museum is run by Divo",

          "Whilst checking onlinethings to do in Dubrovnik, we saw this museum advertised. Divo (the Guide) was very informative and as other visitors have mentioned, very passionate. Only wish more people would visit. Would definitely recommend.",
          "After walking the old walls of Dubrovnik, visit this underground foundry excavation & exhibit. Look at the photos on trip advisor to find it. It is off the beaten path and across a basketball court. Reasons to go: - fascinating history on metal casting - archeologist (\u0110ivo)",
          "Lucky to have Divo free to guide us round. Interesting museum but what makes it special is Divo, a really passionate and interesting guy with good sense of humour. Thanks for sharing this secret of Dubrovnik with us, suspect it will not remain so for much longer.",
          "This is a small but excellent museum showing the metallurgic foundry built in 15th century. You get to see the remains of the actual foundry as well as some findings found during the excavation. Divo, responsible for selling tickets, has taken on the roll as a museum guide and",
          "This place is not that easy to find but if you walk the walls you will see the basketball court by the Minceta Tower and this will help you get your bearings. To get there either go in the Pile gate and take the first left once you are in the Stradun (Ul Celestina Medovica) Walk",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the foundry, Divo gave us a very informative tour and it was one of the highlights of our trip, it's a shame more people don't find the foundry as it's not advertised at all.",
          "Finding the place was the hardest part. It was rainy outside and when we entered inside the museum, our adventures started! We met Divo who showed us around and made the whole experience very personalized to our background and culture. The visit was extremely interesting and it",
          "Gornji Ugao was a real surprise on our trip. Although difficult to find, as similar reviews explain (go across the playground under the Minceta fortress), the foundry is interesting to learn about (reminded me a bit of the sort of thing you would get at the Bignor Roman villa).",
          "We found this tour thanks to tripadvisor. As it is mentioned, it is horribly indicated. But once you find the entrance at the basketball court, Divo gives you an interactive tour where you get a good insight of the medieval evolution of the city. You also get an insight in how",
          "We didn't actually know this museum existed, but I'm so glad we came across it whilst exploring the Old Town. Divo - my favourite person in all of Dubrovnik - invited us in for a tour, which really brought the history of the site to life. This small, hidden archaeological site",
          "What a lovely and interesting little museum this is. The museum houses the excavation and some of the findings from the old foundry that was once on the site. We had a great tour from Divo who really brought it alive for us. The museum is quite hard to find but basically you",
          "There are quite a few museums in and around Dubrovnik however on my opinion this was the best one we visited. It can be a little hard to find as its tucked away in the top corner of the Old Town under the historic city walls, but it's definitely worth finding. The museum is very",
          "This visit was recommended to us by someone staying at our hotel so we decided to seek it out and weren't disappointed. It really isn't that difficult to find, follow directions from the Main Street, climb a number of steps and look for the door in the bottom corner of the",
          "Divo is a fountain of knowledge about the foundry museum that he mans. The museum is located under the basketball court which is located at the very top walk way before you hit the wall. As you go in the front gate of the walled town, stay to your left on the main walk way, go",
          "We entered and found a very modern and clean museum, and when we went to buy tickets, were offered a personal tour by Divo. The museum was very cool and Divo was a wealth of information. We could tell throughout the tour that he is a knowledgeable and charismatic person. We",
          "Really interesting tour brought to life by the excellent curator, Divo. Despite not being medieval history buffs, he held our attention throughout the visit. You access it by going down the steps on the far side of the basketball court, in the far corner of the old city, just",
          "The tour with Divo really made our visit to this museum. Without him offering this tour we wouldn't have learned nearly as much or enjoyed ourselves as much. Divo provided a very interesting view of the museum and background on the discovery/archeology of the site. And for only",
          "Dubrovnik is an amazing city with a fascinating history. It's sad to see reminders of the recent war inside and out of the city walls, but there is also another world of history within the walls. We came across Gornji Ugao Tower after reading excellent reviews on Trip Advisor.",
          "It's underneath the tower that looks like a chess piece. Divo took us round the museum and he made it fascinating. He is obviously very knowledgeable and his enthusiasm makes it a very interesting experience. A visit not to be missed!",
          "A little awkward to locate due to the lack of signs, but certainly worth it. Once you find the basketball court, just walk across and go down the stairs. There you will find Divo, who is a true asset to the museum. He is really knowledgeable and passionate, having studied",
          "A small sight that packs a big punch: we heard more about the history of Dubrovnik during the time we spent here than the rest of our stay. Finding the stairs (at the back corner of the court) made it a fun experience to start, a well laid out exhibition of a medieval foundry",
          "This place is an absolute gem. We found out about this place on here so made sure we made it there. We did the city walls the day before and saw the basketball court where the museum is located. (Underneath). The next day we found our way up too the basketball court, it's a",
          "So as people have said, this is literally under a red-topped basketball court and you have to search for it a little. You go into this little doorway and there's the entrance. The guide - Divo? - is enthusiastic, I go as far as to say passionate, about this little museum and",
          "Walking under the inside upper side of walls of old town Dubrovnik I took a left turn to the steps going down to the old town, just under the Minceta fortress. Suddenly my ear caught a noise of children\u2019s voices coming from the small entrance in the wall that I didn\u2019t notice",
          "We checked the tourist map for the Gornji Ugao Tower and found the general location easily. The tourist leaflet calls the tower the 'Forgery' which is a mistranslation of the Foundry. When you find the signpost to the tower ignore the green door to its left and go further left",
          "What was a wonderful archaeological discovery less than 10 years ago is now a quaint little underground museum that will take you 30-45mins to go around. The Earthquake of Dubrovnik in the 17th Century buried this site, and it still remains underground, which is part of the",
          "You cannot find it - unless you are lucky to meet Divo, the young man who is responsible for the museum, sitting on the stairs outside a sports ground near the city wall of Dubrovnik. We were acutally looking for an entrance to the wall when Divo spoke to us and offered to show",
          "What a great find! Not well signed but came across the entrance while doing the city walls. Divo the ticket seller gave us a guided tour, what a wealth of knowledge he is! He went into great detail all about the history of the site and gave us much more than we would have gotten",
          "We visited the old foundry this morning at 11.00 am. Diva was so knowledgable and it was so interesting. Thank you Trip Adviser for your recommendations. It was well worth a visit. We were Diva's first customers of the day and he made us very welcome. Highly recommended!",
          "As we were looking for things to see and do in the short time we were visiting Dubrovnik we checked TripAdvisor and read about this gem. When we got to the town we set about trying to find it - we checked with at least 3 tourist attraction guides and not one knew about it!!!!",
          "This museum contains the remains of the old foundry and some of the things they manufactured like cannonballs and the equipment needed to make them. The price is excellent compared to most of the other attractions in Dubrovnik, only 30 kuna. The museum is tucked away in a quiet",
          "Not entirely sure how my friend found out about the museum but so glad she did. Divo is the caretaker and tour guide and his passion is infectious. He is incredibly knowledgeable and by the end of the tour you will be well and truly educated about the archaeology and history",
          "From the tower during the city wall walk, you can see a sport court below with kids playing sports or running around. But, underneath it, there is an archeological site of an old foundry! \u0110ivo manages museum ticketing and offers excellent tours inside. It's a very well-preserved",
          "We bumped into Givo who is the caretaker of the museum outside and he took us through the basketball court and through to the museum. He kindly gave us a tour of the foundry and the history of it. I'm not quite sure i would've been able to make much of the foundry without Givo",
          "I was kind of getting lost deliberately in the old town alongside the city wall. Then met Divo who is a guide in that museum. He was very kind and funny. While talking with him a bit, a danish couple came to visit the museum and I joined. It was a wonderful experience not only",
          "We were a little bit rushed in Dubrovnik but did end up stopping by the foundry ruins. It's a cool part of the city's history and the doorman / historian, Divo, is very much engaged and wants to show you around. It's an exciting piece of history but would be quite hard to",
          "Foundry is hard to find but worth looking for. Its next to the Gornji Ugao Tower with entrance off the adjacent ball court. Divo Sjekavica is the caretaker. He is an historian and can really fill you in on the foundry as well as Dubrovnik in genral.",
          "Well worth visiting if you have an interest in Dubrovnik's history and/or an interest in metallurgy. Divo is passionate about the foundry and the history of this corner of Dubrovnik and the city walls. He makes the site really come alive. Also good to get away from being",
          "We only knew about the existence of this place because we saw it on Trip Advisor! The reviews were right; the ancient foundry and museum were fascinating and the guide was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. More people should visit this gem of an historic site. If you",
          "This attraction is hard to find and the lack of signposting and advertising contributes to that, but it\u2019s well worth the search, so check the location on tripadvisor first and don\u2019t forget to look left for the opening to a basketball court as you walk up the stairs. The only",
          "Incredible attraction in Dubrovnik! We were walking looking for hidden places in Dubrovnik and, suddenly, we found a basketball court, something strange inside a old town. There we found Divo, a nice and friendly boy who we was talking and he offered us to see a hidden foundry",
          "My friend and I stumbled on this site by chance - it turns out to be a fascinating archaeological excavation of a 16th century foundry. Divo, who showed us around, explained its construction and workings in detail, allowing us to understand not just the foundry but the broader",
          "I'd echo previous reviewers comments. This is a fascinating excavation site with a terrific guide in Divo. At 30 kuna it's a good value. What you get is a guided tour around the remains of a 500 year old foundry which was a major business in the city providing items ranging from",
          "This easy to miss museum/archeological site is literally just a door in the city walls at a playground at the highest corner of the old city. But inside is a nice exhibition made great by the enthusiastic guide. If you have an hour and need to get inside for a bit, this is",
          "We visited this museum and it was one of the best things we saw in Dubrovnik. It is only small but very interesting. The guide Divo was excellent and a wealth of knowledge. His English is perfect and he can answer any question. It is a fascinating site that has been discovered",
          "I didn\u00b4t searched for this unexpected and magical place in the underground of Dubrovnik but am still soo happy that I found it! I was walking along Dubrovniks wall but not on the wall but just under the wall and searched for some scenes for postcards and looked into a small",
          "As many will tell you, Divo is a fabulous guide who helps you uncover the foundry hidden within the walls of Dubrovnik. Not sure why the Dubrovnik tourist board want to keep this such a secret, but I stumbled on it by accident under the basketball court. However, once you have",
          "Difficult to find but pleased we made the effort. We had a great tour from our extremely helpful guide. Great for history and archaeology buffs.",
          "Make no mistake, this is a hidden attraction. Up a long staircase and across a basketball court is a nondescript doorway into the museum. Only the small brown sign clued us that we were on the right track. This is the excavated remains of a medieval foundry which has been",
          "Interesting and tastefully designed museum which wouldn't be as interesting without the expert knowledge of Divo. He's enthusiastic and really does make the visit worthwhile, he also has great ideas on how to make the place more successful if the powers be would allow it. We",
          "We lucked into finding this museum by spotting a small sign pointing out it's location. Luckily I'd read Tripadvisor reviews that helped direct us across a basketball court to the entrance. This is a medieval foundry site that has been excavated, enclosed and turned into a",
          "We visited this place having read reviews on Tripadvisor and we were very pleased indeed with our visit. It is quite difficult to find due to its location but managed to get to it on one rainy day during our trip to Dubrovnik. The museum and the tower has been brought to life by",
          "I read about this place on tripadvisor and since we love looking at ruins and archeology sights.We made the 187 stair climb.It was very hard to find.It is a little door beside the basket ball court.Divo gave us a great tour showing us around.We were very glad we came.First time",
          "Quite hard to find but best museum we visited, was very cheap to get in and was given a personal tour by Divo who had excellent knowledge of the foundry. Also had a good laugh and learnt a lot!",
          "we went here based on trip advisor reviews and it was an excellent discovery. Hard to find but basically you enter through the pile gate, turn left and keep going up the stairs till you come to the basketball court, you then go across the court and down a small flight of stairs.",
          "There's a sign on the place guide on the first Street on the left off the Stradum from Pile Gate that says 16th century foundry. Walk the 100 steps or so to the top, till you come to a basketball court on the left. At the far corner is a door that leads you in. There is no sign,",
          "All the previous reviews about Divo's enthusiasm for his museum are true. He is very knowledgeable about the medieval foundry discovered fairly recently within the old town . But you'll need to be quick if you want to visit as its closing at the end of the month and",
          "Following the nice reviews from others, we maneuvered our way to the Gornji Ugau Tower and its restored medieval foundry. Divo was absolutely one of the best informed, friendliest, and most communicative guides you could ever hope to find. It's not quite as hard to find as some",
          "This is a separate archealogical exhibition of the original site for metal casting. You can find it by walking to the top of the first set of stairs on the left after entering the old town from pile gate (go past the pharmacy museum entrance, signage directs you towards 16th",

          "I'm generally not one to write reviews, but I had to make an exception because this little museum (and Divo) deserve it. The site itself is interesting, but it is Divo who really brings it to life. He is full of information pertaining to the foundry and the city in the time the",
          "I was traveling alone in Dubrovnik last May and promised I would write this review for Divo after having such a fantastic time and getting a one-on-one tour with him! Visiting the foundry you'll feel like you are seeing a secret area of the city and really glimpsing a piece of",
          "Was with two other friends and we went to find this museum. Had a little bit of a run around to find it though. Sign posting is not great. Look for the basketball court and it's right at the back. Was fascinating. Such a shame that we arrived there late. The guy touring was very",
          "This museum is quite hard to find if you don't know where you're going, but it's well worth the effort - when you arrive in old town turn left up the first street you come to, up all the steps and then across a basket ball court. It was a pleasure to meet and chat with Divo this",
          "Divo walked us through the museum personally, explaining how the process worked and helping us understand what we were seeing. He was very knowledgeable and answered our many questions thoroughly. Highly recommended.",
          "Like everyone else, we didn't hear about this fantastic site through a guide book. We saw a picture at a ticket office and the place is apparently so obscure, we even bought the wrong tickets! With 20 minutes left in the day it was one hell of an effort to locate (including",
          "I wasn't looking for this museum, but rather stumbled upon it after also finding what must be one of the most dramatically situated basketball parks in the world. Fewer tourists bother to make steep the hike up to this corner of the town so you will be rewarded with a more",
          "The guide is great, the museum is fascinating and one of a kind. You should visit it if you like are interested in metallurgy and history. You can see there for example how a chuch bell was made 500 years ago.",
          "We sought out this museum after reading about Divo on TA. He is truly passionate about his museum and personally guides you through it so you understand all that is there. He makes it interesting and you learn so much more than you could by going though on your own. It's a shame",
          "Tucked away in a corner of the old city, most people would normally give this a miss especially given the lack of clear signs and the number of stairs you have to climb to reach it. We went to the place based on reviews and were amazed. The history and the archaeological",
          "Wow what a hidden gem. Perfectly preserved 16th century foundry. It's worth hunting this down. Right at the top left corner of Dubrovnik old town. You really do have to walk across the baseball courts and if you are lucky Divo will give you a tour. He is so passionate about his",
          "A great intimate tour of this archeological site. We (just 4 people) were shown around by Divo, a fantastic guide whose passion for history and archeology was obvious. Highly recommend this attraction.",

          "This museum was incredible and brought to life by \u0110ivo who was our fantastc, enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. We all found the stories about the old foundry (metal smelting factory) very interesting and it was helpful to see the metal casts of the cannon balls, pellets",

          "This place is hardly mentioned in the guide books, as it is a very recent find (2008), and it only opened to the public in 2013. I visited it based on the Tripadvisor reviews, and I'm very glad I did. On the official, free Drubrovnik tourist map wchih you can get at the tourist",

          "So unexpected! We were walking along the walls when we saw the entrance of the foundry. Divo asked if we wanted tickets and just walked down and gave us a private tour! We were so grateful to have Divo explained how, where, and when the foundry happened. We would have never been",
          "Stumbled upon this place by coincident. Started talking to Divo, who turned out to be a guide at a archeological museum beneath the wall of the town. He had much interesting to learn us, both about the history of the town and medieval foundry techniques. Truly a hidden gem i",

          "I visited this morning and found Divo (pronounced Givo) to be as wonderful as the reviews led me to believe. Approximately 2 million USD were spent creating this wonderful museum and then it was hidden away...all the better for anyone who gets a solo tour! 30 ku gets you 3",

          "This Franciscan monastery is worth a visit after you\u2019ve prioritised the cable car/fort/museum and the ancient city walls. The building is quite interesting as are the artefacts. It can be a quiet cool place on hot day but it depends upon how busy the tourist season is when",

          "The old pharmacy was really unique to see. This is a quiet respite from the hoards of travelers clogging the Dubrovnik streets during high season. Worth a visit!",
          "It was so cool to see the old medicine bottles and textbooks! The garden is pretty and the small museum attached has very cool artifacts related to medicine and religion.",
          "I agree with most of the reviews about the Dominican monastery. It's small and quiet and can be visited in 10 mins which means there isn't much to see. However, la piece de resistance is the Tiziano's painting showing the historical links between Venetia and Dubrovnik. The",
          "Visited the Dominican Monastery today, not to be confused with the Franciscan one, which some of the other reviewers seem to have done. There is a charge of 30 kunas, not free or discounted with the Dubrovnik card. However it is worth paying the money to see some beautiful",

          "Located very near the old port, the entrance is reached up an elegant flight of steps. An interesting fact is that the monks spoiled the look of this by filling in part of the balustrade to protect ladies' ankles from view! The monastery contains a splendid cloister, similar",

          "A great place to sit and relax away from the crowds and take in the beauty of the building. There were some religious relics on display that were interesting but not much else to experience. Definitely worth seeing.",

          "Just on the left having entered the Stradun by the Pile Gate, this place offers some respite from the hustle and bustle outside. If you don't have a Dubrovnik Card there is an entrance fee to pay. The intricacies of some of the religious pieces on show are amazing, the skills",

          "The Dominicans established a monastery in the City in 1225 but this Monastery was not completed until the 14th century, located near the Ploce Gate. Further additions were made during the next 200 years and the complex was completed 1485. The bell tower was a later addition",
          "Started to build in the beginning of the 14th century and had to be rebuilt after the earthquake of 1664. Nice museum with a lot of historical artifacts.",

          "You really feel as if you\u2019ve stumbled into another time when you visit here. It\u2019s so peaceful. Cloisters are beautiful. Old pharmacy is very interesting.",
          "Came here because I had seen pictures of the courtyard and surrounding arches. It did not disappoint. The museum was also a special addition. I think the cost was 30 kuna.",
          "We know that not everybody can find entrance to this Monastery, and it is not an easy way to get there unplanned. But once you get in, you will be pleasantly shocked how calm and beautiful here. This place inspires you and brings to the atmosphere of the Games of Thrones.",
          "We really enjoyed this place - a simple but effective design that creates both light and shade to produce a harmonious environment. The frescoes are lovely, having being beautifully restored in recent times. The museum is okay but the pharmacy is interesting.",
          "Gorgeous cloistered building and museum with old pharmacy - only \u00a33 per person ( 20 kuna) - worth every penny",
          "This is a lovely place to visit and if memory serves me is featured in Game of Thrones a few time. The little garden hidden within is so lovely and a place to cool down. There is a also a little museum within with religious icons and pharmaceuticals paraphernalia. Very pretty",
          "The monastery is beautiful and quite well preserved. There's also an exhibit inside (free) which talks about the plants, wildlife, and history of the island, which was pretty interesting. They also had a bit about Game of Thrones, and a model of the throne.",
          "Interior cloister is beutiful and so peacfull.The age of the building amazes me and the history. Don't miss the pharmacy shop. A must to get there is the rose cream that the monks have been making there since1317.",
          "A beautiful setting and the conversion to museum has been done amazingly well. Some of the old exhibits are just beautiful. Really glad we went in.",

          "For 4 euros, well spent 15 minutes. There are numerous relics to view but the space is smallish and unless you listen to a tour groups tour guide, you\u2019ll move on. Old pharmacy closes early.",
          "This is an attractive place to enjoy photos and a quiet stroll. Take a little time to see the old and new pharmacies. The modern one is still dispensing products found only there, such as gold cream. (Overheard a tour guide saying this)",
          "A quiet oasis apart from the crowded streets of Dubrovnik, the monastery is definitely worth seeing! An impressive stairway leads you inside; take some time to sit in the cloister, then view the museum with gorgeous paintings and interesting golden reliquaries including one",

          "If you enter the old city by the Pile gate (as most visitors do) you walk straight down the main street (Stradun) until you reach the square at the end near the harbour. If the sun is roasting you will already be starting to sweat so you ascend the steps on your left (in the",
          "Not much to this attraction but it was enjoyable. The garden area is very nice (currently scaffolding up) and the museum offers some good insight into local history, great to escape the crowds, quick visit but worth it.",
          "Soak in the atmosphere and let your imagination (if creative) run riot. Should you be of age where you recall much of your school Latin lessons then this will greatly enhance your visit. Well worth the admission fee this is one of the real gems of Dubrovnik.",
          "Small, but very nice to see, especially the garden. Photo collage of Congo was impressive. Staff very friendly! A little on the expensive side, but so is everything in Dubrovnik.",
          "The recommendation is to buy the Dubrovnik 1 day ticket, that gives you access to several museums, including this monastery. It is very beautiful and peaceful. Here you can escape from the crowds outside and appreciate a well-conserved piece of history.",
          "A good way to spend some time in the monastery to understand more about the past. Good number of paintings and pictures on display...",
          "Small but worthwhile to see history of \"pharmacy\" and the paintings. A welcome escape from the crowds of people outside.",
          "The architecture around the monastery and cloisters is very nice. Worth a visit to the museum and old pharmacy. Small admission fee.",
          "This monastery is small but interesting. Built in the 14th century on the eastern side of old town close to the Pile gate, this place holds small exhibitions from time to time. The inner church is beautiful. One of many lovely places in the old town.",
          "It's true that this is an oasis of calm. And the current/ongoing pharmacy, as well as the museum, are interesting. But they have \"restored\" a series of frescos, and what they have done is absolutely a horror.",
          "The monastery is beautiful and its cool to see the pharmacy that's been operating for nearly 700 years. You are only allowed in the main square, so it takes about 30 minutes to visit, including the small museum.",
          "Located just inside the Pile Gate this monastery was a godsend (pardon the pun) in the middle of a scorching hot day. It was calm and uncrowded, and refreshingly cool - a perfect place to just sit and re-group whilst admiring the nice central garden. The small museum was",
          "Located just within the city walls and off the main street, this lovely monastery is an oasis of calm and cool within the city. The monastery holds an old pharmacy as well as a current pharmacy (the only one available in the old city). The inner cloister is a welcome square of",
          "This is a beautiful location of the Main Street in the Old Town. Interesting artefacts and several wonderful paintings as well as pharmacy original pots etc. It does not take long to look round but the price is very reasonable and we were not charged entry for our adult",
          "A very pretty little cloiser, but the gem is in the art. They have a small art museum with some fantastic pieces including a Titian madonna. They also have some very nice relics including a skull from St Luke (hs head), St Stephen (his head), St Dominic. Also the second room",
          "I was speechless. As a art Historian and a lover of all things Renaissance. This was a gem. Great manuscripts, great triptychs and amazing church relics. I will b back. Loved it. You can get so close. And as opposed to the national Gallery London. You haven't got someone looking",
          "We went because it was the oldest one in town. It was very small and not much on display there. We were out of there in 30 mins. It was pretty much a square courtyard and that was it. Abit disappointed.",
          "Very small monastery but a beautiful courtyard inside. We went late morning and it was not too crowded. I would imagine it would be difficult if there was a tour there at the same time. The old and current pharmacies were very interesting as well. I was also moved to see the",
          "Just dropped in and were surprised at the the historic significance and design of this site. Relaxing with some great mosaics.",
          "This was a moderately interesting place to pass the time when we ran out of things to do in Dubrovnik. Some interesting history and paintings. Church was being restored, so it was interesting to see the process, but generally it was underwhelming.",
          "There's a plethora of beautiful historical and architecturally important buildings in Dubrovnik but this struck me the most. Exquisite courtyard and attached church and site of the oldest pharmacy in Europe with tonnes of old parchments in and a missile hole from the bombing in",
          "We came on the bus to Dubrovnik from the town we stayed at in Cavtat. Went to visit the chemist thats been going for years, and still is a chemist today, bit more modern now. We walked through to out side and used to be a monastery years ago. Interesting place.",
          "This monastery is very much like other ones we have seen. The small museum has a few interesting pieces. The art gallery is interesting and very cool. This makes it a nice break from the heat.",
          "Dominican Monastery is a small museum, with a central courtyard that invited a few minutes of rest. We highly recommend a visit. Our May visit was not with crowds, and no cruise ships were present. We enjoyed pleasant spring weather. Know that Dubrovnik was destroyed during",
          "The Dominican Monastery was constructed and included within the city walls to defend the city against its enemies. It also played an important role in the cultural activities in the city. The wonderful bell tower of the monastery is a major landmark in the Old City. Today the",
          "Parts of this are under construction and the church is closed. The chapel that I peered into was quite plain. The icons and religious artifacts in the museum though were quite good and I was able to leisurely move around a couple of tour groups who were in a much bigger hurry",
          "The people at the ticket desk have no information to hand out, but we enjoyed a half hour here with an interesting small museum, lovely central courtyard where we could sit and relax, and an adjoining old pharmacy (free to visit) - with the materials on display in the museum.",
          "With several museums inside and lots of tour guides and tourists, I still recommend this place....you cant take pictures inside the area where the jewelry is but as usual, there are those tourists that disrespect the laws of the country....you know...they ones known for always",
          "Within this monastery's solid stone walls is a gorgeous mid-14th-century cloister, a historic pharmacy and a small museum with a collection of relics and liturgical objects, including chalices, paintings, gold jewellery and pharmacy items such as laboratory gear and medical",
          "Surprised to pay to visit. Also not allowed to take photos. Where the Oldest Pharmacy is siutated.(a modern one is in situ) The cloisters reminded me of Salisbury Cathedral or the Monastery in Lisbon",
          "Absolutely adore the monastery garden, a true oasis of tranquility in such an overcrowded city. Beautiful flora and architecture.",
          "If you only go to one museum in Dubrovnik, this is the one to go to. Beautiful cloister and beautifully restored altar pieces, nicely presented.",
          "Beautiful place to walk in the cool, peaceful surroundings. garden plants and water in the courtyard.",
          "Went here on May 9. Paid 30 kuna per adult. Did not tell us that the church was closed. Should have offered a discount price due to that. Walked through cloister and two rooms with paintings/artifacts. No photos.",
          "Lots of history, very peaceful and a good place to take a break from the hectic normal site seeing places.",
          "These monks supposedly started the oldest monastery in Europe. You walk past that pharmacy as you walk in the monastery. It is still in operation today! And they have an original Rubens in their museum!",
          "This is a delightful stop off from main stream Dubrovnik. Here in the cloister you have a peaceful garden where silence is honoured. There are seats to rest and pray. The museum is delightful tracing some of the history of Dubrovnik in its paintings and frescos. An hour will",
          "This place costs 30 kuna, which is inexpensive as far as Dubrovnik museums go these days. More significantly, it is free if you have the Dubrovnik Pass, so you might as well get one in my opinion. At the time of writing, the Rector's Palace is closed for renovations. Maybe this",
          "The Dominican Monastery built in the 14th century is situated close to the Ploce Gate at the east end of Dubrovnik Old Town. I did not have the time to visit the inside but was told that the museum within the Monastery exhibits many artifacts, paintings and jewelleries which",
          "visited as part of a group tour. Guide ( a former miss croatia,) was knowledgeable and spoke great english.",
          "The monastery is well kept and the museum worth a visit, as is the monastery garden. A quiet place in the old city.",
          "If you enter via the Pile Gate the Monastry is located on left hand side and is attached to a museum. Both are worth a visit, which includes one of Europes oldest pharmacies.",
          "I have visited the Dominican Monastery three times and enjoyed it every time. It's peaceful and a nice escape from activity outside the walls of the monastery. It's also a museum, with historical pieces and religious relics etc.",
          "It costs 50 kuna to get in. It's got a small but interesting pharmacy shop. Nice garden with palmtrees. Calm atmosphere. Not very much else to say. If you like to know about the history of the town you need to visit this place, if you don't care.. you might find this boring.",
          "Like the title, you wont need more than 10-15 minutes. Pretty place, but that is about it. Its kind of hidden as well. The door is close to where you enter the walls of dubrovnik.",
          "Beautiful architecture; great art; wonderful relics; humbling to see the mortars that hit this ancient city in the stupid war in the 1990s.",
          "Tucked away between Luza Square and the Ploce gate, at the top of a wide stone staircase, you will find the Dominican Monastery. For a modest admission fee you can view the peaceful cloister, several display rooms with religious artifacts and the gorgeous chapel. Despite the",
          "We enjoyed every moment of visiting this old monastery. Paintings on the walls were great and almost well preserved, the cloister was very nice under un big blue sky and lemon trees all around. The keepers were nice and the old pharmacy was nice from outside. Indeed a good visit",
          "Well worth a visit but a small amount of items in the museum to see so set expectations. What is there is very interesting.",
          "The Dominican monastery is just off Stradun. there are some beautiful artefacts and triptychs and a nice central courtyard as well as a chapel. having said that there isn't a huge amount else here.",
          "This is very close to the city walls entrance and is the first location after this on the Dubrovnic card, which was why i went in. I am glad I did as it is a little treasure of a church. The choristers are beautiful and relaxing. You won't want to be there for a long time,",
          "Tucked away just inside the Ploce Gate is the Dominican Monastery and it is a haven of peace and tranquility! For some reason, not many of the tourist parties visit this place. The entrance is up a broad flight of steps and takes you through a Gothic doorway into the Gothic",
          "Nice place, have seen similar places in Portugal. The entrance is not free. it costs 50 Kuna. nice to visit there if its not crowded inside, otherwise I would not enjoy it much personally...",
          "St. Dominic\u2019s in Dubrovnik were once part of Dubrovnik\u2019s city walls. It is a Gothic-style church and is one of the 17 churches found here. The half-round stairs solved the issue of the church being built on a hillside. The worship space was above the street level. St.",
          "The Dominican Monastery is a 700 year old building built at the time of the City Walls. It is located close to the inner Polce Gate behind the Sponza Palace and it is protected by the Fort Revelin and looks more like a fortress. The Dominican Monastery lies on the eastern side",
          "Make certain you visit if you are an art lover. There is a lovely Titian and an excellent collection from the Dubrovnik School of Art. Also, lovely examples of Dubrovnik jewelry over the ages. The church is lovely (and a working church) -- with excellent examples of",
          "You have no real idea that this is here, hidden behind the main doors. You are not allowed in the very centre of the garden, which is a shame and more could be made of such a beautiful place. Still nice to visit and there is a gift shop",
          "We loved the columns surrounding the courtyard. The reliquaries were beautiful. The fragments of the war of independence were a small part but powerful.",
          "This was tricky to find so i needed my map but its worth the visit. Tucked up some side steps close to the city walls exit, there is a nice peaceful cloister. Again lovely on a crowded hot day. The chapel is amazing and so quiet. A highlight of my visit",
          "Peaceful, small, charming and pleasant. A great little place to escape to for half an hour or so. It is one of many wonderful old buildings in the city, but this one really does deserve a visit.",
          "One of the more interesting of the many buildings you can visit with a Dubrovnik visitors card with a good range of exhibits.",
          "The Church is wonderful, the visit was made extra special by a young man who was singing and playing to a harmonium",
          "Just a quick stop here to round out our Dubrovnik Pass and discovered the beautiful gardens in the middle past the pharmacy.",
          "This is a beautiful quiet small sanctuary just off the main street - well worth finding. There is an ancient dispensary that has been open for 800 years plus (sadly closed on the day we went, as it was a public holiday).",
          "There is a great deal to see in this monastery, but for those who are interested in masterpieces, this site is a must. The first \"hidden treasure\" which actually gets little play is a diptych, or work of art in two panels, depicting Christ Crowned with Thorns and the Mater",
          "A refuge away from the crowds with some interesting religious artifacts. Somewhere to sit in the small garden shaded from the hot sun by the trees.",
          "Interesting experience. Disappointed to find the Pharmacy closed (it was Sunday though) which was the main reason for the visit as I was unwell!",
          "Access is from the end of Prijeko threading your way through the restaurant tables opposite. Don't make the mistake we did of going right up to the North City Gate. There is a beautiful quiet cloister round an attractive garden. Walking anti-clockwise you come to a simple but",
          "We did like the monastery but the visit is quite short, and there is not that much to see in the end.",
          "Short but very peaceful visit to the cloisters. Very reasonable entry fee to see the pretty courtyard and a few other exhibits. One in particular was interesting - showed the damage that had occurred during the war in the 90's. Recommend a quick stop.",
          "Something beautiful and definitely worth paying the ticket of 30.00 kn ( \u20ac 4.20 / $ 5.00 ) because there is much to see . Inside the monastery is quiet and peaceful and the museum is full of attractions . It is recommended , because I was a mistaken, not touring with other tours",
          "We visited this simply because it was included in the Dubrovnik Card. I particularly like cloisters but apart from that not a huge amount to see.",
          "A short visit and a peaceful wander round away from the busy crowds. There's not a lot to see but it is quiet.",
          "Very nice place to visit. Extremely interesting. It was damaged by the bombing during the war back in the early 90s but has been restored to its original state.",
          "Titans painting worth the fee alone but serenity of cloister even if you don't appreciate it at first is in hindsight grounding which in present terminology facilitates mindfulness!!!",
          "Combined with the Rector's and the Sponza palaces, this gives a good idea of Dubrovnik's splendid history. Beautiful cloister and art gallery, with one painting from Titian and other lesser known painters works. Go there while waiting for your boat !",
          "We went there with my boyfriend to take refuge from the rain. It is 30kn/person which is around 4~5\u20ac/person. Beautiful architecture, the little \"garden\" in the center was lovely. There was kind of a mystic atmosphere there with the rain, the storm and the songs of some monks",
          "Just inside the city gate it contains a centuries old but still working pharmacy, great architecture and art.",
          "This is a very attractive church and cloister with an art gallery including works by Titian as well as medieval artists and more modern local artists.",
          "Located on the left just inside the entry to the Old Town this is easily missed but what a gem. Peaceful,calm and serene.",
          "Historically beautiful and serene. Some beautiful art and artefacts located here. You must appreciate history if you truly wish to enjoy this visit.",
          "We had 30 mins to spare so with most other sites now seen we popped in, and found entrance fee reasonable and about right for the venue. Was full of interesting items and artefacts, loved the cartography in the old books, including the one with corrections, not something I would",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987. Often regarded as a 'Supergroup' due to the band members having played in various established bands such as Hoodoo Gurus, Beasts of Bourbon, and The Scientists. The band chose their name due to two members of the band Roddy Radalj (guitar vocals) and Boris Sujdovik (bass) being born in Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDalmatia\nDubrovnik chess set\nList of people from Dubrovnik\nRepublic of Ragusa\nTourism in Croatia\nWalls of Dubrovnik\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Ragusa\", Bradshaw's Hand-Book to the Turkish Empire, 1: Turkey in Europe, London: W.J.

        "wiki": "Knightfall is a historical fiction drama television series created by Don Handfield and Richard Rayner for the History channel. Filmed in the Czech Republic and Croatia, it premiered on December 6, 2017 in the United States. On August 13, 2018, History renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on March 25, 2019. In May 2020, it was announced that the series had been canceled.\nKnightfall recounts the success, fall, persecution, and suppression of the Knights Templar, as orchestrated by King Philip IV of France on October 13, 1307. The series focuses on the fictional Templar leader Landry du Lauzon, a brave warrior discouraged by the Templars' failures in the Holy Land who is reinvigorated by news that the Holy Grail has resurfaced.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n\n=== Main ===\nTom Cullen as Landry de Lauzon, a senior brother of the Knights Templar and a veteran of the Crusades, is a noble, courageous, and headstrong knight who began his service with the Templars as Godfrey's squire \u2013 Godfrey tutored and trained him into a skilled and respected warrior monk. After the Siege of Acre, Landry witnesses the failure of the Crusade, the conquest of the Holy Land by the Saracens and the loss of the most-prized relic in all of Christendom: the Holy Grail. 15 years later, Landry, his faith shaken and frustrated with the Order's inactivity, becomes Master and Commander of the Paris Temple after Godfrey's assassination, the subsequent investigation revealing the Grail is now in France. His hope reignited, Landry leads his fellow Templars on a journey to uncover the reasons behind his mentor's death and location of the Grail. Harry Webster portrays a young Landry in season 1.\nJim Carter as Pope Boniface VIII, a warm and avuncular man and a seasoned religious leader, who acts as a stabilizing, incorruptible force within a corrupt medieval world. The Templar Knights value him as their Holy leader, and they're willing to execute his orders without question. Boniface personally appoints Landry the new Master and Commander of the Paris Temple after Godfrey's assassination and entrusts him the mission of finding the Holy Grail, hoping to use it to launch a new Crusade and reclaim the Holy Land. Simon Haines portrays the younger Father Benedetto in season 2. (main season 1, featured season 2)\nP\u00e1draic Delaney as Gawain, the greatest swordsman of the Templar Order who was crippled by a leg injury sustained in the Siege of Acre while protecting Landry. 15 years later, after Godfrey's assassination, he is told by the new Master Landry he can no longer fight. Unable to serve in the field, Landry assigns him as the training master to the Order's initiates, teaching future knights, including the commoner Parsifal. Feeling his heroism is no longer celebrated, he struggles to maintain his loyalty to the Order, just as he struggles to come to terms with his physical limitations. Gawain feels that, of all the Templars, he has the most to gain from the recovery of the Holy Grail, due to its reported ability to heal.\nSimon Merrells as Tancr\u00e8de de Hauteville, a veteran Templar fiercely loyal to the order. Unlike most Templars, Tancrede was once married, but he gave up married life in order to join the Templars. As the steadfast, brave, and resolute knight who venerates his Templar vows above all else, Tancrede imagines himself as the heir apparent to Godfrey, the Master and Commander of the Paris Temple, although he concedes to Landry following Godfrey's assassination. With the revelation that the Holy Grail is now in France, Tancrede aids and advises Landry on his quest, and comes to understand what his role must be.\nJulian Ovenden as William de Nogaret, King Philip's scheming counsellor, pragmatic lawyer and right-hand man. De Nogaret is unashamedly godless, and a calculating manipulator ahead of his time. He is driven to destroy the power of organized religion, in revenge for his parents being burned at the stake as heretics for practising Catharism. Cool and supremely calculating, De Nogaret is more involved in the quest for the Holy Grail than he appears. He also secretly desires Philip's daughter, Isabella, while seeking to make her the next Queen of England. Freddie Preston portrays a young de Nogaret in season 2.\nOlivia Ross as Queen Joan, a formidable diplomat and strategist. Joan is a devoted mother who seeks to ensure her children, especially her daughter, marry for love rather than duty like she was to Philip, whom she has grown to fear. She and Philip are friends of Landry after he saved them from being murdered by brigands \u2013 against Landry's vows of celibacy, and without Philip's knowledge, the two pursued a secret romance and Joan is secretly pregnant with his child. (season 1)\nEd Stoppard as King Philip, known for his good looks (hence the nickname \u201cThe Fair\u201d), Philip struggles both as a King and a husband. He seeks to control his family while dealing with the politics and power moves that are an inevitable part of running his kingdom. Philip longs to be a great monarch and to transform France into the greatest power in Europe. He and Joan are friends of Landry after he saved them from being murdered by brigands, and Philip considers him a teacher, confidant and friend (although he is unaware of their secret romance).\nSabrina Bartlett (main season 1) and Genevieve Gaunt (recurring season 2) as Princess Isabella, Queen Joan and King Philip's daughter. Isabella is a beautiful, energetic and self-aware young woman whose youth belies a capacity to go to extraordinary lengths to get what she wants. Now of legal age, her impending marriage promises a strong political alliance for France.\nBobby Schofield as Parsifal, a young peasant farmer who is decent and honest, although is also brash and recklessly brave; aiming to do what he feels is right, even faced with great peril. He was happily engaged to a young woman, Marie, but is left consumed with grief and a desire for vengeance when she is murdered by Godfrey's assassins. Adrift and wanting to pursue her killers, he accepts an offer from Landry to join the Templars. (season 1)\nSarah-Sofie Boussnina as Adelina, a Jewish homeless thief who previously lived in Acre, but was rescued as a child by Landry and the Templars. Now living in France with her father, she is secretly involved with the unknown forces surrounding the Holy Grail. (season 1)\nTom Forbes as Prince Louis of France, King Philip and Queen Joan's eldest son and heir.

Mark Hamill was cast as Talus, an old Templar veteran of the Crusades who lived through a decade of captivity in the Middle East, and now tasked with training younger knights. One of his ex-students is Landry, once a master himself but forced to start over after breaking his vows in the first season. Tom Forbes was cast as Prince Louis, the violent and unpredictable son of King Philip.Genevieve Gaunt was cast in the recurring role of Isabella, King Philip's daughter and on her way to becoming the woman who history would call the \"she-wolf of France\". Gaunt replaced Sabrina Bartlett, who portrayed the princess in season one. Additional recurring roles include Irish actor Peter O'Meara as Chartres Temple Master Berenger, Underworld: Blood Wars actress Clementine Nicholson as Princess Margaret, Prince Louis's wife, and Claire Cooper as Sister Anne.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nProduction started with three days of filming during the last week of June 2016 in Dubrovnik on Croatia's southern Adriatic coast, with Douglas Mackinnon (Outlander) as director. Set mainly around the Walls of Dubrovnik's Fort Lovrijenac (St. Lawrence Fortress) and the bay of Pile, these scenes depict The Siege of Acre. PAKT Media offered their services, and over 140 Croatian film workers were involved with the production.Mackinnon served as the principal director, handling most episodes. Metin H\u00fcseyin and David Petrarca (Game of Thrones) also directed a block each. Knightfall was shot primarily in Prague, Czech Republic, with its base at the Barrandov Studios. Several exteriors imitating medieval Paris were built in surrounding suburbs and villages, including Pr\u016fhonice, and Doksany. Streets in Old Town and \u0160vihov Castle were utilized. Filming started on July 8. According to Barrandov CEO Petr Tich\u00fd, the studio was chosen partially based on the quality of the 15th-century interior they had previously built for Borgia. According to Tom Cullen, the main cast had a two-and-a-half week \"boot camp\" with French stuntman and fight choreographer C\u00e9dric Proust. Cullen had taken fencing classes in the past, but had not swung a sword in eight years. The total cost for the season was CZK 1.1 billion.On August 26, 2016, a fire broke out at the backlot of Barrandov Studios, destroying the exterior sets for Knightfall, with an estimated damage of 100 million CZK (US$4.5 million). Only a small part of the set, representing a medieval city, was saved. The following Monday, shooting resumed at another location in the city. The fire affected the production schedule, but the production was not to be moved to another city, and would focus on street locations. David Minkowski, a senior producer at Stillking Films, added, \"In conjunction with our insurers and Barrandov construction, we are planning to rebuild the destroyed backlot set as soon as possible and complete filming in Czech Republic,. Filming for the first season wrapped in mid-December 2016.The filming of the second season wrapped on December 19, 2018.Other locations in the Czech Republic that were used for filming the series included the Doksany Monastery, To\u010dn\u00edk Castle, Kost Castle near Libo\u0161ovice, Zv\u00edkov Castle and the Medieval Open-Air \u0158epora museum.\n\n\n== Release ==\nA teaser trailer debuted on February 1, 2017 on History Channel, depicting a bloody Templar helmet. The series premiered on December 6, 2017. The second season premiered on March 25, 2019.The series was pre-sold to SBS in Australia. HBO, its subsidiary Cinemax, and FilmBox Premium also obtained the rights in Central and Eastern Europe. History, which developed the original series, aired Knightfall in North America.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 60% based on 20 reviews, with an audience rating of 69%. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the series has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".Maureen Ryan of Variety said, \"This is a lumpy, awkwardly paced, derivative show that doesn\u2019t boast much in the way of impressive visuals or engaging characters. Those looking for a little light history will also likely be disappointed; the story\u2019s scattered nuggets about the context and history of the Templars are not typically made compelling in any way\".For the second season, Rotten Tomatoes listed only four reviews, with three favorable; two of the reviews praised the addition of Mark Hamill with one commenting that \"the barely recognizable Star Wars icon carries every scene in which he appears\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nKnightfall was nominated for Best Fantasy Television Series at the 44th Saturn Awards.\n\n\n== Other media ==\nIn May 2017, it was announced that A+E Networks had partnered with Titan Publishing to develop original novels and an eight-part comic book series based on the series.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial podcast\nKnightfall on IMDb",

          "This is something different and unique to see, just before you enter the busy street of Stradun in the Old Town. Someone would rather visit War Museum, but I say Love Rules. Some peace and quiet, to learn about the biggest love stories of the world and most importantly the ones",
          "This is a unique concept for a museum, but there must have been something wrong with the ventilation or air conditioning system because we were sweating buckets all the time we were inside. To her credit, the lady there gave us both bottles of cold water and offered us fans. But",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions.

        "wiki": "The Walls of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Dubrova\u010dke gradske zidine) are a series of defensive stone walls surrounding the city of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia. With numerous additions and modifications throughout their history, they have been considered to be amongst the great fortification systems of the Middle Ages, as they were never breached by a hostile army during this time period. In 1979, the old city of Dubrovnik, which includes a substantial portion of the old walls of Dubrovnik, joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.The oldest systems of fortifications around the town were likely wooden palisades. Today's intact city walls, constructed mainly during the 12th\u201317th centuries, mostly a double line, have long been a source of pride for Dubrovnik. The walls run an uninterrupted course of approximately 1,940 metres (6,360 ft) in length, encircling most of the old city, and reach a maximum height of about 25 metres (82 ft). The bulk of the existing walls and fortifications were constructed during the 14th and 15th centuries, but were continually extended and strengthened up until the 17th century.This complex structure, amongst the largest and most complete in Europe, protected the freedom and safety of a \"civilised\" and \"sophisticated\" republic that flourished in peace and prosperity for some five centuries. The walls were reinforced by three circular and 14 quadrangular towers, five bastions (bulwarks), two angular fortifications and the large St. John's Fortress. Land walls were additionally reinforced by one larger bastion  and nine smaller semicircular ones, like the casemate Fort Bokar, the oldest preserved fort of that kind in Europe. The moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls, which were armed by more than 120 cannons, provided superb city defense capabilities.\n\n\n== Former city walls ==\nThe construction of the first limestone forts around the city began in the Early Middle Ages, towards the end of the 8th century. But, the \"old chronicles\" say that some sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that. It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls, probably mainly by wooden palisades. The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long invasion by the Saracens in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified.The city first spread towards the uninhabited eastern part of the islet, which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city, near St. John's Fortress, is called Pustijerna. The name \"Pustijerna\" comes from the Latin statement \"post terra\", which means \"outside the town\". In the 9th and 10th centuries, the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city. When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in the 11th century, the city merged with the settlement on land, and soon, a single wall was built around the area of the present-day city core.During this same time period, Dubrovnik and the surrounding area were described as a part of the Croatian (Grwasiah) entity, in one of the works by the famous Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi. In his book Nuzhat al-Mushataq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq (English: \"Joy for those who wish to sail over the world\") from 1154, he mentioned Dubrovnik as the southernmost city of \"the country of Croatia and Dalmatia\". The basic city plan dates from 1292, when the port was rebuilt following a fire. The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century, except for the Dominican monastery, which came under its protection later on, during the 14th century.\n\n\n== Modern-day city walls ==\n\nThe city walls have been preserved to the present day, not only because of the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.\n\nThe present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from Venetian suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally unaffected by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667.\nThe largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Ragusan fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by Turkish military forces, especially after they conquered Constantinople in 1453.\nThe city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians. For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city-republic by skillful maneuvering between East and West. A strategic treaty with Turkey protected Ragusa's liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe.The irregular parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik consists of four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Min\u010deta Tower, and to the east side of the city port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, freestanding, St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as Lovrijenac), protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city.\n\n\n=== Land Walls ===\nThe main wall on the landside is 4 metres (13 ft) to 6 metres (20 ft) thick, and, at certain locations, the walls reach up to 25 meters (80 feet) in height.\nThe land walls stretch from Fort Bokar in the west to the detached Revelin Fortress in the east. On the landside, the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire, especially against possible Ottoman attacks.\n\n\n==== Gates ====\nThe town has four city gates: two that lead to the harbor and two (with drawbridges) that lead to the mainland. During the time period when the Austrian Empire controlled the city, two more gates were opened in the wall.Communication with the outside world on the land side was maintained with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side of the city and the other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.\n\n\n===== Gate of Pile =====\nThe Pile Gates are a well-fortified complex with multiple doors, defended by Fort Bokar and the moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls. At the entrance gate to the Old Town, on the western side of the land walls, there is a stone bridge between two Gothic arches, which were designed by the esteemed architect Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107 in 1471. That bridge connects to another bridge, a wooden drawbridge which can be pulled up. During the republican era, the wooden drawbridge to the Pile Gate was hoisted each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city's keys to the Ragusan rector. Today, it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds. Above the bridges, over the arch of town's principal gateway, there is a statue of city patron Saint Blaise (Croatian: Sveti Vlaho), with a model of the Renaissance city. After passing the Pile Gate's original Gothic inner gateway, it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls.\n\n\n===== Gate of Plo\u010de =====\nOn the eastern side of the land walls stands the second major entrance to the city, the Gate of Plo\u010de. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Plo\u010de was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107. Mili\u010devi\u0107 was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.\n\n\n===== Gate of Bu\u017ea =====\nThe Gate of Bu\u017ea (meaning \"hole\") is located on the northern side of the land walls. This gate is relatively new compared to the other gates, as it was constructed during the early 1900s.\n\n\n=== Sea Walls ===\nThe main wall on the sea-facing side of Dubrovnik stretches from Fort Bokar in the west to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5\u201316 feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance. The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.\n\n\n==== City Harbour ====\nOne of the oldest sectors of Dubrovnik was constructed around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today. It was constructed on the site of the Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107 in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Bo\u017eidarevi\u0107 around 1500.The most prominent portion of the harbour is the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large arsenal built in the late 12th century and enlarged in the latter part 15th century. The harbour is also the oldest shipyard within the city and is still in use today.Porporela was built in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty (Ka\u0161e Breakwater) was built in 1485, according to the design of Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves. The breakwater thus shortened the harbour's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder.Today, the arsenal hosts the City Caf\u00e9 and a movie theatre, whereas both the harbour and Porporela have become pleasant promenades and tourist attractions.\n\n\n==== Gates ====\nIn the city port area, one of the most significant areas of the maritime trade city, there were two entrances: the Gate of Ponte (port) and the Fishmarket Gate. The entire layout of the Dubrovnik streets, as well as a range of expansions, was intended for fast and effective communication with the forts of the city walls.\n\n\n===== Gate of Ponte =====\nConstructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is situated westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, built at the same period, leads from the Gate to St. John Fortress. The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century when the sewage system was completed, and building houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed.\n\n\n===== The Fishmarket Gate =====\nThe Fishmarket Gate, built in 1381, stands eastward from the Great Arsenal. The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where small boats were repaired, are situated a bit further. The old tower of St. Luke's protects the harbour in the east, and the harbour entrance is encircled and guarded by the Revelin Fortress.\n\n\n== Forts ==\n\n\n=== Forts within walls ===\nThe fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans was a clear sign to the cautious citizens of Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues. The fall of Bosnia, which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited the architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence to direct the improvement of the city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance for the defense of Dubrovnik.\n\n\n==== Min\u010deta Tower ====\nThe Min\u010deta Tower was built by a local builder named Nicifor Ranjina and Italian engineers sent by Pope Pius II in 1463, at the height of the Turkish threat. Originally as a strong four-sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the Men\u010deti\u0107 family, who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls. In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, Michelozzo built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low scarp walls. The full six-meter (20 feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Min\u010deta tower. He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the battlements are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.After a long excavation, a 16th-century cannon foundry was discovered under Min\u010deta Tower in Gornji ugao (Upper Tower). It is now a museum.Since Min\u010deta Tower is the highest point of the wall, it is considered to offer a seemingly \"unforgettable\" view on the city.\n\n\n==== Fort Bokar ====\nThe Fort Bokar, often called \"Zvjezdan\", is considered to be amongst the most beautiful instances of harmonious and functional fortification architecture. Built as a two-story casemate fortress by Michelozzo from 1461 to 1463, while the city walls were being reconstructed, it stands in front of the medieval wall face protruding into space almost with its whole cylindrical volume. It was conceived as the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate, the western fortified entrance of the city; and after the Min\u010deta Tower, it is the second key point in the defense of the western land approach to the city.\n\n\n==== St. John Fortress ====\nThe St. John Fortress (Croatian: Sveti Ivan), often called Mulo Tower, is a complex monumental building on the southeastern side of the old city port, controlling and protecting its entrance. The first fort was built in the mid 14th century, but it was modified on several occasions in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, which can be seen in the triptych made by the painter Nikola Bo\u017eidarevi\u0107 in the Dominican monastery. The painting shows Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik. Dominant in the port ambiance, the St. John Fortress prevented access of pirates and other enemy ships. Always cautious at the first sign of danger, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with heavy chains stretched between the St. John Fortress and the Kase jetty, and they also used to wall up all the port entries to the Great Arsenal.Today, the fortress houses an aquarium on the ground floor, stocked with fish from various parts of the Adriatic Sea. On the upper floors there is an ethnographic and a maritime museum devoted to the Republic Maritime Period, the Age of Steam, the Second World War, and the section of techniques of sailing and navigation.\n\n\n=== Detached forts ===\n\n\n==== Revelin Fortress ====\nIn the period of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a detached fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Plo\u010de Gate was built to the east of the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses in the service of the Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.The new Revelin became the strongest of the city fortresses, safeguarding the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped in the form of an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Plo\u010de Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic.\n\n\n==== St. Lawrence Fortress ====\n\nSt. Lawrence Fortress (Croatian: Lovrijenac), often called Dubrovnik's Gibraltar, is located outside the western city walls, 37 metres (121 ft) above sea level. The fortress has a quadrilateral court with mighty arches and, as its height is uneven, it has 3 terraces with powerful parapets with the broadest one looking south towards the sea. Lovrijenac was defended with 10 large cannons, the largest and most famous of which was called \"Lizard\" (Croatian: Gu\u0161ter). The walls exposed to enemy fire are almost 12 meters (39 feet) thick, but the large wall surface facing the city does not exceed 60 centimetres (2 feet). Two drawbridges lead to the fort, there being the inscription \"Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro\" \u2013 \"Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world.\" above the gate. To ensure loyalty, the troops in St. Lawrence Fortress were rotated every 30 days. And to ensure complete loyalty, they were given only 30 days of rations when they went into the fort. According to old scripts it was built in only three months.Today its interior is one of the most dignified stages in Europe, and a well-known place for William Shakespeare's Hamlet performances.\n\n\n== Fortifications around Dubrovnik ==\n\n\n=== Walls of Ston ===\n\nThe Walls of Ston are originally a series of defensive stone walls of more than 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) long. Despite its small size, the well protected Republic of Ragusa decided to use Pelje\u0161ac to build another line of defense. At Pelje\u0161ac's narrowest point, just before joining the mainland, a wall from Ston to Mali Ston was built.\nToday's 5.5-kilometre (3.4 mi) long wall that links these two small communities has the shape of a pentagon. It was completed in the 15th century along with other 40 towers and 5 fortresses. The \"wall\" meant protection to the precious salt pans that greatly contributed to Dubrovnik's wealth, which are still being worked today.\n\n\n=== Falcon Fortress ===\n\nThe Falcon Fortress (Croatian: Sokol Grad) was one of the largest and most important fortresses on the territory of the Republic of Ragusa, due to its position in the mountainous region near the Bosnian inland. It was built at the location of earlier Illyrian and later Roman fortifications, evident from the remains of ceramics and Roman bricks in its walls. In 1391, the Sankovi\u0107 brothers, at that time the rulers of Konavle, gave to the Republic of Rag full authority over the Falcon Fortress, while it came under republic's final possession only in 1423.Due to its strategic importance, the Republic of Ragusa constantly invested in the maintenance of the fortress, which contained a cistern, a powder storage, wine and food cellars, sentry-boxes, military barracks, and sanctuary buildings to accommodate refugees from nearby villages in the event of war.\n\n\n=== Imperial Fortress ===\n\nThe Fortress is placed at the top of the mountain Sr\u0111, just above the city of Dubrovnik. It was built in 1806 by Marshal Marmont, called the Imperial, in honor of emperor Napoleon. The fortress was strategically important to defend the northern side of the city.\n\n\n=== Prevlaka Fortress ===\n\nThis fortress is placed at Ponta O\u0161tro, at the very end of Prevlaka peninsula. It was built in the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor at the time of the Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time. Today, the fortress is out of use and badly damaged by various destructions during history.\n\n\n== City walls during sieges ==\n\n\n=== Saracen siege in 866\u2013867 ===\n\nIn 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, and then laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending over one hundred ships. Finally, the 866\u2013867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the intervention of Basil I, who sent a fleet under the command of Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.\n\n\n=== Venetian siege in 948 ===\n\nWith the weakening of Byzantium, Venice began to see Ragusa as a rival who needed to be brought under her control, but the attempt to conquer the city in 948 failed. The citizens of the city attributed this to Saint Blaise, whom they adopted as the patron saint of the city.\n\n\n=== Nemanja's siege in 1185 ===\n\nAfter some territorial disputes, war broke out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Ra\u0161ka, and the city of Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly.\n\n\n=== Venetian and Fourth Crusades siege in 1205 ===\n\nIn 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia with the forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, eventually becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.\n\n\n=== Siege by Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da in 1451 ===\n\nIn 1451, the very powerful Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.\n\n\n=== Russian siege in 1806 ===\n\nBy 1800, the Republic had a highly organized network of consulates and consular offices in more than eighty cities and ports around the world. In 1806, the Republic surrendered to the forces of the First French Empire to end a months-long siege by the Russian and Montenegrin fleet during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city. The French lifted the siege and Ragusa was saved. The French army, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, entered Dubrovnik in 1806. In 1808, Marshal Auguste de Marmont abolished the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamated its territory into the French Illyrian Provinces, himself becoming the \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse).\n\n\n=== Anglo-Austrian siege in 1814 ===\n\nAustria declared war on France in August 1813 and by the Autumn the Royal Navy enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea. Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy Rear Admiral Thomas Fremantle's ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic ports one after another December. Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns) along with HMS Saracen an 18 gun brig, arrived at Ragusa already blockaded by Pro Austrian Croat forces led by Todor Milutinovi\u0107. The British with the Austrians were able to take the Imperial fortress and positions on Lokrum island. By hauling cannon up to Sr\u0111 hill they bombarded the city until the French General Joseph de Montrichard decided it was best to surrender. British and Croat troops entered the city via the Pile gates shutting the Ragusan rebels out.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav army siege in 1991\u20131992 ===\n\nThe Siege of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Opsada Dubrovnika) is a term marking the battle and siege of the city of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area in Croatia as part of the Croatian War of Independence. Dubrovnik was besieged and attacked by forces of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in late 1991, with the major fighting ending in early 1992, and the Croatian counterattack finally lifting the siege and liberating the area in mid-1992. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the prosecution alleged that, \"It was the objective of the Serb forces to detach this area from Croatia and to annex it to Montenegro.\"In 1991, the American Institute of Architects condemned the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, in conjunction with UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) had been hit by projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It is a testament to the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFort Lovrijenac\nList of walls\nList of cities with defensive walls\nList of castles in Croatia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Main sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOld City of Dubrovnik \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre\nVideo, Dubrovnik Digital reconstruction by GRAIL at Washington University\n(in Croatian) Dru\u0161tvo prijatelja dubrova\u010dke starine \u2013 Gradske zidine",

          "From the harbor, the fortress is a long way. The length of the path is not the problem, but rather the slope. Unfortunately, the steep part of the path is not shady. You should not let that stop you anyway. The view \u2026",
          "The surroundings are a little steep but the view is very beautiful from the top. The old Napoleonic construction was taken over by the Austrians and surely more recently. The outbuildings near the fort are very \u2026",
          "A place worth climbing. At a temperature of + 30 \u00b0 C, you can say a job as a peak. Take a break with the water, serving low at the top.\n\n",
          "Wonderful place\n\n",
          "The reviews are consistently positive, but I have some criticisms.\n\nThe increase is really extremely strenuous and exhausting at 30 \u00b0 C and very slippery.\n\nThe ruin is not necessarily maintained or signposted.\n\nFor \u2026",
          "The island of Lokrum is very nice for a day trip. By cons, the price of the boat is anything: 150 kuna for 10 minutes crossing. We are not Americans to pluck!\n\n",
          "Immersed in the feeling of being in another when ... a time stopped .... a leap between fantasy and the Middle Ages .... only the eternal long flow of people takes you back to our present\n\n",
          "Nice place of interest in Dubrovnik. Beautiful views of the city walls and many GoT scenes are included here.\n\n",
          "Nice view of the sea and Dubrovnik! Difficult climb !! Sturdy footwear a must\n\n",
          "Great for a walk\nIt was so hot in summer but good memories\n\n",
          "The trip to the fort is fine but the fort is one empty shell.\n\n",
          "Fortress on top of Locrum Island, facing Dubrovnik.\n\n",
          "Fortress on the top of the island, if you make the way to paradise, which is steep, tiring especially if with the sun, arriving at the Fortress you can climb it and see an amazing panorama\n\n",
          "Beautiful view. Too bad for its current state\n\n",
          "The fort itself is not worth it. A pile of old stones, partially collapsed. For that you get a 360 degree panorama with views of Dubrovnik incl. Old Town and the open sea. The path is very rocky in the truest sense. \u2026",
          "Great scenery\nThe way up\nSneakers\nIt is easy.\nThere is no shade in the ascent\nThe bench in the middle\nThere\nI can take a rest.\n\n",
          "Impressive example of civil engineering. Very well preserved The climb route is as hard as it is beautiful.\n\n",
          "From fort Royal there is a lot to go. If you love to explore, this adventure will take you to discover beautiful landscapes and fauna of the place. Forbidden to camp, feed the animals and build campfires. There are \u2026",
          "This is one round tower, a few walls and ruins. The tower overlooks Dubrovnik. The road from the pier is quite tiring: all the way up, especially the last 300 meters steeper and steeper.\n\n",
          "If you visit Lokrun, you should also go to the fort. The climb is a bit tedious and exhausting, but the view of the old town is worthwhile. The fort itself is not really exciting, but the view is a dream\n\n",
          "A difficult increase. The view is equal\n\n",
          "Historically to see. Beautiful view of the whole bay of Dubrovnik\nPlan a good climb.\n\n",
          "A view of Dubrovnik and the wonderful sea. You have to book a minimum of 3 hours on the island, assuming that we are out of the tourist season.\n\n",
          "A beautiful view of Dubrovnik!\n\n",
          "Only worth it if you like views. On top of the fort (only one tower) you can look reasonably 360 degrees. The view on Dubrovnic is very limited by trees. The climb goes via a style path. Beside fort old house \u2026",
          "It is worth visiting, because it defends the entrance to the port, and it is on the fairway, but it gets there with a dry leg crossing the water\n\n",
          "Great view of Dubrovnik\n\n",
          "Central, but not the best place on the island. The review is in many cases covered with trees. There will be a lot going to the mountain. Unlike the park in Split, it was not impressive.\n\n",
          "Very strenuous climb, as it is the highest point of the island, but worth the view.\n\n",
          "Great views, it is definitely worth visiting even if the climb on the hill is quite heavy.\n\nWith amazing views, it is worth to visit, though the uphill climb is a pretty hard experience especially in the heat. \u2026"

She received an A.B. from the University of Chicago and a M.S. from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\n\n== Work ==\nBerman is a documentary photographer, author and educator. Much of her photographic work focuses upon the American political and social landscape, including the militarization of American life and the dialogue around war, patriotism and sacrifice. Berman is the author of two monographs: Purple Hearts \u2013 Back From Iraq, and Homeland. Her photographs and videos have been exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum, Dublin Contemporary 2011 and the 2010 Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial.

Her work with high school students continued in 2010 in collaboration with the Whitney Museum of American Art as an artist in residence with the museum\u2019s Youth Insights program. In 2011, Berman developed a high school art curriculum with the Whitney Museum of American Art based on her images of wounded American veterans from the Iraq War and her Homeland series.

          "It is particularly fitting that the museum is housed within the old Napoleonic Fort Imperial as this was the main location for those defending Dubrovnik during the seige of the town during the Croatian War of Independence or \"Homeland War\" in the 1990's. It's highpoint above",
          "I traveled by Cable car and visited this Museum titled \"Dubrovnik during the Homeland war\" located at Mt Srd. Inside the ancient Fort Imperial, this permanent Museum dedicated to seige Dubrovnik narrate most agonizing part of Croatian history and war of Independence (1991-1995).",
          "The museum is in the bunkers that run under Mount Srd, where the worst of the fighting took place. The walls are filled with photographs of the people, the places, the destruction. Bizarrely, the most touching part were the newsreels that play constantly; we watch the News At",
          "We did this when we visited fort to watch the sunset. Small but interesting as I remember the news reels. Good setting actually in the fort that was attacked . Educational",
          "This Museum is a must see. The bravery of the ordinary people of Croatia is just amazing. The TV and the individual stories of the people is truly moving. The story of the war is so recent and therefore so raw and moving it is a must see for a anyone visiting Dubrovnik. The",
          "Interesting insights into the War, located in the napoleonic fort that was key to the defence of Dubrovnik. Displays of weaponry and lots of stuff to read. Video exhibits show the story as told by the world\u2019s media. Spectacular views from the roof too",
          "Very inexpensive museum with interesting exhibits and comprehensive reports and displays explaining the recent conflict. As with any war museum the displays don't make for easy reading, more particularly because the events happened so recently and didn't end until 2001. Like",
          "As you experience a wonderful day in the Old Town, it is difficult to imagine that there was a war +25 years ago. The museum is small and is located on Mount Srd. If you are taking the cable car up, its a 5 minute walk to get here. The museum serves as a reminder than no one",
          "This is excellent museum which covers the homeland war of 1991 and how Dubrovnik was defended from this fort on top of the hill overlooking the city, it is plain to be seen how patriotic the people of Dubrovnik are and why they owe so much to the \u201cdefenders\u201d of the city,",
          "A MUST-SEE while in the area. This museum brought the 1991 conflict into real life for us. Very powerful, emotionally. My husband and I are 60+, and we walked up the \"hill\" instead of taking the cable car. It was very do-able, plus the views along the way were outstanding.",
          "The museum is set in the fortress about the old town. It is really interesting with many confronting images of the Croatian war in the early 1990's. The walk up to the forte (if you don't want to wait inline for the cable car) is also enjoyable and offers great views.",
          "The museum of Croatian War of Independence is a must if you visit Dubrovnik and you are interested in history. The view in the museum is beautiful, and you learn what the locals have been trough. Interesting to walk in the old city and still see the damage of some hits.",
          "This museum was worth the trip to the top, no matter what method you chose. As others have said the ITN news segments are very sobering and act as a reminder of how recent this war was.",
          "This museum dedicated to the siege of Dubrovnik during the 'Homeland War' is a very sobering affair, with the ITN news reports and testimonials a major part of the museum. The Croatian POV isn't subtle and some of the English text comes across as a bit too pro-Croatian compared",
          "It seems like yesterday the awful and terrible homeland war focused on the planned destruction by enemy forces of the Old City. Lest we forget. Peace is fragile and should never be taken for granted.",
          "To fully understand this beautiful city and it\u2019s people, I would recommend going here to visit the fort and learn about the significant history of Dubrovnik, Croatia and the whole region with write-ups, photos, artifacts and videos. Very close to cable car building. We spent",
          "A museum to the war of 1991 - 1995. Lots of photographs and testimonials from the people who were involved. My only critique would be it could be laid out with a bit more leaning towards a events as they happened.",
          "The museum is a must for all interested in local history. It is a well documented period in which Croatia battled for its independence. The commentary, photos and exhibits appear balanced in explaining what happened in 1991/92, without any detailed grahic displays of atrocities.",
          "I drove here up the single track mountain road. NEVER DO THIS. It was terrifying. The museum was informative with a looped video of BBC and ITN news reports of the shelling of the city. There were a few exhibits but fascinating reading and photos. This place should be visited to",
          "Small entrance charge. very well laid out museum, tragic and heartbreaking story of the war in Croatia. If you don't want to walk up the hill or pay the astronomic charge for the cable car to get to the museum, then suggest an Uber and a walk back down the hill at sunset.",
          "Housed in a Napoleonic era fort close to the cable car station this fine museum tells the story of the battle for Dubrovnik in the \u201chomeland war\u201d and there are also other rooms dealing with war crimes and atrocities which you\u2019d have thought belonged in the ancient past. There\u2019s",
          "So hard to believe, let alone witness the evidence of man's inhumanity to man! Emotional to see the loss of human life and level of devastation, suffered by defenceless people. We are amazed and so impressed by the resilience of the citizens of this beautiful city and how",
          "Having arrived at the top station of the cable car and taken as many photos as we could ever need, we wandered around aimlessly. Passing the buggies for rent we saw an old building and on investigation it turned out to be a museum. A surprise we are happy we did not miss. The",
          "This was for me a moving experience. It makes one wonder, how humans can treat other humans in such ways. Have we not yet realised, that without the politics, we are all just human beings? Take the time to read the text, and you may see things differently. Sadly, this did not",
          "The faces over the persons killed look at you from the picture gallery and you cannot help but feel guilty and sorry for the lack of support Croatia recieved. Small room,big message.",
          "My other half and I remembered the news footage in the UK at the time but didn\u2019t really grasp the enormity of what was actually happening. This museum has been very well put together using a mix of stills, videos, voiceovers, army documents and an amazingly vivid range of",
          "Having gone up Mount Srd on the cable car this was a well laid out and informative museum showing the resilience of the Croatian people during this war. Well laid out and only 30 HKN entry. Definitely worth a visit",
          "This really is a place to visit to view an indepth account of the suffering endured by the people of Croatia during this attrocity. Very sobering with great photographic & physical exhibits.",
          "You can get this attraction included on your cable car journey my recommendation is that you do as this is a very sobering place to visit with some very gruesome facts and figures about the war in the not too in the distant past, the horrors the sites and the stories are",
          "This museum offers very good displays and descriptions of Croatia's war of independence. It really was difficult to see the pictures of 1991 bombings that took place in the very city we were touring, Dubrovnik. Cash only.",
          "This gives you photos of what happened. Being from the USA there was not much coverage of what the Croatian people went through. If you are interested in history or if you are of Croatian heritage it is a must see.",
          "Well laid out museum outlining the attacks on Dubrovnik during the homeland war. Had the added bonus of being given a tour around by someone who was there during the attacks.",
          "It features many walls giving an in-depth account of the war. The quality of the text translated into English is poor and doesn\u2019t make sense. It describes the war but does not explain how it started or how it was resolved. A video is shown with brief Itn news report of the",
          "Posters have photos and a story in both Croatian and English. Used weapons and shells. There\u2019s a video film sequence from News at Ten lasting a good 10+ minutes. Nobody left the room until they had seen it all. The fort was built by Napoleon, he knew a thing or two. It\u2019s solid.",
          "To fully understand the war you must visit the museum. Plenty of information from the displays and video. I came away better informed.",
          "Combine the cable car with a visit to this museum. It was heavily attacked during the Balkans war in the early 1990s and the shell marks and damage is clearly seen in the building and also in the exhibits inside. Of 27000 dwellings in Dubrovnik at the time something like 12500",
          "This was an exhibition we felt duty bound to visit and whilst it was very poignant and interesting it needs a bit more in the way of film footage of the area to bring the story to life. Other than this, it was worth the visit",
          "This museum used to be best accessed by Cable Car which is currently closed so we chose a taxi to get to the museum. The taxi ride was a little scary due to the sheer drop and the numbers of taxis trying to make the journey. The museum is a fascinating insight into Croatia's",
          "Given the cable car is not operating (for the foreseeable future) its a taxi, Uber, tuktuk or walk. We got a Uber from where the cable car used to start HRK165, it\u2019s a narrow road and there were lots of cars trying to negotiate it. We were dropped at the museum/fort. Driver",
          "Had to give this an average review as I never got to experience it. Being my last day, I was a bit short of cash but figured I could use a card. Nope. In this day of mobile, wifi- based PDQ machines, this is a bit of an oversight. Especially annoying as the cable car was still",
          "Actually our tour guide recommended us this site to explore due to the bad weather. It seems that there has been a war over here 30 years ago. Poor people and the city recovered really good from it as there are no signs of it through out the city. Really interesting visit to",
          "The museum contains mostly panels which include photographies and long pieces of texts telling the story of the 1991 war. It feels someone had extracted pages from a history book and placed/ them all along the walls without summarising the story. You can buy a book and get the",
          "We were here as part of an excursion from a cruise ship. So we had a docent who was in the military during the war speaking to us. His first hand experience was what made it so educational and interesting. He said for 20 years he was unable to speak of the war, but had overcome",
          "The Croatian War of Independence is not something we knew a lot about, so we went to this museum in the fort. The views from the top of the fort are stunning and well worth the climb. There is a lot of reading to be done in the museum, but there is also newsreel footage from",
          "We were some of the first who entered this exhibition which was opened again in the beginning of April. There were two exhibitions, the first was of the War in Iran and the second of the War of Independence in Croatia.",
          "While not the most well laid out or sophisticated museum, it was an interesting and moving introduction to the Croatian war of independence - and specifically of the experience of the citizens of Dubrovnik. At times it went into so much detail (especially of the military jargon",
          "The building itself is very interesting and there is a roof top view which was tranquil on my visit. The exhibition shows the very recent history of this war and the impact on the local area. This was moving, especially seeing UK news coverage of some of the bombing. I would",
          "After a marvellous walk up to the fort, this museum was our best experience in 4 days in commercial, touristy Dubrovnik. We are not athletic and in our 50s so took our time walking up Mount Srd enjoying the panoramic views of the Adriatic and the old town. The museum is basic",
          "During our Croatian vacation, we visited numerous museums treating of the Yugoslavian war. While some were interesting, this one definitely fell short. First, the explanations are very confusing from the get-go, as the panels use a lot of military acronyms that are never",
          "We did not know exactly what to expect from this museum, however once we were inside it seemed as if we had entered another world. The exhibits, the photos, the videos, the objects, the information provided, all contributed in making this visit an extremely moving experience.",
          "At the top of the mountain in an old fort, a museum that considers all aspects of the war which tore at the fabric of everyday life in Croatia. Well laid out displays in a building whose architecture lends a somberness to the exhibits, I found myself quite moved by the",
          "Took the cable car up (ahead of the crowds in morning) and spent well over an hour in this really informative museum. It really was the most moving experience seeing the many photographs and the videos including news reports of the Croatian War of Independence, you could see",
          "At the top of the cable car ride. Informative way to spend an hour. Best telling of the story and news footage of the siege of the old town in 1991 brought to life. 30kn admission. Worth it.",
          "Ot is located in Fort Imperial on top of Mount Srd I visited the Museum by taking the cable car up. I bought a combined ticket for the Museum and cable car so it cost me 180 HRK, which was an extra 30 HRK. The Imperial Fort has an interesting history. Built by the French in",
          "As Americans, we have no idea what it's like to have been through a war that the living can still remember. This exhibit provides that perspective; it shows what the Croatians and local Dubrovnik residents went through, which is a must-see for those of us who want to understand",
          "Visited this museum as we remembered when the war happened. It was a sad reminder of what this city and country went through. Where we stayed, our hosts father was a soldier that helped to defend the city and the fort was a location he had helped to protect. You get an",
          "Off the beaten track, at the top of Mount Srd ( which can only be accessed by the cable car, or by foot...maybe not!) This is a very reasonably priced museum that highlights by a photographic journey the devastating and incredible sacrifice that the city of Dubrovnik experienced",
          "A fascinating insight to the history of Dubrovnik that has been overshadowed of late by Game of Thrones and Star Wars. Worth the trip up the mountain for this alone",
          "All the cable car people stayed in the cable car area, but 100 feet away the fort is excellent. Moving with the history of the 1991 war. TV clips from the times and photos. BEST view ever of Dubrovnic from the roof top area, seriously amazing view. Buy your ticket with the cable",
          "At the top of the hill where the cable car stops, you can visit this museum. Incredible to think that this happened 1991-1995 The museum is really amazing, and very well set out ! We decided to skip the cable car, as with the cruiseliners in town, there were thousands of",
          "The movies, photos, and relics of the wars show the details of the attacks on Croatia and Dubrovnik in the 1990's. I was saddened to learn more about what happened in my lifetime that I wasn't aware of. It's hopeful to see the recovery this town has made. The climb to the top of",
          "This is a very enlightening experience for those of us who are not fully conversant of the impact of these wars on the people of Dubrovnik in particular. The entry fee is modest, the venue of a Napoleonic fort a significant one in itself, and the displays well put together.",
          "It was a bit hard to follow at times (some of the translations were a bit clumsy) but this was a very moving, and important, exhibit. As youngsters in the UK, we were aware of the war, but never in this much detail and we really learned about the importance of Dubrovnik, and",
          "Worth the \u00a33 entrance fee full of interesting historical facts about the war for independence and highlighted the horrific time the Croats went through",
          "We visited this place at the top of the cable car, in the old Fort Imperiale. The representation of the Yugoslav war was tremendous and so informative. It really brought home the unnecessary aggression and destruction inflicted upon the Croatian people especiall those in",
          "A slightly more hidden museum in Dubrovnik, as it is located outside the higher cable car entrance. The admission fee is quite reasonable (30kn) which seems low for Dubrovnik. The museum is about 6 rooms long and talks through the battles for Dubrovnik in the Croatian war, with",
          "To understand modern conflict ..... War is just politics pursued in another way... The Museum & Photo Gallery are essential viewing. After walking the city walls, these were the best / most valuable parts of 5 nights in Dubrovnik.",
          "I could have spent hours in here reading all the information about the war. The museum is laid out perfectly and the thoroughness of the information is excellent. It's a sad reminder of what happened in Croatia and what war means to the region.",
          "I wasn't sure about visiting this museum, but after going up the mountain on the cable car there wasn't much else to do. WOW!!! This shocked me. An old Napoleonic fort overlooking the old town, and used as a position to shell those down below. There are photos of how Dubrovnik",
          "A very important , heartbreaking but interesting and essential museum. The photography is good and I liked the idea to tell the story of the War via photographs and an accompanying guide book. A quiet and thoughtful way to spend an hour or two within the noise , hustle and",
          "We visited this on a joint ticket wth cable car. The exhibits were well layed out indifferent areas, with many pictures of the war. There was a film to watch which was bbc news footage. The exhibition brought back all those memories from those troubled times.",
          "I remember the war in what was Yugoslavia very well, and was horrified to see the anguish of the people shown in the pictures, so many beautiful buildings damaged, but thankfully now restored to their former glory very well worth a visit, when using the cable car",
          "The museum is worth visiting, especially since you get access to the roof of the fort for a great view of the sun set. In terms of what\u2019s on offer in the museum though, there\u2019s a whole lot of shells, missiles, guns and reading. It\u2019s a pity so much of the museum involves",
          "The recent history and the homeland war is superbly recorded in this museum. My only criticism is that the lay out could be better",
          "This museum pulls no punches about how outraged Croatians were that their beautiful UNESCO world heritage listed city became a war zone, that their people died and suffered as a result of this war and that they were not supported. Set in a stunning fort, this museum displays",
          "This is definitely worth the 30KN entry free. It is an incredibly detailed exhibition with lots to take in. Some of the translation is a bit dodgy so be prepared to sift the information as you read, but on the whole it is a chilling insight into a very modern war. There is a",
          "THis place gives a good view of what happened in the Homeland invasion. While it may be one-sided, we are visiting Dubrovnik. We found it very interesting. The cable car up was a bonus.",
          "Very well put together displays on the fighting around Dubrovnik, though only military heads might have been interested in the in-depth description of army unit organisation. Doesn't even pretend to offer a balanced viewpoint (the Serbs are barely mentioned by name, instead",
          "Worth spending an hour getting away from the glitz of the city, it's a reminder of the horrors of the siege of Dubrovnik. Good interpretation of a contemporary war.",
          "a well organized self guided tour. Superb photos and a factual history. Excellent value. Even more fun if you hike up there from town and imagine what it was like to have to defend the city",
          "I respect the fact that Crotians didnt forget what they had to go thru to protect their identity. This museums is a testimony of serbian genocide in the Ballkan region",
          "My wife and I visited here during recent trip to Dubrovnik. Initially we were going to take the cable car one afternoon but the queue was too long to stand in the midday heat. We took an Uber taxi direct from our hotel to the museum on the top of the mountain which was an",
          "This small museum, is housed in the fort that was the symbol of Dubrovnik's fight in the civil war of the early 1990s. The story is told clearly and in English/Croatian, with pictures/posters and maps. There is also a very well presented video of excerpts from ITN \"News at Ten\"",
          "I remember this going on but watching the old BBC reports showing the loss and the damage was very thought provoking. I now understand a lot better what happened and just how awful it was. The fort is lovely and cool and there were some incredible photos from before and after.",
          "Set in a fort which has been left exactly as it was at the end of the Siege of Dubrovnik in 1991-2. It tells the story in great detail, no doubt of great interest to Croatians, but a little too much detail for foreigners. Its a case of not seeing the wood for the trees,",
          "Lovely little museum which really helps you understand what the people of Dubrovnik went through during the war of 1991. Interesting for me as I can remember this war on TV, but the museum really shows how the Old Town and surrounding areas were effected in terms of",
          "To my shame I remember this war being shown on TV at the time, but it was nevertheless very interesting to learn about it in detail. Take stairs to the top of the fortress for fabulous views of the old town.",
          "It's easy to forget that there was a war in Western Europe less than a quarter of a century ago. This museum tells the story of the siege of Dubrovnik, one part of that war. A fantastic little museum located in the fort on top of Mount Srd. Posters/text are in Croatian and",
          "Simple but informative and thought provoking exhibition. Musn\u2019t miss it if you take the cable car. Important to know Dubrovnik\u2019s recent history.",
          "We visited this museum at the top of the cable car. Mor people should go! It was very interesting, especially as we know so little of the history of the time.",
          "It\u2019s so easy to visit somewhere eat drink and move on. We were a family of 4 visiting Dubrovnik. The museum was on my to do list. Dubrovnik is an incredible city but if you\u2019d visited 25 years ago you\u2019d probably have been injured or died. The museum is fairly basic but",
          "WOW - so many killed and so recent, this museum says it all. Touches on the attack by Serbs and Montenegro and the lives that were lost.",
          "Well worth a visit if you are already there but not good enough to visit specifically. Information could have been more concisely laid out.",
          "Housed perfectly in the Imperial Fort, the museum tells the story of the Homeland War. Being where some of the most important fighting took place gives a different perspective and greater understanding of local history. My only issue is that there is a lot to read , particularly",
          "It is really an eye opener to go through this museum to see what happened so manyy years ago. There are still some ruins in places as well as you can still see bullet holes in the walls",
          "Small museum at the top of Mount Srd that provides an interesting insight into the war that happened in the not so distant past. Tickets can be bought in combination with the cable car or individually",
          "This gives a very good (although obviously biased) insight into the terrible events of the early 1990s. Lots of pictures and personal stories. Not crowded and makes the journey up the cable car more worthwhile.",
          "At times hard to see the recent suffering when Dubrovnik was under siege in the 1991 conflict for Croatian independence. Lots of photographs and explanations in English as well as artefacts from the war as well as newsreel coverage from the time. Well worth getting off the",
          "A quiet thoughtful journey into the history of the old town and the country. Stunning photos, video, maps and recollections of a troubled past that is in our recent memory. You can't help but feel anger, amazement, wonder and joy at the sheer courage of the people and despair at",
          "Worth going to see once you take the cable car up to the top. Napoleonic-era fort houses the Museum. We read everything in each room... lots of material, detail, references. Most people would enjoy it more if they just went to the 3rd room and watched the videos of the action",
          "We visited the museum as part of a combo ticket with the cable car ride. Well curated using photos, props and videos to describe the time during the war in the 90's",
          "A very well presented overview of what took place not that long ago. The boards explain as you walk round the events that took place and imact on the city and people. Very moving indeed.",
          "Great museum, well laid out and informative. Lovely views from the roof of Dubrovnik and surrounding countryside.",
          "If the topic at all interests you, definitely check out the museum. Especially enjoyed the news broadcast videos. Learned a lot & was very interesting.",
          "Excellent museum on Mount Srd describing the day to day events during the Siege of Dubrovnik in December 1991.",
          "The photos and artefacts from the terrible war only 25 years ago informed my understanding of what the residents of the City endured.",
          "We visited the museum on a tuk tuk excursion from a cruise ship. I found it compelling and interesting, although very aware obviously of the war I confess I hadn't much knowledge of the situation or indeed what it was all about. Our guide was very informative and obviously",
          "This little museum on the top of Mt. Srd provides an extremely detailed chronology of the defense of Dubrovnik during the 1991 war. But it does not provide any context for the war or the attack on Dubrovnik or any big picture information at all. Instead you get excruciating",
          "This is well worth a visit in association with the cable car. Located in the Old Napoleonic fort and offering the best view of Dubrovnik old town from it's roof that alone is enough reason to visit. Inside is a detailed account of the fighting in 1991/92 in and around the city.",
          "In this museum you will understand that even in the end of XX century in Europe is possible to have a war. Not just armed conflict but real WAR! During our stay my 16y son asked lots of questions about this war and as I didn\u00b4t know most of the fact, we decided to visit the",
          "When you ride the cable car to the top of Mt Srd , be sure to visit the war museum . The photos and video presentations will help to galvanize in your mind the horrible bomb attacks that seriously damaged the old city below the site of the museum. Then walk through the streets",
          "The Croatian Homeland War confuses me,and visiting this museum helped me better understand the challenges Dubrovnik faced when attacked. There are many pictures, and I often found it difficult to understand the main ideas presented (probably easier to follow for those who have",
          "Visiting this museum is worth the trip to Mount Srd. You can see artifacts and photos of the destruction caused just about 25 years ago. \"Man's inhumanity to man\" struck a chord with me. This war is still very fresh in the residents' mind and they will frequently reference pre-",
          "This tell the story of the Croatian war in the 90's. These people have always tried to deal with life with diplomacy, not war, but yet had to suffer through this terrible time. If you get the chance, visit. It is an eye-opener.",
          "Tucked away in the fort on the hill top this can easily be missed but do go and visit as it tells you the story of the civil war less than 30 years ago! Seeing the devastation of the old town and how it is now reminds you what a fantastic job the people have done to restore and",
          "Once you visit Dubrovnik some may find it hard to understand why such a beautiful and unique city was under attack in the early 90s. This museum has the answers and more. Lots of helpful pictures and stories and news reels from that time being played whilst you are at the scene",
          "When you visit this museum you will appreciate what the Kroatians have done to make Dubrovnik into what it is today. Almost everything was destroyed. Also; The museum itself is an important historical place.",
          "Despite having young children we felt it was important that we make time to visit this Museum. This museum is very respectful,very ponient, and very understated. you will leave the museum with total respect for the young men who lost their lives defending Dubrovnik.",
          "We found this after taking the cable car ride. It is to the left inside the large castle looking building. It was 30 kuna to get in. We found this to be a pleasant surprise and did not know all the history of the war in Dubrovnik. Also, you can get unobstructed views of",
          "Visited today with my husband, this brought the destruction to the for front for us. We saw the old town in ruins through pictures and from the news report you can watch inside the fort. One of the places is the arches in front of the harbour at the old town now a restaurant",
          "My wife and I visited this museum after walking up Mount Srd. We had high expectations but left somewhat disappointed. There is a lot in the exhibition but we felt it was poorly organised and the English translations were hard to understand. We really wanted to learn about this",
          "We only found this as it was by the Buggy safari we were booked on but I learnt so much, I would recommend this as a must for everyone who visits Dubrovnik",
          "At the top of the mountain just around the corner from the cable car is this little museum which would be easy to miss. Very interesting and informative with a variety of exhibits including photos, ITN news footage and weapons. It was hard to believe this beautiful place had",
          "This museum basically only has postersnon the wall with lot of small text. Takes a lot of time to get some kind of idea avout the war and what the museum tries to say. Not good with kids. Best part was interesting documentary film running in there. There is also a terrace with a",
          "The 30 kuna entrance fee is about right - once you have made the 150 kuna round-trip payment for the cable car ticket you appreciate the value! The photos of the old city and the TV news coverage (in English) from the time are interesting. Unless you're really into the history",
          "A very moving experience very sad to see and heart rendering at times ! After seeing this terrible tragedy in videos no on images we never want to bring war to peacetime again ! It was so recent in history too 1995 !",
          "This is a moving reminder of events not too far back in time. Worth a visit and good vaalue for money",
          "Well worth A visit don't miss it . A real reminder of our recent history told in real life terms and in such a stunning building",
          "On top of mount Srd, next to the cable car station, the museum shows with informative panels and photographs the struggle endured by Dubrovnik under the extensive shelling in the 90s war. It is pretty incredible to see the extent of the damage at the time and how well has the",
          "This place has the feeling of a museum run on a shoestring budget. It's got plenty to communicate but some of this becomes confusing in translation. It's also a shame that some of the narrative boards are suffering from mould due to the leaks in the fort. However the exhibits",
          "Tucked away behind the cable car at the top of Red Hill is a museum commemorating all those who fought on the war of independence 1991. It is very damp with lots of water dropping down from above. Not expensive, video news footage in English, I think in Dubrovnik Old Town there",
          "This is not only a beautiful piece of history dating back to the Napoleonic era. But also an inspiration to all of the bravery the young men and woman showed defending this strategic position. It\u2019s a lovely walk from the Old town to the top along the old donkey track which is",
          "This museum is far more extensive than the display in the Sponza Palace. It gives much detail about the siege of Dubrovnik in 1991-2, of which we were unaware. The video of the bombing and shelling that came from land, sea, and air was all too real. It is very well documented",
          "This had not been on our list of things to see as the cable car was closed due to high winds. However our taxi driver offered to take us here and I am glad we agreed. Not only does this museum give a great insight into the Croatian war, it is housed in an old Napoleonic fortress",
          "It\u2019s both fascinating and terrible that this beautiful city was a warzone just a couple of decades ago. Located in the sturdy structures of the historic Fort Imperial on top of Mount Sr\u0111, the museum\u2019s somewhat hidden behind the cable car station and the lookout. We visited",
          "This is a great Museum, very interesting and informative. Situated at the top of Mount Srd, it can be accessed either via the cable car or simply walk up (or back down again), the choice is yours. This Museum though takes time and effort to focus on properly. It documents as",
          "First of all, the location of this museum is crazy...at the top of Mt. Srd. I would suggest to any able bodied person the walk up, it is gorgeous and not too long or difficult (but be sure to wear walking shoes as it is a gravel walk way with some loose stones). The museum",
          "I had taken the cable car up to the top of the hill and decided to look around the museum in the fort at the top. It was an exhibition of the war in Dubrovnik between 1991-1995. There was lots of information given through,pictures and photographs and also footage shown from",
          "We initially took the cable car up to the top of the hill to see the views over Dubrovnik and went to the museum because we were up there without knowing too much about the history of Dubrovnik. Having only been a toddler at the time of the war I was unaware of what had really",
          "As an American I saw bits of the war on tv in the early 90's, but to see the devastation of what is now a thriving walled city is mind blowing. Businesses bombed or burned out, no power for the residents, and the number of casualties is staggering.",
          "If you buy tickets for the cable car get tickets for this museum as well. Its very interesting and has lots of information and videos about the war.",
          "Not being a history buff I found it really interesting. It shows the reality of the seige of Dubrovnik which, although I had heard about it, hadn't really understood.",
          "If you are interested in learning more about how the 1990s conflict and Croatia\u2019s struggle for independence affected this region then definitely come here. It\u2019s on top of the hill so the views are amazing, and you learn a lot about what was going on there not so long ago.",
          "We visited this museum after walking up Mount Srd (far cheaper than the cable car and an enjoyable walk if you can be bothered). The museum is basic but a great way to learn about the war and understand a bit more about the history of the town etc. some of the English",
          "For the best information on this aspect of the Serbo-Croat conflict, there is no better place in Croatia to get a great overview with so many artefacts, pictures, and movies of the siege of Dubrovnik by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA). Though, take it with a pinch of salt, as",
          "This museum explains the war from the point of view of the citizens of Dubrovnik during the siege as well as telling the military story.",
          "This museum focuses on Dubrovnik during the civil war, it is located in the fort at the top of the cable cars and is not really sign posted that well so could be easily missed, only couple of Kuna entry. There is quite a lot of information to take in, but if you have the time",
          "The museum contains artefacts and panels providing information on the civil war in 1992 - 93 around Dubrovnik. It is well laid out and takes the visitor on a step by step tour through the sequence of events leading up to, during and after the fighting. There is also information",
          "We almost missed this place - we just had basic cable car tickets - as it doesn't appear to have any \"advertising\" outside. It is located in the old fort at the top and to the left of the cable car exit, but if you don't know it's there there are no large signs saying \"museum\"!",
          "A very worthwhile visit where the war of independence is explained through artefacts photos and videos highly recommend a visit.",
          "We included the tour in the ticket for the cable car. The museum is a short walk from the cable station, but was well worth the time. The fort is organized with well labeled photos and artifacts that tell the history of the Croatian War. We found the destruction done to the",
          "If you take the cable car up make sure your ticket includes the museum at the top. The museum covers the wars in the Balkan area in 1991 and in particular how this affected the town of Dubrovnik. Lots of displays (with English) and videos all within the old fort.",
          "The fort was built ny Napolean and still standing. Used to defend the city in the 1990 it is well beaten up, no oil painting but still standing and the exhibitions are excellent. Well worth a visit",
          "This exhibition is one not to be missed. If you were unsure of the detail at the start of the visit, it leaves you in no doubt by the end. Great.",
          "It is hard to imagine Dubrovnik being shelled during the Balkans War but the photographs and video I the museum describe the event in detail. We went up in the cable car and nearly missed the museum. So glad we didn't as it is well worth the minimal entrance fee. Do climb the",
          "This museum tells the story of the Siege of Dubrovnik during the Yugoslav wars. It is a Croatian museum telling a Croatian story and whilst it presents the story of the siege of Mount Sr\u00f0 in detail, visitors will need to be au fait with the context of the Yugoslav wars to fully",
          "Until i visited the Museum i thought that the Old City had not had much damage done to it during the war It is amazing what has been achieved in restoring all the damage that was done There is a great video in english from ITN news and actual footage of strikes Some great",
          "Mementos, literature, newsreels and films give a good background to the bombardment. Well worth the visit",
          "The museum is in Fort Imperial at the top of the cable car and is from where the Croatian forces protected the city during the Croatia/Serbia war in the 1990s. Entrance fee is only 30kuna so is not expensive. There are a lot of pictures covering the different sides involved in",
          "The views from the top of the cable car on Mount Srd are great, but the museum itself could have easily been much better. They do a good job of showing the destruction that happened in Dubrovnik via pictures and BBC news reports, but they never really go into the cause of the",
          "If u like history and war then this is the place to go Either by cable car or taxi it's very high up and the roads are very narrow Lots of facts how the war was started how many people were protecting the town Some great pictures and a few videos",
          "We rented a scooter and had great fun negotiating the single lane winding track going up. A lot of other ruins to explore along the way. Or better yet use the staircase and hike it. \"Ain't no hill for a stepper\" as they say in Tennessee lol. Interesting story about Serbia's",
          "We had driven to the summit so it was just 30kn to enter. Yes it would be interesting to have more background on the war, and the English translation isn't perfect but the jist is obvious. Noone expected Dubrovnik to be attacked as it is a UNESCO site. They were unprepared",
          "The museum has a lot of information to take in. I enjoyed it but found the 'story boards' a bit heavy going word wise, I think it could have flowed a little better. However, it provided a good insight in to this horrible war and what the people of Croatia were put through. The",
          "We were definitely looking forward to learning more about the war. Unfortunately, this museum is very poorly presented. The text accompanying the many photographs is poorly written, making it difficult to really understand what happened, and the videos on display seem to be",
          "you should visit this museum to see what sick people can do...history...how we built our country. What chetniks/idiots from Serbia and Montenegro did to the innocent people...",
          "Mostly a photo essay of the war. There is one video loop playing. The location of the museum and setting of the museum is really cool. I would have preferred more in depth coverage of the war with the exhibits. I feel like it just scratched the surface.",
          "The most interesting thing to do in Dubrovnik. Fascinating history of the war and the bombing of the city. Not to be missed.",
          "Our group visit the Museum and after the tour we been deaply touch and we all agried about strong impact we got from that place where we learned a lot.....",
          "The fortress itself is a relic of Napoleon's time. It now houses a museum on Croatia's war of independence and especially the siege of Dubrovnik during that war, when the fortress was apparently a key point for the defenders of the city. It is obviously a bit of a nationalist",
          "We visited this museum as we had got the cable car. You can buy a combined cable car and museum ticket. The museum isn't huge, but it contains a lot of in depth information about Dubrovnik's history. There are lots of information boards, written in Croatian and English, that",
          "Very moving experience,be advised that there are stairs to go up on the top of the museum.Very shocking photos. Good value,as you can stay as long as you want, no charge for children",
          "The museum is in an old fort above Dubrovnik. You can buy a ticket in combination with the Cable Car which is cheaper than buying separately. The displays are carefully laid out in Croatian and English ( a few corrections are needed) and give a comprehensive account of the siege",
          "This museum's location in the actual fort above Dubrovnik that defended the city during the siege lends it an unmissable aura of authenticity and importance. The displays are very well laid out, with many many photos, captioned in English and Croatian, as well as videos playing",
          "The exhibition was very informative and well laid out. The bullet holes in the walls of the fort are still visible when you go up the stairs and the view from the top is stunning. The pictures exhibited really show the hellish fear and anguish that was going on less than 30",
          "Located a few minutes stroll from the Cable Car station, the museum is housed in Fort Imperial. Entry was 30 for an adult. The exhibit is in English, as well as Croatian. There's several rooms, with the museum split into the escalation, the war, and the aftermath. There's also",
          "When you go up in the cable car please go and see this exhibition. the fact that the building is a Napoleonic Fort is enough but the exhibition in side is very good.",
          "This museum was an amazing insight into the history and tragic war that occurred in Dubrovnik. The information provided within the museum was very insightful and helped inform me of what happened during the war. Not only the photographs during the war, but also the shells,",
          "The war of independence is still fresh in the minds of many of the people. This museum at the top if the cable car is inside the imperial fort originally built by Napoleons men. It was bombed by the recent war and you can see the impact. The story line of the history of the war",
          "I had no idea this museum was here until someone told me about it. But it's worth the trip up the cable car to see it. It tells all about the history of the war from 1991-1995 and what had happened. It's great information for any history buff. I learned so much I hadn't known.",
          "The museum is found right at the top of the mountain, use the cable car to access it. We had no idea it was there and stumbled upon it by accident. The Dubrovnik card does not include it. Entrance was 30HR per person, which we felt was more than worth it. The museum is not that",
          "This is well worth a visit and to be honest a must do if visiting Dubrovnik as it depicts their war of 1991 and the suffering their residents had to endure under siege in modern times.",
          "We came across this very informative exhibition at the top of the cable car ride (Mount Srd). It is packed with information covering the Homeland War with many exhibits, recordings, weapons, stories, documents, maps, photos etc. on display. Take the stairs by the entrance for a",
          "A reminder of the horrors and suffering of civilians. Only a small exhibition, but sufficient to shock you into realising how the innocent are the real victims.",
          "Impressive location which helps to tell the story of the homeland war. Very moving. Lots of information in english and croatian - some of which is in croatian only but is duplicated in english elsewhere. To the left of the corridor is english news footage and to the right is",
          "Take the cable car to the top of My Srd and visit the war museum. When you have seen the devastation the war caused go back down to the city and you will look at it with different eyes.Those people who rebuilt the city to the beautiful place it is today did it with love .I",
          "Located near the top of the cable car route, the Museum of Croatian War of Independence is generally a small but decent museum. The museum focuses mainly on Dubrovniks role in the war and not the war itself, also quite a few rooms have text in Croatian only and not English.",
          "This well-done museum gave an excellent understanding of the war as it affected Dubrovnik. The exhibits and film helped me understand it in a way I never did at the time. Having been in the city for a few days and understanding the places in the pictures made it very real. I",
          "Wow! This is a very detailed museum. There is so much information that I didn't know about. I really enjoyed looking around. However, be sure you give yourself LOTS of time for this museum. Also, since you most likely got to this place on the cable car, make sure you go to the",
          "I thought there were lots of information on offer here, all in Croatian and English as well as videos. You can climb onto the roof which gives better views of Dubrovnik that the cable car observation point for two reasons- 1. Few other tourists 2. You can see further round the",
          "Neat museum to visit when you take the cable car up. The building itself us an old fort and really cool; great photographs of the war history. While we certainly appreciated the English translations, they could use an update - some were difficult to understand so I left feeling",
          "Really brings home a lot of things. 1-It's only 26 years since the war(a lot of the black and white images make it look more like WW2) -And therefore how long Europe has been changed 2-How sympathetically the people of dubrovnik have restored their city (having walked about here",
          "If you take the cable car from Dubrovnik just for the view then you have missed the real treat at the top, that being the war museum in the Old Fort Srd. To think that the conflict nearly destroyed the Old Town and not that many years ago either. While most cable car customers",
          "Worth a visit puts in context what the city has been through and how it values its peace and old buildings as there protection in a modern age, has commemorative book to sign nice view from upstairs and news footage of the time various pictures documents the walk up to steep in",
          "The fort museum is worth a visit, but....We enjoyed the views from the cable car and hill top, followed by lunch in the Panorama restaurant. Lovely cool breeze after the heat of the old town. Then we went in the fort museum, with some explanations in English. We found a film",
          "An eye opener for anyone not aware of the recent history of Croatia. Considering the battering it has received they have done tremendously to bounce back. The museum is on the hill of the cable car. and a much better experience by a mile.",
          "If you make it to the top of Mt. Srd, then you might as well spend the 30 kn to go into the Fort. We were there as it opened at 8am. Walked through several rooms that have pictures, weapons, and other artifacts on display. Although some is in English, much of it is in Croatian.",
          "Excellent representation of the 1991 Balkan War with ITN reports bringing home the conflict in this troubled region ! Walk up the steps to the top and the views are better than from the cable car station.",
          "A place to show old war relics but most of the descriptions are not in english. However, the view at the top is good for photo taking",
          "Not the best museum but clearly one that has significant meaning for the people of Dubrovnik who lived through the War of Independence. If you are hoping to learn about why it happened, then you will be disappointed. What you get is an opportunity to share the grief and",
          "Located at the top of the cable car, the musuem is dedicated to the defenders of Dubrovnik.. Set in the hill top fort, the museum mainly consists of story boards of the timescale of the wars.. Nicely done, and very informative, but such a lot to read in the many galleries. There",
          "Good information regarding the 1991 war in English and Croation. Easy access from Cable car or you can walk the switch back path to the fort.",
          "130Kn cable car and then 30Kn entry, the museum is small and is set it the old fort. The museum is essentially just photos on walls and a few war relics (weapons). It doesn't explain the war very well and is mostly in Croatian. You are better off spending 20-30 mins watching",
          "I found the exhibits hard to follow and understand. But if you take the Cable Car up to the top of Mount Srd, it is still worth a quick visit to look at the pictures and become informed about the war.",
          "Tells the story and could videos in English and Croatian. Hard to appreciate the struggle until you've been here. Only 30 Kuna each. The view from the top floor gives you an idea of the strategic importance and why it was necessary to keep hold of it.",
          "In order to understand the war 1991-1995 and to appreciate the suffering brought about to the Yugoslav population you have to go to this exhibition. It really does make you realise how much Dubrovnik in particular has been regenerated since that time to become this fabulous",
          "LIFE LIKE, REAL TIME VIDEOS! We sat through the videos more than once. Modern warfare was no match for the ancient walls prepared for a sea attack with bows and arrows. Pummel the Old City of Dubrovnik to demoralize the people! Walk the old wall and celebrate the rebuild with",
          "Easily reached either by cable car or by taxi or by 17 bus, very moving exhibition which brings home how the people of Dubrovnik suffered and how resilient they are",
          "Give yourself an hour to go through this museum in combination with lunch at Panorama on top of Srd (cable car). Note: One side of museum is all in English. Excellent film of the fighting in Dubrovnik during the War of the Homeland.",
          "Life changes in a flash but the people who fought in the war are still with us and one of the heroes in this museum was our driver. He didn't speak about his time except to say he fought and was wounded but it drew us in to read about the people with more care.",
          "This was definitely the most interesting museum we've seen in Croatia. It was very informational and particularly interesting, because it's located in a fort that was very significant to the war as well.",
          "This is museum which describes a part of Croatian history, and devastating war 91\"-95\" in which Croatia won freedom. View from the fort is must see attraction!",
          "I was looking forward to visiting the museum but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. On the whole I felt the museum didn't flow very well but I did find the photos and videos informative and interesting. I found the War Photo museum much more interesting.",
          "This museum is located in Fort Imperial and the fort itself is worth a visit. Entry is quite affordable (30 kunas, I think) and there is lots to see, including an English film.",
          "Great little museum, the photos and tv bring to life the horrors of war. I remember watching on tv at home about the war, and its not really that long ago. Very cheap entrance price and good information inside the museum both in English and Croat, worth a visit",
          "There are many rooms featuring different information about the war. There is English on most of the displays, There is a video that shows you some of the effects in Dubrovnik.",
          "interesting place to visit, hard to believe that this happened so recently so I am sure it is very raw for many people. sad, touching photos certainly work a visit.",
          "The entrance fee was a very reasonable 30KN per person. It was v interesting but definitely showed a certain slant to the war. Make sure you climb to the top of the fort as the views were something else",
          "Amazing location (next to the cable car station atop the mountain) in a Napoleonic fortress utilized during the war. The roof offers stunning views of the Old City and the sea. The exhibit was a little hard to follow, but the video offered detailed information on the conflict.",
          "I learned a lot about the break up of Yugoslavia from Croatia perspective in this museum. Very interesting, plenty to see and it costs very little.",
          "Learnt a lot about the impact of the recent war on Dubrovnik and its inhabitants. Moving and well presented.Thought provoking.",
          "Napoleonic fortress that was defended in the Homeland War early 1990's. A thought provoking exhibition brings home the brutality of the bombardment of the Old City which was a place of sanctuary for those vulnerable civilians who had lost their homes in this war and had",
          "30kuna for adults and 15 for students. Only takes about 45 mins to go round. Agree with other visitors that the layout isn't great. The video footage from ITN news at the time brings it to life. We visited early on our stay and it made us really appreciate what the people of",
          "The museum is good I guess because it's a recent war but I found it too detailed to really understand completely. Someone interested in war history would find it really fascinating. Do walk up to the top though - the view is amazing.",
          "All too often folk go up the cable car, take photos of the old city of Dubrovnik, and go back down, without going round the back of the new cable car facility, and so miss out on this historic fort. DON'T MISS IT! The display is well arranged in the bowels of this old",
          "Situated at the top of the cable car in the ld Napoleonic fort. Site of a 'famous' stand against the Jugoslavian forces in the 'War of Independence' following the break up of the communist state.",
          "If you know very little about the 'Homeland War' 1991-1995 then this tells you all you need to know , the Croatians managed to hold on to this fort and all the battle scars are there to see . There are lots of photos and paintings but the best thing is the film that plays the tv",
          "we had to take a taxi here as the cablecar was not running but it was so worth it, a very poignant museum which shows how futile war is, some good photos and displays and a tv presentation which brings it home to you.",
          "We came here by taxi, it was raining so hard the cable car wasn't running, and the first thing to do if you do arrive in a taxi, is to get the driver's number, so you can ring him to pick you up again!!! (It's far to far to walk!) We were driven here by Robert, who actually",
          "Came here as when you go up the cable car there isn't much to do except a buggy safari, eat, admire the view or go back down. It is interesting enough as it is a war in my lifetime. Once past the entrance on the left is English with the ITN news playing in the background",
          "With the general atmosphere in Dubrovnik being very cool and relaxed and the surroundings so achingly beautiful, it is easy to forget the city's recent history. This museum provides a detailed account of the 1991-95 conflict and I found it quite harrowing at times. There are",
          "A collection of photos, videos and artefacts which go a long way to informing you about the terrible war when Dubrovnik was attacked not too many years back. The building housing the display also played an important role.",
          "If you are interestet in the history of Dubrovnik then there is also the newer and eye opening history. So if you have decided to take the cable car you should also visit this museum. Price 30 kn. Worth the price and don't bring your small kids.",
          "A short wander from the cable car and you find the well worn fort. Of very solid French design ....it has wweathered time and the recent conflict in 1991. Wander around and read the signage but take the time to watch the Uk TV coverage in the video room. Makes one wonder how",
          "This museum is tucked away in the fort behind the cable car building - but it's absolutely worth finding. This is the fort from which Croatians defended Dubrovnik during the Homeland War and wandering through it while you learn about the conflict and the devastation makes the",
          "This is atvtge top of the cable car ride. We had a combined ticket to get there and back on the cable car and visit this museum. The entry is about 4 quid which is actually not bad but the content was limited to just the attack on Dubrovnik itself and did not really expand to",
          "It's a shame they haven't organised it better. They should have an overall intro to the conflicts, in an easier digestible way. They should have a time line too. 30 min video sound was awful, please invest in decent speakers. It was essentially ITN news at 10 items. Could do",
          "The war is very important to remember as it is only a few short years ago and reminds us that we are still war mongers at heart and that bad people will always try to force their way on you because they want to control you. The museum is very good and reminds us of the bad times.",
          "We visited this museum having read the reviews on trip advisor. We arrived by taxi, the driver offered to take us there and wait before taking us for a mini tour of Dubrovnik. This was much cheaper than booking the car and driver from the hotel. It was very moving reading the",
          "Such a waste of so many young lives is a sad reminder of the consequences of war but a tribute to the patriotism of those same men.",
          "Worth seeing to get some context of Croatia and Dubrovnik, but quite harrowing and made me sad ,images of wasted young life very graphic",
          "My partner and I came here after the cable car ride. We weren't hungry so decided to not do the restaurant and this museum was the one of the other options. (I personally didn't fancy the buggy tour) We were both glad that we went to this museum. It offered at lot of history",
          "Bombarded from land sea and air in 1991 . Indiscriminate damage . You learn quickly how a peaceful city can suddenly find itself caught up in a conflict that had nothing to do with it. And as a result its inhabitants and defenders found themselves ill equipped and trapped. We",
          "Very impressive displays over a large area. My husband and I spent considerable time looking around and viewing some of the videos too. The museum is open long hours, we arrived around 5pm Saturday night and were surprised that it was open until 10pm!",
          "Emotionally stirring displays of war in recent history. An hour is probably long enough for a visit. Make sure you head to the top of the fort as the views are fantastic. We stayed until sunset and got some great photos.",
          "If you want to learn more on the history of Croatia and its War of Independence, this is just one of those places you must visit and see.",
          "One of the many \"Must See\" attractions in Dubrovnik. Once you've ridden the cable card to the top of Srd Hill, had a cool drink in the Panorama restaurant and taken your photos of the city from on high, take an hour or two and visit this simple, yet remarkable museum situated on",
          "You can take the cable car to the top of the hill and enjoy the great view over the old town and the rough backcountry. The museum shows the Croatian view of a dark and sad period in modern European history. Just outside the museum a rocky but easy trail leads you back to the",
          "We bought tickets to the museum (4 euros) along with our cable car fare and spent about an hour checking out the exhibits while atop Mount Srd. I was astounded, having never heard of the attack on Dubrovnik in 1991 and subsequent four-year war. I'm one of those people who read",
          "Combine a visit to this museum with a sunset trip up the cable car. The exhibits are clearly one-sided and biased, but based on what I've read, the side they present (Croatian) is a valid perspective.",
          "When we arrived at the top of Mount Srd we headed for the Museum after reading reviews. It is very sad but how they have arranged the exhibition is excellent and very educational. The ticket you receive is actually a postcard which you can bring away as a souvenir.",
          "We took the cable car from old town Dubrovnik and decided to enrich the views from the hill with a cultural visit of the fort built by Napoleon and encompassing the ind\u00e9pendance war Museum. It is strange to be reminded this war was so close in Europe (1991-1995). The fort is",
          "We were young adults during the Balkans conflict and couldn't really remember much about it. This museum describes it in a series of photos, maps, and old news footage. It's really informative although is completely from the Croatian perspective so may not be completely",
          "The museum is within the walls of the hilltop fortress from which the Croatian heros withstood battery from the Serbian and Montenegran troops 25 years ago. It is mostly recounted in photos with some weaponry and ammunitions - best bit is probably the film that recounts the",
          "When you reach the top station of the cable car and if you've looked at the views, go into this exhibition in Fort Imperial - it is an eye opener! There are photographs, film and video and exhibits of shells, etc. all laid out very well inside the old fort. It is hard to believe",
          "The videos were good, the photos were emotional, but the write ups in English were not clear enough. Also difficult to know much about the background to the start of the wars.",
          "Stopped by here when we took the cable car up above Dubrovnik. The photos give a good sense of what it must have been like during the war. Interesting that Dubrovnik was the target of bombing given its heritage. I would highly recommend stopping here and viewing the photos.",
          "Perched high above the Old City and readily reached by the cable-car (buy a combined ticket for the cable car and the Fort), this Napoleonic Fort tells the harrowing tale of Dubrovnik through the 1990\u2019s war of independence. The exposition is extensive: remember to leave some",
          "Dubrovnik is all about history and this museum is dedicated to the most recent conflict in Dubrovnik's history. We were married in 1991 and were based in Denver, Colorado at the time whilst the gulf war was raging. We returned to the UK as the Balkan conflict had started which",
          "A real must do, well structured. All the more thought provoking for being actually in the fort that was shelled. Photos and videos very powerful. Unashamedly told from the Croatian viewpoint with the Serbs not spared through any misguided attempt at \"balance\" . The story is",
          "The portrait photos of men at war tug at your heart strings with expressions varying from despair to euphoria.",
          "This museum is set at the top of Mount Srd and has a commanding position overlooking Dubrovnik. It has a series of rooms/arches containing some striking photographs and explanations of the civil war conflict - and especially the significance of why the Croatians had to hold",
          "Very interesting and gave you a good idea of what had happened. The photos were emotive and life like. You got a feel of what took place",
          "Best way up is the cable car, worth it for the views! The museum itself, however, is somehow overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time, and the information appears a bit one-sided. Take it in with a grain of salt.",
          "We found this a very touching reminder of the awful devastation that occurred in the country and were amazed at the reconstruction that has happened since. The signposting to the museum was very poor and we only went there because another holiday maker had told us about it. We",
          "We expected this museum to be so busy but intact it was extremely quiet considering the hundreds of people milling around outside by the cablecars. It I a lovely museum with some brilliant insight into the war from the Croatian perspective. Myself and my partner were not born",
          "A poignant reminder of the war situated in the old Napolionic Fort over looking the Walled City. If you are into history this is a must do.",
          "If you know about the homeland war and want to see some details from the Croation side then this is a good place to visit. I recommend that you read up on the history beforhand. It will help put thinks in perspective.",
          "Lovely peaceful hall with well laid out memorabilia of the war. Touching photos of all those men who lost their lives. Great video of images during the war. Well worth seeing.",
          "It\u2019s located at the top of the mountain, accessible by the Cable Car, and stayed open until 22:00 when we were there (mid-September). The cable car also ran until 22:00. Entrance was very good value \u2013 something like \u00a33.00pp. It\u2019s also actually really big \u2013 much more than it",
          "The place where is the museum is pretty cool, it is a fort built in the time of Napoleon Bonaparte. The exhibition itself , for those who do not know the history of the War of Independence ends up being a little frustrating program as it comes in quite local details related to",
          "We visited this museum as part of our trip on the cable car. It is extremely well set out and presented. We learnt so much about the Croatian conflict. You actually spend hours in here.",
          "Visited during our cable car trip and found this not only to be the best value museum, but also the most informative and interesting. A must see in my opinion.",
          "This museum has many videos and pictures of how bad it really was. As an American who was a young adult at the time, I had no idea. It is disgraceful what the Serbs did to Dubrovnik and its people.",
          "A good way of understanding what it was like in Dubrovnik during the war of the 1990s. Very cheap entry but lots of photos and exhibits as well as video film",
          "Located at the top of the cable cars. A welcome break from the baking heat! If you like war museums then do visit here. Some very moving photography.",
          "We didn't plan this visit but glad we went! Learned a lot more from the Croatian point-of-view. The building is pretty shabby, but it's part of the experience. We bought our ticket jointly with cable car. Took us between 30-45 minutes because we sat and watched the videos.",
          "We took the cable car for the views, but spent more time looking at this exhibit. It is based in the fort where the Croatian soldiers defended Dubrovnik. Of course, it is just from one perspective, but highlights just how disorganized the defence of Croatia was and how well they",
          "This was one of my highlights in Dubrovnik. Very interesting museum telling the story of the Croatian War of Independence and in particular the attack on Dubrovnik, which is covered by a short video with a series of ITN news reports from the time. Whilst the people of Dubrovnik",
          "Don't forget buy your day ticket to enjoy the walls and lots of museums etc worth a visit . well kept too",
          "Museum is at the top of the mountain and you can get there by cable car (highly recommended). It is has exhibitions on the war in Croatia from the '90s and the attack on Dubrovnik and even though it only tells one side of the story for the former Yugoslavia was from the Croatian",
          "it's important that visitors to this beautiful city have a better feel for its history - and especially its recent, tumultuous history - and this is the place to learn about it. I certainly have a far better feel for the recent wars in this part of the world following my visit",
          "Set within a Napoleonic fort, which was used by the defenders of Dubrovnik, this museum left us with a profound feeling of loss. We had spent some time up to this visit, exploring the immediate area which only heightened the senses as to what the locals went through not so long",
          "Terribly moving museum and exhibition. Wonderful views of Dubrovnik and the mountains behind the fort. Nice walk down Mount Srd, but wear good shoes and don't attempt if infirm in any way.",
          "If you go on the cable car, visit the Homeland war museum in the old fort at the top. Look for the signs on the wall in the carpark.",
          "Housed in an old Napoleonic fort tucked behind the cable car station is an exhibit highlighting the conflict in Croatia 1991-1995. In the US we never really heard about this conflict Although we were aware of the coinciding Bosnian conflict and break up of Yugoslavia in a",
          "We took a trip up Mount Srd not realising that this museum was there. It is a very haunting experience. Most visitors have little knowledge of this \"localised war\" apart from what was on our televisions at home. The pictures and stories behind them was interesting. The downside",
          "you can feel the importance of the location when looking down on the city and understand why they fought so hard to retain it. The newsreel brings back the memories of the fighting and reminded us of what a short time it was since the war happened.",
          "Unfortunately this exhibition highlights the worst of egos and humanity against each other. It depicts not only the attempt by Serbia and Montenegro to take over Croatia but the battle for Dubrovnik between 1991 and 1995. It consist of lots of boards and pictures to explain the",
          "We spend an hour at the museum, shocking to see what happened so recently that the people we were meeting and talking to in the town had been so badly impacted. Agree with another reviewer that it was one sided, but that is what I would expect. Bit of a reality check when",
          "Costs next to nothing and great to get a better understanding of a war that only happened 25 years ago. The day before we visited we had a tour to Montenegro with a guide who lived through it so this added to our understanding of the war. The museum is located in the fort that",
          "The majority of the exhibits in this museum are photographs with very brief captions. There are some guns, ammunition and shells too. There are several halls with one common theme each: suffering of the civilian population, photos of the Croatian soldiers, etc. The photos are",
          "we didnt know about the museum but were encouraged to visit by our host who we had an interesting talk with when we returned to our guest house.I found the war photos taken by Pavo Urban particulary poignant",
          "A thoughtfully organised museum containing all the information needed to understand what actually happened. It felt strange to watch the original news coverage shown on TV at the time relating to a city you are in. There are detailed maps outlining how the conflict expanded",
          "The museum only costs 30 Kuna to enter which is very good given the large amount of material inside. There is a lot of information, and possibly too much to take in, but it offers an in-depth explanation of the war and is very eye-opening if you knew little about it prior to the",
          "Text heavy exhibits with a poor English translation made some parts of the narrative hard to follow which was a great shame. I thought the video and the photography sections were very good.",
          "You can get the cable car to the tip of Mount Srd or, if there's a few of you, one of the local taxis will take you there reasonably cheaply if you negotiate. The museum is basic but is housed in the cool vaults of this Napoleonic fort so its an ideal escape from the heat. The",
          "This museum covers a very interesting part of relatively recent european history. Unfortunately, for us it was a bit \"all or nothing\", meaning that you either have to read all posters, or more browse through. To read all would be too much, and also it was a bit too \"local\" and",
          "We visited this museum in the old Napoleonic fort at the top of mount Srdj reached by the cable car. It is an extremely interesting and thought provoking place. The siege of Dubrovnik in 91/92 is explained by a number of poster displays with text and related photos. These are",
          "We visited this museum after taking the cable car, a huge feat for someone who doesn't do heights!!! All of the facilities concerned with the cable car are excellent, including the best Iced Coffee in Dubrovnik! All of these were surpassed by the Homeland Museum. Even though it",
          "This museum gives a touching impression of what happened during the homeland war. Photos, videos, maps, weapons, you can see it all. And it's specified to the Dubrovnik area and the Mount Sr\u0111. The contrast between visiting the Old Town, swimming, sunbathing etc, and than getting",
          "A fantastic place to visit at the top of Mount Srd, a moving account of what happened in 1991, worth visiting if you are in Dubrovnik as it is a harrowing tale of what happened to the locals. It is only 30 kunas to enter and has lots of information and photographs of people",
          "Worth a visit, when you have had enough of the great views from the cable car. Cheap admission, local account of the Homeland war, which was fought on the land surrounding the museum",
          "We saw models of ships, weapons etc that were used in the war. The tickets are bit expensive for such activities. We managed to buy tickets under student pass. It was only 30 Kunas for student pass, otherwise one need to pay 100 kunas per person.",
          "we took the cable car to the top of the mountain and were moved by this excellently set out explanation of the siege of Dubrovnik",
          "A lot of information to take in, but the photography & film footage on display gets the message across of what the citizens of Dubrovnik endured. Feels more real, as you are actually in a building that played it's part in the defence of the city. It is also amazing to see how",
          "The museum is at the top of Mount Srd and there is little signposting to it before hand but is a definite must see. The building is an old Napoleonic fortress. The museum is very informative and interesting detailing the Croatian war of independence and I would definitely",
          "Great museum, with a understanding of the Croatian war of independence, very well set out , two minutes walk from the cable car with great views.",
          "Obviously the War of Independence in the 1990's was very important to them and they are keen to share their experiences lest we forget. It was difficult to have a constant veiled criticism that we stood by and watched which certainly wasn't my impression from home. Many",
          "Full of history and very thought providing. It is a showcase of what this country has been through. Also great views from the roof/ top.",
          "Man's inhumanity to man never ceases to amaze, but for those over the age of 25 a visit to the old Imperial Fort with its displays of memorabilia from the Homeland War of 1991-5 is a lesson in living history and a reminder that war is that close to all of us and not just on the",
          "We decided to visit this as both my husband and I are old enough to remember this war well and our children (10 and 13) are old enough to appreciate that wars don't just happen hundreds of years ago. The photos and news reels bought it alive for them, especially when we said",
          "This gives lots of really interesting information about what happened both in and to Dubrovnik during the war, and how this was a key part of the defence of the city. It is very much told from that perspective, but that's not really surprising, so don't think it should be",
          "The pictures were impressive. The details of the captions were too much for me. They also present a very biased perspective of the war. Well, may be that's to be expected in a war museum.",
          "The museum is easily reached from the top of the cable car and is housed within the fort Napoleon ordered for the defence of Dubrovnik. All around are reminders of the atrocities of the 90's war including the rebuilt communications tower and the bullet holes. The exhibition",
          "I liked the exhibition a lot, being fully aware of its propaganda purpose. As I come from the region, I know a lot about the breakup of our common country of Yugoslavia. The story told by the photos in the museum is not the whole story, because it is told from the winner's",
          "Reminds us of the collective embarrassment of the international community to what happened during 1991-95.",
          "As with all war it is tragic, this was more so as it was recent in historic terms. A picture says a thousand words, it did here.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are taking the cable car to the top of the mountain. The museum is a must see as it is a moving history of the Croatian War of Independence, the hardship experienced by the citizens of Dubrovnik, and the brave people who survived the terrible",
          "A reminder of the recent history of this marvellous country and the fight it had to gain it's Independence. The photos and video bring home the suffering of war on the young and old plus the heroic defence of Dubrovnik.",
          "Prior to visiting Dubrovnik I had no idea of the war between Croatia & Yugoslavia. But after visiting the museum I learnt some much about their battle to remain interdependent. An amazing story, one that shouldn't be forgotten. The local's & cab drivers love to talk about the",
          "We went after using cable car. The displays a very good, but hard to follow as the translations are a bit \"off\", but I would recommend this to give people the insight into Dubrovnik's history in the last 25 years!",
          "The museum takes you through the dreadful period of the \"homeland\" war with powerful photographs and maps showing where the damage had been done. Outside on the hillside remains of fortifications and trenches are clear to see. Well worth a visit.",
          "Such a moving and well done museum. Our children were so small when the war happened and they were uneducated about it. They really appreciated learning about it. The video there really brought the experience of the people there to life. We had a private guide that day and",
          "This museum shows Dubrovnik during the war in 1991. The photos and videos illustrate the struggle the Croatians had to cope with during the defence of the Old Town. The museum building is the fort the Croatian Forces used during the battle and it have an eerie feel of distant",

          "Pictures and artifacts of war are always sad and touching and this is no different. Worth a visit to appreciate what war brings to innocent people",
          "A very interesting museum about the fairly recent war with Serbia. I know it is told from a local perspective but is frightening that see news at the time but unfortunately put them to back of our minds until we are reminded of the horrors of war . Good ITV newsreels with lots",
          "I recommend touring this museum after you've had a chance to walk around old town, Dubrovnik. Watching the video and looking at photos of the bombed buildings and streets where you've recently tread makes the history more real. Thought-provoking historical archive on Croatia's",
          "Really reasonably priced to get in. Brings things home about the events that took place in my lifetime!!!",
          "It is hard to think that this appalling conflict happened in our lifetime and on our doorstep. The TV footage steps you back into the early 90's as if it was yesterday. As expected the information is only from Croatia's perspective but highlights the dark times this city and",
          "This museum is based in Fort Imperial, a key place in the action of the Croatian war of independence and creates a sense of the grim reality of war. It is focused primarily on the battles and their build up with some artefacts of the war including examples of weapons. The most",

          "Just a short walk from the cable car drop off is this museum. It is informative & well laid-out. You really get an appreciation of what the locals endured during the shelling and battles around Dubrovnik in the early 1990's. Modest entrance fee.",
          "It is a must see if you have come all the way to mount srd by cable car or walk/car. But no need to come here just for the museum. The museum offers the croatian version of the so called homeland war, mainly fought between the Serbs and the Croats. The descriptions are",
          "The story of the siege of Dubrovnik told in a number of story boards and videos. Located in the old Napoleonic fort the building has been largely kept as it was during the defence of the city by the Dubrovnik defence force. Whilst clearly told from the Croatian point of view",
          "Well worth the time and small admission fee. It will be great when they can find a permanent home for this collection.",
          "At the top of the Cable car stop is the Homeland War memorial. Remember to buy your tickets when you get on the cable car to save time. Tickets can be purchased at the entrance as well. Now sad and complicated is the history of Croatia and Dubrovnik!! Why must books and",
          "This exhibit provides a good view of the suffering endured during the war. My wife and I were here in our last visit to Dubrovnik and wanted to bring our son and grandson.",
          "Very moving and humbling. We admire the people for rebuilding their beautiful city in such a short space of time.",
          "Very sobering of how the Croatians fought for their homeland just a little over 20 years ago. Amazing on how much was destroyed and today it is very difficult to see the damage the war created.",
          "Inside the old fort there are various rooms with displays of weapons, photographs and video. Make sure you go up to the roof where you get fantastic views.",
          "This exhibition clearly shows that peace is the greatest treasure we have. May it all not happen again.",
          "The building was very cool and the price was good, however we were somewhat disappointed by the museum. It was very sobering to read about the war and what the Croatian people went through. The first gallery provides a lot of information (in not so great English - which is",

          "Few people seem to visit this, they tend to just look at the views from the top of the mountain. The building is in a RAW state which adds to the understanding of the tragedy of the war and to the determination of a handful of people to defend their homes. Very Moving. A lot of",
          "It's hard to believe the \"Homeland War\" as Croatians call it took place over 20 years ago. This museum has incredible pictures showing what happened during that war - the pictures reminded me of WW II. Makes me question what we have learned from previous wars.",
          "This attraction is at the top of the cable car route. It was very cheap to enter. There was a bunch of information in the exhibit, which I got slightly confused about. There were too many details in the writing for me but anyone who loves history or war will enjoy it. The photos",
          "The Museum is a short walk from the top of the Cable Car. I think it was about 5 euro entrance. Go to the far end on the museum to find the video in English which is very informative. It gives a great overview of the war of 1991-1995.",
          "Don't expect this museum to be like some of the museums in Britain. It is cold, it is damp, it is real. It is a collection of weapons found, photos and film clips taking during and the rebuilding of a city ravaged by war. So many young lives lost, so much damage done to the",
          "A time to get away from all the hustle and bustle and reflect on what happened only 2 decades ago. I grew up knowing about the conflicts throughout the 90's, but being young never understanding fully what was going on. After touring the city and then finding yourself here..it",

          "Drive, walk, or take the cable car up. This museum full of pictures from the war was fascinating and educational. Fabulous views of the city as well.",
          "I spent a good couple of hours in this museum reading and looking at the displays and photographs. This is not an ultra modern facility with digital displays, it's in the basement of a napoleonic fort which has been subjected to modern day small arms fire, artillery bombardment",
          "We went to the museum with a guide not knowing much about the war in 1991, I must add, a little bit ignorant. However, the explanation given and, especially the movie, were so good. It added something more to the understanding of what happened. If readers are interested to",

          "The fortress the museum is housed in is really interesting to view. The video that is on loop showing ITV news footage and reporting from 1991 is very informative about what happened once the war had begun, and there is a lot of detail provided about the various battles during",
          "I'm glad I visited the museum, as it was important to me to \"bear witness\" to the terrible war. However, I have to say that the English translation of the texts beside the photos was very convoluted and difficult to read. The museum would be well served by better translation.",
          "This site is at the top of Mt. Srd near the cable car landing. It really brings to life the terrible war the Croatians endured from 1991-1995.. The cost is only 30 kuna which is worth it if only to help maintain this fort that was instrumental in the war.",
          "The museum is a memory of those who fought to save Dubrovnik both military and volunteers. Lots of details and memories of courage and sacrifice. We climbed to the roof and behold a beautiful clear view of Dubrovnik without cable car wires. Went below to cafe near cable",

          "Worth a visit to understand the war and attack on Dubrovnik and the courage of the inhabitants but there is too much writing which repeats itself.. Probably good for history purists but a little too much for the average visitor. However no doubt about heroism of the Croatians",
          "This is located at the mountain top where the cable car runs. An exhibition showing the war of 1990's which is very interesting and worth the visit",
          "It is so easy to go on holiday to Croatia and to shut your eyes to the evidence of a war that has taken place here not long ago. Two hundred brave men of Dubrovnik died while trying to protect their homes and families and many more were injured and displaced. The touristic areas",
          "Definitely worth a visit for those that remember 1991 as it puts into context the Serbia / Croatia war (which I found confusing at the time).",
          "The Napoleonic fort that houses the museum is historically interesting but in poor state of repair. Several of the rooms showed water damage and the exhibition itself (photos, videos, documents and armaments) is not particularly well laid out. Overall it offers a reasonable",

          "This is a visit where no words can say what it shows about war, the pictures tell more than a thousand words can ever do. I learnt more about what had occurred in this region than I knew, it is an eye opener.",
          "considering this is one of the'paid' sites in the city, a collection of war photos does not make the visit worth it",
          "We took the cable car up to the top of mount Sdj (very well worth doing in itself) to where this museum is situated. A picture says a thousand words and some of these photographs do, the captions are secondary. The video of the ITN news reports of the time really bring home the",
          "This is located in the dingy, old (unkempt) fort on top of the mountain. The views from the top (up the stairs) are truly wonderful, and the content within is interesting (along with good video content). I suppose one does not need to do both this war museum and the War Photo",

          "Educational, interesting and moving, the museum should be a must-see for anyone visiting Croatia. True that it is a bit hard to follow- and does lack some clarity and well designed exhibits, but just being there is almost enough to absorb a small bit of what happened. There is a",
          "I took the cable car up my first day in Dubrovnik and didn't have any time for the actual museum, but the views are amazing and you don't get the cables in the picture. Also its not too expensive. The guy worked the second day, which I hiked up, and was kind enough to let me go",
          "Good to gain some more information on such a recent conflict. The English translations were not great and in some of the rooms and collections non existent. The hike up to the roof for a view of the city is well worth it.",
          "The Croatians are understandably bitter about the bombardment of Dubrovnik in1991-92. It was a UNESCO world heritage site with little strategic benefit, but still the Serbs and Montnegrans attempted to destroy it. This exhibition narrates the offences and how the inhabitants of",
          "For ~\u00a33 you can't really complain, but this museum really lacked context. I don't know much about this war, so a bit of background would have helped before jumping into the specifics of what infantry detachment was where and when! There was a good video which showed where",
          "An exhibition of photographs and weapons from a very recent war. Look at how ordinary everyday life can be shattered. More impactful as I can very well remember what I was up to in the early 90's and most of those killed were roughly the same age as me.",
          "You need to go up cable car to get to this museum or walk up!!! You can buy a combined ticket at cable car station. This is situated in the old fort just behind the cable car complex. It is very interesting with video, dramatic photographs but I felt the explanations were very",
          "A stark reminder of a war that happened recently (in the 90s). The best part is the video that played on repeat in one of the rooms. And, the photos...unreal. Having this museum in a military fort that was actually used during the war makes it even more moving. In the video",
          "Good to get background on this realitively recent war. Close to cable car. Much more damage to Dubrovnik than a person realizes.",
          "This is a very interesting exhibition of the 1990's war, it was well worth visiting. It is situated at the top of the cable car. You don't have to go up in the cable car as there is a road up as well.",
          "A worthwhile visit, if you are interested in the Balkan war. The fort in which the museum is located was the Dubrovnik's key defence point against the attacking Serb and Montenegran forces",
          "The museum housed at the top point of the cable car, in an old building ravaged during previous war with neighbouring countries shows the grit with which Croatians fought the war. The 30 minutes video show is particularly moving and touching.",
          "We took the Cablecar up to the Fort to see the view. Stayed a while; decided to take lunch at the restaurant there. Enjoyed the meal and excellent espresso, then went for a walk. Discovered the Mad Max offroad rides available, then entered the fort. The displays give a detailed",
          "Very interesting as this war didn't happen that long ago! the videos were very clear and they make you more aware of all of the bomb marks which are on the buildings in the old town and how the city has changed in recent years. Well worth a visit!",
          "A very poignant tale, well documented. Highlights the failure of European Union to safeguard civilian population. Good video and chronological order of War. Really worth a visit and a must see if you have come up on the cable car. The same thing is happening in Ukraine today.",
          "If you are at the top anyway then this museum is worth a visit. An essential guide to the damage and devastation of the \"homeland\" war. Be prepared to be a little bit moved by the exhibits as this happened little more than 20 years ago.",
          "Worth seeing if you're up at the cable car. It's included in the ticket and as that's fairly expensive to avoid a walk, it's worth getting value for money. The building is fascinating, but I found the exhibits repetitive and really needed to give more information about the",
          "If you do take a trip in the cable car this little museum is well worth a visit. There are many photos and news reports showing the damage caused by the 1991/2 war.",
          "Viewed this museum with a native Croatian. Very moving experience. The short film is worth the time.",
          "If you have time, just sit there and watch the documentary video that they have and you can learn about what happened during the war that happened 20 years ago. Don't forget to go to the roof of the museum, I think the view is more beautiful than in the cable car",
          "Very informative museum with powerful photos and videos. Educated us about how the Dubrovnik was effected by the war and how the locals worked together to save the old city. The entry fee wasn't much and the staff were friendly. Was interesting as the museum is based in the fort",
          "From the outside it is a world away from the slick redevelopment of the cable car and you feel a little like you are in the middle of a ceasefire - the shell damage from twenty years ago still very evident. The information and pictures show the war very much from the Croatian",
          "A very interesting experience providing a valuable insight to the history of the conflict in 1991. Information available in several languages including English. The news videos are very informative .",
          "Most people go up the mountain just for the view, which is spectacular. But please take a few minutes to see how much the city you are visiting suffered not that long ago.",
          "I thought this museum was very worthwhile. I had just finished reading Misha Glenny's \"The Fall of Yugoslavia\" and to now see in images the impact of the war on a town we had just visited was quite profound. The one hall had a rolling video of ITN news reports from Dubrovnik",
          "Interesting & informative museum, but most wordings on the pictures was in Croatian. It costs around \u00a33 to enter",
          "This museum is well worth visiting as it tells the story of the siege of Dubrovnik, with photos, film and personal effects.",
          "Most interesting, but being a museum of War, not without its sadness and very thought-provoking. It is housed in the fort which in itself gives good views of the old city and the wider geography. Tells the story.",
          "I visited this museum with little understand of the war in Croatia and I learned an awful lot in such a small time. We had to get a cable car up to the museum which was \u20ac10 but the view was fantastic. I think the entrance fee to the museum was about \u20ac3 but it is worth it if you",
          "If you take the cable car ride then it would be a real shame to miss this. It has been preserved rather than renovated so you cant miss the damage the building sustained during the war. Once inside the displays are very intersting and when you explore the photographic section,",
          "This is a must do if you have go up for the view from the cable car. Its is so interesting reading about this war that is only 20 years ago. You do read a lot but its fascinating. Its based in the old fortress so make sure you go to the top and see the view.",
          "Worth a look, although many of the photos are duplicated so you see the same thing from room to room. There are a few artifacts on display (weapons etc.) and some newsreel footage. I found it fascinating and quite poignant as the location really sets the scene and brings to",
          "Well, the stories are interesting but the exhibition is really unstructured. To understand it you have to read a lot, and I mean A LOT! To read the text to all the photos would probably take a couple of hours. We were also missing an overview of the conflict and I can't say that",
          "This is an excellent museum which gives you real perspective about the war through photographs and news footage. It is housed in a Napoleonic fort that was actually the site of fighting during the war. There are amazing views, much better than the views from the cable car",
          "This should be a must see for visitors to Dubrovnik. The museum is informative and well done. You can't help but feel for the survivors and people who lost their lives in this war.",
          "Interesting museum about the war of independece in Croatia during the 1990's. For us who saw this war on TV during that time this was an opportunity to get more detailed information and to get closer to the actual happenings around Dubrovnik. Terrifying to see the video where",
          "The fortress was a combat station for the Croatian defenders. Really touching to see all that. They preserved it really well after the combat.",
          "A moving and informative museum. Does it matter if there are not many English translations? It is enough to see what happened in 1991. Perhaps a combined ticket with the cable car will entice more visitors to this must see venue. Please support it.",
          "Take time and visit this historical place. History of Croatia and its people. located on the top of the mountain next to the cable car, walk a few meters to your left and you will find the building still some remains from their last fight. Great information but also views.",
          "Since you will likely take the cable car up to get stunning views of Dubrovnik, you may as well visit the museum to get an inside into the tragic was of 1991-1995. I am not certain that the museum alone is worthwhile a trip, but most visitors take the cable car for the views and",
          "Anyone visiting Dubrovnik should go to see this museum - it's very moving and will enrich and give much more meaning to your visit. The resilience and determination of the people of Dubrovnik in resisting the appalling aggression to which they were subjected should be an",
          "This was a thought provoking and interesting museum. It tells the 'story' of the war clearly and has photos and artifacts too. A moving place to visit but so interesting to read the recent history and how it has affected the local population. If you go up the cable car it is",
          "This museum is at the top of the hill which overlooks Dubrovnik. Accessed mainly via the cable car. Well worth a visit as it explains the conflict in former Yugoslavia and the creation of the different countries and conflicts. Sad to think that this was just over twenty years",
          "Overall this museum is definitely worth a visit to learn more about the homeland war. We arrived via the cable car and the museum is easy to find and only a short walk away. The building itself is ideal and appropriate for this museum. Crumbly and rather cool inside, it sets",
          "We visited this museum on our trip on the cable car and it was certainly worthwhile to see what actually happened during the conflict.This was built in Napoleonic times and it has stood the test of time and it so full of history and you wonder what life was like at these",
          "We enjoyed the museum. The building was incredible: the atmosphere was crackling with its history. All the description boards were available in English and very informative. However, the exhibits were lacking, there is a limited selection of artillery, a range of photographs",
          "We took the cable car up and bought our museum tickets when we bought our cable car tickets. The museum has lots of information (as noted by other reviewers) but we found the most interesting to be the 20 minute video news clips and footage.",
          "Worth a visit although there is an awful lot of reading. It certainly brings back memories of seeing the war on the news and gives some context to it.",
          "The boards explaining stuff were hard to read. They should really have hired a copywriter. Also not much as to why the war started etc. The photos were good and they had a short video which was clips of ITV news anchor reporting from Dubrovnik which was interesting.",
          "The museum recounted the events of the 1991 war in simple but moving exhibits. The video (BBC news coverage of the siege), narratives, photos and exhibits combine to tell the story behind the war and the sufferings of the people during that time. And what better place to house",
          "This place educated us a lot on the suffering endured by the locals during the civil war. The most interesting part was seeing the destruction caused to the Old Town, as it's been repaired so well that the damage is no longer visible. However we felt that the narrative was",
          "For me,the visit here was the best thing in Dubrovnik.A thought provoking small museum,more of a tribute than a historical exhibit,but I found it fascinating.The fort itself is quite a monument,but to see what it and the old town withstood during the last war,was incredible!",
          "Our (high) expectations were not met. We got no overall oversight what happened in the Croatian war or what events the museum concentrated. The verbal explanations were long and tangled with details of no or lesser interst to a non-Croatian - an editor/copywriter needed to edit",
          "I'm embarrassed to say I know little about the homeland war from the former Yugoslavia, so was interested to visit this museum on our trip to Mt Srd on the cable car. A very humbling experience to see how Dubrovnik was affected and presented in an interesting way, with video and",
          "Easiest way to get to this important exhibition is by cable car from the Old Town and then walk a few yards to the Fort. Well worth a visit, this is a moving record of the struggle by the people of Dubrovnik and shocking, if only for how we in the west forgot what they went",
          "The best part about this museum is that it's within the old fort which played a very important part in the war. The information is very detailed, providing a little too much information on the army than what I could comprehend. I also found the English billboards a little",
          "Hopefully they will use the funds collected for entry fees to work on adding more to this museum. The material is quite dense for the average visitor and does not really attempt to present the information impartially. The best part for us was just being in the Fort, seeing the",
          "Take time, its a small cost as is the entry fee, to try and understand what happened here just 20 yrs ago. The video montage of Paul Davies ITN is a very real reminder of how frightening War is and how ordinary people suffer,but find the courage to stand up and be counted in the",
          "For me, as an ex-military research analyst, it was a very sombre and thought provoking visit to see the results of the futility of war.",
          "Visited to get a better understanding of the 90's war. The place is at the top of mount Srd and consists of 4 rooms with poster information and a TV reel on a constant loop. For me the posters were too detailed and not clear enough but you eventually get an idea of what happened",
          "If it had been the standard Dubrovnik 100Kunas then it would not be worth the money. As others have said it does,as you would expect, tell the story from the Croatian side only but it does that well. it's all rather basic, some signage outside and a decent footpath would not go",
          "This museum is located in the fort overlooking Dubrovnik, next to the cable car. It is worth the 30 kuna entrance fee. Giving the Croatian version of events on the defence of Dubrovnik during the 1991-95 war, it was well laid out and interesting to read. You step out of the fort",
          "This is just one of many gates and the bridges leading over it. It also provides a great view of the harbor. There are a few shops and cafes on the outside which are a little less expensive than those in the city",
          "This is in the old Napoleonic Fort at the top of the cable car and whilst you are up there it is well worth a visit. Not the most polished museum you will ever go in, but steeped in the history of the war in the 1990's and provides a much clear understanding of that unfortunate",
          "great overview of the war. Views are fabulous. Had lunch at Konoba on the way. Well worth the trip up the mountain.",
          "We all remember the war in the 90s but this exhibit is extremely informative. With text and pictures it describes the terrible events affecting Dubrovnik. As you stand on Mt. Srd above the Old Town of Dubrovnik it is easy to see why this site was of strategic importance.",
          "Although the content is as you would expect, informative with gruesome footage of the shelling bombardment, it is laid out in five main displays. The extra charge at the entrance can be a surprise if you paid what you thought was the combined trip price at the cable car",
          "There are many photo's showing the carnage of war during the war period in the early 90's, but none as thought provoking as the audio visual presentation. It shows a devastated Dubrovnik and it's courageous people and it is amazing and wonderful to see how the old town has been",
          "Set up in what looked like an old barn. Lots of episode stories and pictures and some old artillery etc.",
          "The museum is situated in the monument itself, i.e. Fort Imperial, where the fight was taken place around. Inside the museum, plenty of information was given though photos , video and texts. The content is heavily focused on the siege of Dubrovnik during 1990s and in",
          "Definitely worth a visit, you can sit and listen to reports and videos of the war as it was taking place.",
          "Very interesting and informative museum. Use the cable car for easy access! It's on top of a hill! It has pictures of the devastation in the area and a film show of the actual fighting and bombing.",
          "My husband and I visited the museum in the Fort having done the Buggy Safari.....it was a real eye opener with lots of information about the war...perhaps too much information in that there was an awful lot of reading!! There was also a TV showing news reports from the BBC on a",
          "We called in here whilst strolling the city after dinner. It is in the same building as the archives and it was free in the evening, we looked in during the daytime and it seemed there was an entry fee. For those of us who only experienced the Balkan war from a distance it is",
          "The visuals are good though the wordy panels make it less than likely you will stand and read all the explanations. This is still worth seeing to feel the seige that occurred and the stand off by the Croatian soldiers when the attack went on for days and months. An excellent way",
          "learn all about the serbian attacks on dubrovnik ...with photos and films very informative set in an old fort ...at the top of mount syd",
          "If you go up the cable car to admire the view, you may as well visit the museum as well while you are there. There isn't much to see display wise inside, apart from weapons and ammunition, but the exhibits on the walls detailing the history of the war was very informative and",
          "Well it's several degrees colder than the outside, so be warned. It's more an exhibition than anything else and be warned that it lacks any sort of fairness in the way it presents it's story, which I suppose is to be expected. Having visited the other former Yugoslavian",
          "This is one of the worst presented museums I've visited. There was no context provided (some background on the events leading up to the attacks on Dubrovnik would have helped) and the English translation was both inaccurate and dull. It's a real shame as the museum failed to",
          "The Museum of Croatian War of Independence is a low budget but passionate display on the war of 1991. It's a series of photo boards and displays chronicaling the Serbian attack on Dubrovnik. Although low budget, it's atmospheric and very informative. It's a must for those",
          "Tragic to see what these people and this city was put through in such recent times. It is a museum that is well worth a visit. In a place so beautiful such awlful things happened. Hopefully such events will never occur again.",
          "I didn't want to miss a chance to learn about the recent seige and near destruction of such a beautiful historic city. The fact it is Housed in a napoleonic fort was interesting enough. The photos were impressive but the text was too indepth and the English translations were not",
          "Well the photographs are moving sights....but overall the museum per se is just about OK....perhaps can be skipped",
          "Thought-provoking visit to this museum, very very sad to see the loss of so many young lives, a high price was paid for Independence, hopefully it will never happen again, God Bless the families of the brave young men who lost their lives.",
          "Maybe you can visit the hill By rental car or cable car for the view, but the museum it self is not so good. Mostly photos and maps etc.",
          "Having reached the top of Hill Sr\u0111, overlooking Dubrovnik, I was keen to visit the Napoleonic Fort Imperial. The Fort itself was the symbol of defence of the Dubrovnik against the 1991-1992 war with Serbia. As a museum, it's a fairly staid presentation, but fascinating",
          "The Musem is in Fort Imperial, that was heavily shelled and bombed by the Serbian Army in 1991. The fort is still standing, although it was built hundreds of years earlier to ward of arrows and small arms fire, not bombs and artillery fire. The musum is not fancy, but in",
          "There are heaps of photos, accounts, videos and artefacts in this museum, but the war is still so close that you come out feeling you have been a friend's shoulder to cry on rather than having visited an informative and unbiased narrative. The ITN news footage is compelling.",
          "You can visit the museum situated inside the Napoleonic Fort imperial by cable car or by road. The road journey is not for the feint hearted, a winding single track road up from the main road. The museum charts the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 - 95 and is an",
          "Good spot to go for amazing views as well as an insight into the war effects on the city. The old ITN news footage is very poignant. The exhibits involve mostly reading and looking at photos and could be enhanced a lot but it was still worth the visit. The building (old fort)",
          "Lots of writing to read through to get a better understanding of the war & some visual pieces/displays. Clearly momentus for Croatia in history terms and whilst well put together as a museum, there is lots to take in. However this means that as a positive you can take things at",
          "Amazing insight as to how the Old City was defended, lots of information and pictures, very moving, we actually left in tears.",
          "I encourage you not to miss this museum while in Dubrovnik. The museum captures the heart of the proud people of Croatia. And a war only 20 years ago! After visiting the museum walk back to the overlook and view the \"newer\" rooftops indicating those which were bombed then",
          "It's difficult to believe that this city was under siege that recently. This small museum brings the war in focus. It is worth visiting to see this part of Dubrovnik's history.",
          "When you take the Cable Car to the top of Mt. Srdj above the beautifull walled city of Dubrovnik you can walk a couple of minutes to the old Imperial Fort built in Napolean's time and there you will find the Museum of Croatian War of Independence. It is very good, lots of",
          "This may not be everyone's cup of tea but this a small intimate museum that tells of the recent struggles. I found it a sobering experience and that we should not forget the struggles and losses that the locals have experience in the not too distant past.",
          "This is a collection of considerable detail on the war of independence. The exhibition contains much more detail than most are interested but can be taken at your own paced for skipped through. Video loop on the UK ITV reports and other footage of the war is interesting. Venture",
          "This museum is located on the top of Sr\u0111 hill in the Imperijal fortress, where goes Cable car. In museum there are stories about Dubrovnik in Croatian homeland war, even weapons, and many pictures. Interesting to see how Dubrovnik (UNESCO site) was barbaric destroyed by serbian",
          "This museum gave me a better understanding of the war, which occurred 20 years ago. We also had the incredible opportunity to meet a few people who fought in that war. A wonderful tribute.",
          "Fort Imperial was almost but never captured during the War of Independence. The inside now contains many photographs and maps from the war. It's an easy walk to the Fort from the top of the Cable Car landing,",
          "We trekked up to the top of Srd as the cable car was not working due to high winds It was well worth a visit, gave me a better understanding of the effect of the war on the people of Croatio and especially Dubrovnik.",
          "This museum is a very moving experience. Watching the film loop of ITV news reports from only 20 years ago after having walked through the town and the very places you see on the film is incredible. Worth a visit, and walking up to the roof of the fort means you get a great",
          "This was worth seeing and experiencing what it was like during the war and how the town suffered in destruction and loss of life",
          "Great museum explaining what happened during the recent war. Many of the films are from British TV news clips, so very moving",
          "Great that the museum is housed in the fort that was repeatedly bombed and under fire during the siege with all the scars still there to see, only adding to the atmosphere. The displays were quite amateurish and rain blowing in through the torn plastic covering the blasted out",
          "Excellent. Well laid out, well presented. The most complete war museum I have visited. The best museum in Dubrovnik, and the most solemn; not a word spoken by anyone... Best 30kuna each spent on our 2000km 8 day heavenly trip of a wonderful country. Btw, visit Konoba Dubrova",
          "When you buy your ticket to the cable car, buy your museum ticket at the same time. Truly a great look at the history of the region. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "The old Napoleonic fort on top of the hills contains an amazing collection of photos and a video of news footage showing the bombardment of Dubrovnik in 1991. Yes it is biased but with good reason; Come here first then go down into the town, see the rebuilt buildings, sit by the",
          "Go up the cable car , round the back of the fort near the 4x4 cars and you'll find this exhibition down some old steps. It's 30 Kuna, shows the invasion and defence of Dubrovnic in the 90's. Covers some of the ground floor with static displays and a few news footage reels.",
          "This museum provides a good history of the war and the pain and suffering endured by the Dubrovnik residents. It also shows the damage intentionally inflicted on the historic Old Town by the Serbs.",
          "First, the museum is excellent. It is an excellent, but slightly, and understandably, biased telling of the horrible war that tore about Yugoslavia. It is presented in English for the most part. But the best part is the view that no one tells you about. There is a stair case"

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions.

          "Included in the 120kn museum ticket pass with other very interesting settings like Modern, Rector\u2019s Palace and Ethnological ones. Nice to visit the inside of the defensive tower on the port corner. The display is a classic maritim exhibition, still interesting.",

          "Not the largest of museums but had lots of information and exhibits regarding the old town. Historical information available and also the more recent siege / civil war that took place in Dubrovnik. Lots to see to keep you entertained for an hour or so. An insight into how the",
          "Visited as it was included as part of a tour of Dubrovnik taken from our cruise ship. Can't say that I was overly impressed by this museum. It may be of more interest if you are passionate about boats and maritime history.",
          "Housed within the massive St John\u2019s fortress is this excellent museum that puts Dubrovnik's long maritime history into easy to understand perspective. Great examples of Venetian glass from shipwrecks as models of vessels from roman (we especially liked the galleon displays) to",
          "According to the website it should be open to 18:00 but on arrival they had winter opening hours so they closed at 16:00. With just half an hour to closing time we decided not to enter. We asked if we could use the wc since we just had taken the tour on the wall... The harsh",
          "Visited here as it was included on the Dubrovnik card. The displays were good with lots of detail about the maritime history in Dubrovnik and Croatia but I felt it didn't really pull you in and in some respects the displays seemed quite bland.",
          "This exhibition did not float my boat. I have no particular interest in maritime things, but went to this exhibition as it was included in the 3 day Dubrovnik pass. I was, however, very interested to see that many of the Croatian ships were built in the UK.",
          "We went as it was included in our Dubrovnik card- if it wasn't, it wouldn't be worth the price of admission. It was a good place to cool off, but you'd have to be VERY into ships in order to really enjoy this place.",
          "With a lot of scale models of different boats ant other artifacts inside of the museum it was very interesting way to learn more about Dubrovnik maritime history.",
          "Attended because it was included with the \"dubrovnik card\". Ok exhibits very few real artifacts, lots of scale models. More I do on modern maritime stuff. Maybe go if it is raining and you have nothing else to do...",
          "This museum isn't so much about exploration, more about trade. I don't think that you can compare a maritime museum of a country like Croatia, with the fabulous exploration of the English, the Dutch or in fact, the Romans, who conquered half the world. The history described in",
          "really not all that much to say as there wasn't all that much to see! A lot of paintings of people and not a massive of boats. We have been to Maritime museums before and found them very interesting but this place was really average",
          "This is a gem of a museum. It's in a bright airy building built into the city walls. The collection ranges from medieval times to the present. I particularly enjoyed the artefacts from sunken ships, ancient glassware and the fabulous collection of original early maps. It was",
          "This small specialized museum provides good historical background in an authentic setting and a nice break from the scorching sun in the summer.",
          "This museum is part of the deal when you invest in the Dubrovnik card and it's an interesting enough stop along the city wall walk,however I doubt it would be value for money without it.",
          "It wasn't on my To Do list, and I wouldn't have visited had it not been included in the Dubronik Card, but I thought this was one of the highlights of Dubrovnik Card package. Everything was very logically presented, arranged in chronological order with bilingual explanations of",
          "Interesting maritime museum with lots of model ships, artefacts and information. It's quite heavy on croatian naval history in dubrovnik rather than general but it was the best museum we visited in dubrovnik in terms of professional exhibits. Not for everyone but interesting.",

          "I was very excited to visit the maritime museum, as it seemed to be a big part of this incredible town's history. However, any desire to look through this museum was completely stifled when the staff were unbelievably rude to me and my mother. After climbing many steps in the",
          "Located in St. John's fort, this museum shows some of the history of shipping in Dubrovnik. There are many ship models and pictures as well as maritime artifacts. I don't think it's worth the price of 120 kn, but it was included with the Dubrovnik Card.",
          "This museum can be reached while touring the city walls. It is on the first and 2nd floor of Fort St. John's. The entrance fee is covered by the Dubrovnik Card. Since it was once part of the fort the walls and location of the museum are quite spectacular. The museum has lots",
          "It wasn't that busy. I don't know why not; it's a fascinating place covering the whole maritime history of Dubrovnik from Roman times to the present. Beautifully laid out; excellent exhibit captions. A good cooling-off place on a hot day, as the enormously thick fortress",
          "It was nice to see, a lot of maritime tools, maps, and history touch of old local ship making. The only thing that did bother me was price of ticket....",
          "It was a hot day and a relief to get inside. The museum contained many interesting maps and exhibits relating to the maritime history of the port. I didn't find it boring (and I often do when visiting museums).",
          "Enjoyed this small museum as part of our tour of the City Walls. It came as part of our tour package. Was not crowded, was interesting with lots to look at. And provided a great respite from the heat and crowds touring the City Walls, Stradum and rest of old town. Note that our",
          "If I could give this zero stars, I would. As others have noted, the staff here are spectacularly rude, especially the red haired woman who literally screams and flaps her arms at visitors who are asking polite, routine questions. If you don't want to be verbally abused I would",
          "The museum had a nice little collection but was expensive. The admission was 120 HRK and included admission to other museums however the Rector's palace was closed",
          "According to the website for the Dubrovnik Pass, until recently this museum cost 40 kuna. The new price is 120 kuna, an increase of 300%. Now to be frank, this museum is interesting enough, but it is not worth anything like 16 euro. It is just a solid provincial museum with a",
          "This is definitely interesting for shipping and model enthusiasts but you can also learn quite a bit about Ragusa/Dubrovnik's historical economy and politics by reading the exhibits (good explanations in English).",
          "Stopped by the Maritime Museum as part of the well priced Dubrovnik museum pass. This one is just off the wall walk...easy. A potted history of old Dubrovnik's merchant marine history and great collection of scaled models. If you like great models of classic steam ships...a",
          "We visited this museum because it was included in the Dubrovnik- 1-day-card. It was interesting enough and the building itself is beautiful.",
          "The Maritime Museum was on the same ticket as the Rector's Palace - my main reason for going there. Museum occupies the two upper floors of the Fort of St. John, and it took me a while to figure out how to find the entrance. The aquarium is on the lower floors and is much",
          "Yes there are lots of model ships but not a great deal of interest.It needs updating with an a lot more information.By the way the installation of a loo would be appreciated.",
          "The museum has artefacts ranging from Roman times to almost the present day. There is emphasis on Ragusa (Dubrovnik) as an independent trading city, with documents and contracts from the State Archives dating back to the 12th Century, as well as a very good account of sail - and",
          "Interesting museum set in St Johns Fort, which is part of the city walls. Nice to wander around for an hour but don't expect it to be cool as the air-conditioning was no existent! Museum is set on 2 levels and I found the upper level with 19th/20th century exhibits of most",
          "No visit to old town Dubrovnik would be complete without a visit to the Maritime Museum. Lots of nice memorabilia and displays to document the sea history of the area. The boat models alone are worth the visit...and it gets you out of the sun!",
          "The museum labelling is invariably translated into English which makes it easy to appreciate individual exhibits and the most interesting historical background. We English think we have a great seafaring heritage but this exhibition shows how recent this is. When we pottering",
          "Myself and a friend visited using our Dubrovnik Day Card on a hot day on the last day of July. The museum is accessed via a section of the city wall and is spread over two floors. Upstairs focuses on 19th and 20th century history. Pros: -Friendly and helpful English-speaking",
          "We had a Dubrovnik card that included this museum. That is the reason why we went inside. It is rather small and shows the history of Dubrovnik based on trade mostly. Sadly not a lot of information is given. Most of the tines the explanations were barely 3 sentences or",
          "This place displays some lovely ship models and nautical instruments. If you are not keen on reading a lot your visit will be quite quick.",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987.

Its eastern shore belongs to Jordan, and the southern half of its western shore belongs to Israel. The northern half of the western shore lies within the Palestinian West Bank and has been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The Jordan River, from which the Dead Sea receives nearly all its water, flows from the north into the lake.Dead SeaSalt deposits at the Dead Sea near Masada, Israel.\u00a9 Kavram/Shutterstock.comJerusalem; Tel Aviv\u2013Yafo; Dead Sea; Red CanyonTime-lapse video of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv\u2013Yafo, the Dead Sea, and the Red Canyon.\u00a9 Mattia Bicchi Photography, www.mattiabicchiphotography.com (A Britannica Publishing Partner)See all videos for this articleThe Dead Sea has the lowest elevation and is the lowest body of water on the surface of Earth. For several decades in the mid-20th century the standard value given for the surface level of the lake was some 1,300 feet (400 metres) below sea level. Beginning in the 1960s, however, Israel and Jordan began diverting much of the Jordan River\u2019s flow and increased the use of the lake\u2019s water itself for commercial purposes. The result of those activities was a precipitous drop in the Dead Sea\u2019s water level. By the mid-2010s measurement of the lake level was more than 100 feet (some 30 metres) below the mid-20th-century figure\u2014i.e., about 1,410 feet (430 metres) below sea level\u2014but the lake continued to drop by about 3 feet (1 metre) annually.

          "We went there 10 years ago but I still remember this place! It is amazing and i will recommend all visitors of Dubrovnik to not miss to visit the \"Dead Sea\" location . Water is crystal clear and surroundings are breath taking. Will go there one day again!",
          "Beautiful spot in Lokrum island. Cristal clear water and (today) relaxing atmosphere. Nice stop to refresh the feet in the cold water after going up and down the Fort Royal. Meters from the rock beach to finish the day with a nice swim. Great visit to this natural reserve island",
          "Small pool (natural lake) in the middle 9f the island. Not deep, stones everywhere and not actually dead - I saw fish. Good thing it remains warm in sunny weather even in October.",
          "Beautiful spot with great view of crystal clear waters. Nice place to relax or have a quick swim.",
          "Nice lake but it was full of people and water looked not very fresh. I am sure I would be amazed to find this lake in the middle of the forest. But once you have access to beautiful and clean sea lake doesn't impress. I didn't have a swim at the end but made a photo of lake from the top- good spot.",
          "Small lake, water rather warm, not very clear. It was not deep so one  must carefully enter the lake due to the rocks. Is a good place to rest in the shadow during hot days\nThere is a spot 3m high, where adventurers  jump from in the lake",
          "An absolute must visit! Spend the whole day on the island and come here at 12-13pm, the best way to call down and still have fun or relax. Enter the cave aswell its beautiful",
          "Great little swimming hole. The water is very salty so you can easily float. The water is also quite deep which means you can jump and dive into the water easily. If you've got goggles, you'll love the seeing all the fish.",
          "Really good fun. Super salty so try and avoid swallowing!! Bar up top is cool as well, service is very slow mind you. This part of the island and especially the swimming area does get super busy so I would go earlier or later in the day go avoid the crowds. All in all a very good experience.",
          "Good place to swim if you have kids. Easily accessible by stone staircase. Water not as clean or clear as swimming in the sea. You can see small fishes living in the water.",
          "Fantastic day out from start to finish. Nice restaurants not over priced. Lovely to see peacocks,rabbits and tortoises wandering about. Definitely worth going",
          "It's a cute little beach, with shallow parts and more deep ones.\nThere is a bar on the top of beach, and the best part is that you can have a beer sitting in the rocks and enjoying the view.\n\nThere are rocks and sand in side the beach, if \u2026",
          "Very nice view.. From the cliff of the hill u can dive into the sea and tge color of the water was treat for eyes.. Loved the place",
          "A warm calm salt water pool located conveniently next to a cafe. However it would be much less expensive to bring a picnic lunch and don't forget your swim suit !",
          "Great little lake with salt water and plenty of fish to see.  Also nice to have the cave and overhanging trees for shade from summer sun.  Like most swimming spots in the region though aqua shoes or crocs advisable as you're walking in through stones.",
          "Great place. Calm but rocky. Don't forget to bring some water/sea shoes. Also there's not much space to but your beach towels. Still, it is a good place to visit. The water there is filled by high tides of the sea.",
          "It is a marine lake rich in fish. Beautiful surrounding nature with many animals in the wild such as peacocks. \nSwim is possible.\nThe island of Lokrum is a stop not to be missed if you are in Dubrovnik.",
          "Lokrum near Dubrovnik \nA beautiful national park island\nRoaming wild peacocks and rabbits. 120 kuna entry on arrival on the island. 3 hours here is plenty. A quick pit stop at this Dead Sea lake was lovely.",
          "We didn't swim here as we're quite limited for time, but looked the perfect place! Plus the hilarity of peacocks popping up on the shore",
          "Water slightly stagnant with lots of fish. And lots of pine needles on stones. However a great pool with easy access for kids",
          "A great place to swim in salt water with no current or waves. Plenty of places to suntan as well. Beautiful place and well worth going. The whole island is amazing.",
          "Long bus trip to get here from Jerusalem and when you're here you'll feel the vastness of the area and the calmness of the sea. Then you'll hear some screaming and chatter from tourists of different nation rubbing mud on their body and \u2026",

          "Beautiful pond with sea water. Great alternative for sea, if you don't like waves.",
          "Beautiful little beach area. Pebbly. Sea shoes are a very good thing to purchase before going there and most other beaches in croatia. The rocks that are under the water are quite slippy and mossy.",
          "My son got stung by a sea anemone. Spent the remainder of holiday in Hospital. Take care!",
          "Nice place to cool down and swim at hot day.",
          "Absaluctly beautiful island. Lots to do for the family",
          "Was very hot in September and below sea level can affect your breathing if you are an Asthmatic but was fantastic to experience.",

          "It\u2019s very pretty, much warmer than ocean even thought it is supposedly filled from the bottom. It\u2019s nice but... hot. No wind, breeze, nothing!",
          "This is just like a pool inside an island. So refreshing, and a bit chilling though, after quit a walk on the island. Don't forget your swim suits and bikinis :)",
          "Relaxing island, lokrum, plenty to do and see, especially If you are a GoT fan - As the Iron Throne is located there. Good half day possibly full day out depending on if you want to relax after doing/visiting what is available!",

          "Its wild! But friendly. Popular attraction. Worth spending the day on the island.",

          "Awesome place for a cool down whilst exploring Lokrum.",
          "Beautiful location, wouldn't call it a dead sea though. It's only a little more floaty than the ocean, if at all. Nice little area to check out if you have a day in dubrovnik as we did (came with a cruise ship), lots of people cliff diving \u2026",
          "Very atmospheric place to swim with cliffs and caved. Relaxing.",

          "What an amazing place well worth a visit",

          "It was worth a visit, it's a nice, shadowy place with a restaurant nearby. The water however, was not very clean.",
          "Well worth a dip!",

          "Lovely place to visit in amongst a cool island",
          "This is a beautiful, partly-shaded oasis on Lokrum island. The water is clean (and very very salty) and it\u2019s a nice place to spend an afternoon. The ocean is only a minute or so away by foot so it\u2019s easy to swim at both locations.",

You need to take  boat over from Dubrovnik its 150hkr (~\u20ac21). Quiet deep in places and there is a small cave to swim into. Afterwords there is a nice flat rock area to lie out on.",
          "It's a beautiful place, especially on a sunny day. The water was a bit cold but did not stop me from swimming in. The place is rocky, so make sure to bring slippers or water shoes along. The water is shallow so I wouldn't recommend jumping \u2026",
          "Very Rocky, make sure you wear some sort of shoe when going in!",
          "Amazing setting. Lovely shelted cove.Cafe over looking it is nice and a little overpriced but not too bad for where it is. Very pretty.",
          "Nice small saltwater lake with warm and clear water. \nIf you visit Lokrum, you should definitely see this place and maybe go for a swim. \nSince it\u2019s such a small lake, the beaches/rocks around it are scarce and you might have to wait for a \u2026",
          "Really quiet and peaceful little swim spot. Ended up spending most of the day here! Can't say I noticed any extra buoyancy compared to the sea, but still a great spot. Rocks to jump from if you like or just a pebbley walk in (be careful \u2026",

          "Fun place to swim",
          "Great scenery and a good place for a swim. Bring a towel and you can chill out on the rocks. I feel calling it 'THE DEAD SEA' is quite misleading as it is just a lagoon fed from the sea which is definitely not dead, there is plenty of fish in here and you do not float as you would in a salt lake/dead sea.",
          "Lovely place to just relax. Water is a bit chilly but once you're in it's very refreshing. Scene is absolutely beautiful and very calm and peaceful. Water is very clean and perfect for swimming or paddling. Well worth the trip.",

          "Definately an area of outstanding natural beauty, but overcrowded and a bit dirty when we visited.",
          "Wonderful little place. It's a great stop off during the day to cool down in the calm water. Might be difficult to get a spot to put your towel down especially if there's more than 2 people but it's well worth taking a swim into the cave there. ",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987. Often regarded as a 'Supergroup' due to the band members having played in various established bands such as Hoodoo Gurus, Beasts of Bourbon, and The Scientists. The band chose their name due to two members of the band Roddy Radalj (guitar vocals) and Boris Sujdovik (bass) being born in Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDalmatia\nDubrovnik chess set\nList of people from Dubrovnik\nRepublic of Ragusa\nTourism in Croatia\nWalls of Dubrovnik\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Ragusa\", Bradshaw's Hand-Book to the Turkish Empire, 1: Turkey in Europe, London: W.J.

The Men\u010deti\u0107 family owned the ground the tower was built upon hence it's name. Originally built in 1319 but reinforced in",

          "Part of the city walls walk and a key GoT site where Danaerys tried to enter the House of the Undying. Impressive tower in its own right also.",
          "While walking the old city walls you will come across this fortress and be able to climb up for a view. This 14th-century fortress is located at the highest point of Dubrovnik offering panoramic city & sea views.",
          "yes...me and my 68 yr old mum walked through the whole circumference of the ancient city walls. i completed the wall walk by climbing up to take a photo of Croatia flag!!! i m feeling the achievement and accomplishment becos i used to gave up half way as i m too tired to go",
          "There are nice views from this fort on the wall walk. Quite expensive for the ticket but a must see part of Dubrovnik.",
          "Highest point of the walls so another perspective and more great views of the old town and its surroundings. Definitely worth paying for the old walls ticket, which is much less with a student card or the Dubrovnik card!",
          "If your in Croatia you must see old town Dubrovnik, it was truly amazing walking around old lanes and seeing first hand where game of thrones and other movies are made. The water is so crystal and pristine. Also travel out cavart along their river is and up to the mountains for",
          "This is the highest point of the walk around the walls of Dubrovnik and is towards the end of the walk (you can only go in one direction which really helps manage the crowds). I found it worth doing as part of the challenge of doing the walk however it was a little underwhelming",

          "We only went to the fortress as it was in with the ticket from the city wall. Plenty of steps to climb. Not a lot to see apart from a few cannons. Best part was the views from the top very disappointed.",

          "Many people get so tired and hot by the time they get to this corner. Well worth going up to the highest point, the views are great and it is great to check out. Oozes of history too, kind of fun to just be in there thinking back to who was there and when. Well worth checking",

          "The views from the fortress are stunning. I almost didn't go up to the top as the thought of more stairs at the very end of the walk was a bit off-putting but I'm so glad I persevered as the view that you have of the Old City is breathtaking. The fortress has to be done as part",

          "For history buffs, this is a great spot to visit to sure up understanding and knowledge of the areas history. Views are terrific and photo opportunity are plenty. If its a windy day, be careful of the steps, and it is a bit of an effort to take the walk, but very worth it",

          "History , Architecture, Sights of game of throne, view of Adriatic just a masala movie of Bollywood. You can spend at least 2-3 hours here. Recall Game of Throne seen . It featured as the House of the Undying in Qarth in Season 2 Episode 10 \u2018Valar Morghulis\u2019 when Daenerys",
          "So by the time I recached this fortress I was becoming very tired from all the steps and granted the last few steps to the top were daunting. However the view was totally worth it. You really get to see another side of Old Town from here and see the beauty of it all. Also, it is",

          "Though perhaps less picturesque than expected for a medieval fortress right outside the city walls of the Adriatic jewel of Dubrovnik, this bulky yet impressive fortress overwatches the fort of Dubrovnik and provides a breath stopping view of the town and its surroundings.",
          "This is probably the highest point on the old city walls of Dubrovnik and it is worth persevering and walking up to it despite the mob around you because the views over the old town and the old port and beyond are lovely. The red pantile roofs of historic Dubrovnik are spread",

          "The fortress itself isn\u2019t all that impressive. It\u2019s claim to fame is a Game if Thrones scene with Daenerys. You\u2019ll see tourists trying to recreate this scene by walking around the base of the tower with their arm outstretched, touching the wall. The real draw here though is",
          "A very nice fortress as part of the city wall. Such a magnificent experience to see and climb this ancient building. A lot of cool photo opportunities as well. And of course.. a Game of Thrones location (House of the Undying). Definitely worth a visit!",
          "The fort is the setting for \"Game of Thrones\" and there are plenty guides to escort you. If you don't know about the series then there's not a lot of point going. lots of steps. The views from the top are good.",
          "After a steady climb from the entrance point at the old port and with the views expanding over the old city the highest point on the wall are reached at the Minceta. The views are fabulous and well worth what could be for a lot of people quite a serious effort to get here",
          "Highest point of the city walls for you to take pictures. Even more steps to climb, but worth the effort. Of course GOT fans will recognise this tower ... There is a forgery museum down under this tower:\u2026",
          "Min\u010deta Fortress is the massive round fort topped by gothic crown (and the Croatian flag) on the north west corner of the city walls. It is the symbol of unconquerable Dubrovnik, and is especially majestic when lit at night. Originally built in 1319, it was remodeled in 1461",
          "Came here on a games of thrones tour, although I have never seen the program I appreciated the sights and this fortress gave lovely views. Our ticket from the walls meant we didn't have to pay the entrance fee and there were toilets here too.",
          "This part of the walls gave the best views over the city and beyond from this highest vantage point. Not the easiest part of the climb but worth the extra sweat. Just fantastic looking down from here",
          "Being the tallest of all towers along the walls of Dubrovnik, it has superb views all over the town and extending to the Adriatic. This tower featured in the Game of Thrones as the house of the Undying in Qarth. It can get a bit crowded in the peak hours as you'd expect, so go",
          "The fortress entrance is part of the 1,3 and 7 days city pass and its well worth the short walk... Make sure you keep your city walls passes, because they are your entry tickets for the fortress.. otherwise you have to pay the entrance again...",
          "This is the highest point on the walls and well worth walking to the top for the superb view. You can easily see the whole city and the walls. It is of particular interest for a Game of Thrones fans as it was used in the filming.",
          "If you take the wall tour you will also get to climb Minceta Fortress. The view from here is amazing, for those who are not afraid of heights. A fair few steps to climb to the top.",
          "You'll need some puff to climb the steps but take your time and ensure you reach the top for fantastic views across the Old Town, the Pile district and up to Mount Srd. Probably the highlight of the Walls walk.",
          "Best bit for us was walking round the base of the tower and taking cheesy photos recreating Daenerys looking for her dragons. If you are trying to preserve your energy then don\u2019t bother climbing to the top as the views are not markedly better.",
          "This is reached during walking on the walls of the old town. Views are worth the climb. I think it might be the highest part of the walls.",
          "With its magnificent crown, this tower has dominated the city for centuries and continues to dominate today. It was the symbol of its freedom and a spiteful challenge to all the impertinent, and today is one of the most beautiful symbols of the city. With its lovely",
          "Walking the walls of the fortress is a must when visiting Dubrovnik Old City-the views are breathtaking!It just gets better and better as you go up.You could spend hours just looking at the view.There are cafes where you can stop and take it all in as well as have a drink.There",
          "It is worth climbing all the steps to get to the top here. Even if you are not a Game of Thrones fan the history and views make the effort worthwhile. On the bright side as it is the highest point of the City Wall which ever way you are walking the wall it is largely downhill",
          "This fortress is part of the ancient city walls, so you'll need to buy a ticket to the walls in order to see it. But once you've climbed up, from here you have the best view of the whole city, over the old town and to the harbour. Also, if you're a Game of Thrones fan, get a",
          "Located towards the end of the walk around the walls, this fortress will be familiar to Game of Thrones fans as the location of the House of the Undying, where Daenerys went to find her dragons after they were stolen from her in Qarth. Unlike in the series, it is possible to",
          "You will the fortress towards the end of the city walls,walk. You will be tired but make the effort to climb the steps and see the lovely views from a different angle. This fortress bias been preserved and has been used in games of throne filming. Take your,water and snacks with",

          "This requires climbing many steps to get to the top for its optimal view, but it is well worth it. You get to see a different view and angle of the walls and \u2018old town\u2019. Must history to appreciate. Entrance is free with the purchased ticket to walls, otherwise it is 150 Kuna.",
          "We started the walls walk at Ploce gate, one to beat the crowds and do the steepest part first. We had the huge fort all to ourselves there is excellent views from the top and many piccies to be had.",
          "Have to pay to do the wall tour but worthwhile, views are amazing, in september was crowded but not as much as summer. Good amount of walking",
          "This is a magical image, especially if you are a fan of GoT. You feel like you are right in the middle of the series. I suggest you visit the wall early morning so you do not get wiped out by the sun.",

          "A popular spot on the city walls, take lots of pictures and soak in the grandeur. Wear sunscreen. Avoid in the afternoon or you will be too hot. Take water up there with you. Take your time to see all there is.",

          "Great views of the city and the Adriatic off in the distance. It's the final \"attraction\" as you walk on the city walls.",
          "Minceta is NOT a separate attraction. You need a city walls ticket to access it. If you start your walk using the entrance by the Pile Gate Minceta will be your last stop before completing the wall loop. Nothing much to see here but the top does boast a nice view of the city,",
          "There is a lot of history at this old fortress and an interesting museum. The views are excellent too.",
          "Nice walk on the walls. Great views, pictures. Don't go when whether is sunny and hot. Full circle is about an hour or so.",
          "From the walls it is another climb up in to the fort via a narrow stairway. However, it is well worth it for the views from the top. Sitting at the inland western edge of the old town you have a view across the entire old town and Adriatic beyond.",
          "If you start your tour of the city wall from the Pile Gate, the Minceta Fortess is almost the last thing you come to. This is probably the most robust structure in the formidable city wall.",
          "This 14th century round tower have been made famous in popular TV series GAME OF THRONES. This tower is the highest point of the City Walls and will give you amazing panoramic view of the city and the adriatic sea. This tower is considered as thd symbol of the city which you",
          "Very cool this place. It's easy to think of it just as a film/tv set but then you remember that people used to use this as an ACTUAL FORTRESS and you remember how boss that actually is.",
          "A Fortress, which is very well maintained and is totally worth it to be visited (you can do it with a City Wall Tour).",
          "This offers a great view of the Old Town. it's a simple walk up some extra stairs during your walk on the wall.",
          "Worth the steps up for the view. Part of the city walls ticket. Game of Thrones viewers should stop here; some scenes were filmed.",
          "It can be a hike to get here. Its is worth it to see the view s though. Minceta Fortress is the highest point along the walls and offers some of the best views of the city roofscape and distant islands.",
          "This is the highest point of the City Wall. The view is better but for me it is just an average view. To get better view, it is better to go to highest hill using cable car or from Fort Lovrijenac. This place is very close to the end of the trip going around the City Wall.",
          "This is the highest part of the ancient city walls which you can explore. It's worth the hike up for views, photos and a good overview across the old town. Some steps are steep so make sure you wear sensible shoes. I did see a baby getting carried on a parents back but",
          "To get here you have to pay to walk the walls. The view down is worth it and they filmed some game of thrones up here if you like the show. Pretty neat place to see and enjoy the city from but a steep short climb to the top from the wall walk.",
          "I suppose you have to walk the walls to be able to climb up Minceta fortress. This is the highest point of the walls so gives some of the best views of the old town. It is well worth doing!",
          "This is one of the best spots to have good views of the city. The fort is not much but the views are nice. You will come to it automatically as part of the wall walk.",
          "Can only be visited, ans part of the walls tour.. The imposing structure, is the highest point on the wall, and offers great views from the top..Also used in many scenes from Game of Thrones.. Also imposing to look at from the roads outside.. Has under gone many rebuilds from",
          "Decided to save this views for the end so walked the fortress from the other end. The orange roofs, the churches and the marina are all visible - worth the climb!",
          "Around this place is probably the best location to get the best picture of the old town. The fort itself is not so much to see",
          "This is the highest point when walking the city walls. As you all walk in one direction when walking the wall, Minceta will be to most walkers towards the end of your walk. Even if you are feeling tired make you visit Minceta as you get the best views from here.",
          "Towards the end of the Wall Walk, you come to this Fortress. Used to film Game of Thrones scenes with the Mother of Dragons herself, it offers fantastic views of the old city and beyond to Lokrum Island. Worth the climb if your knees can take it.",
          "Minceta Tower is located in the Minceta Fortress and part of the City walls. It is the highest point in the Dubrovnik defense system. On top of it there is a Gothic crown which is more decorative than a symbol of strategic importance.",
          "Minceta Fortress, the highest point in Dubrovnik's defense system, is a large fort integrated in the Northern part of the city walls. It offers stunning views of Dubrovnik and is a symbol of the unconquerable City.",
          "Lovely part of the walk around the city walls. Stopped to recreate some GOT photos! There are plenty of spots around the city to do this!",
          "As I was traveling with my young adult children who watch the series, this was a must see for them. The stairs up are quite steep and narrow, but the views are worthwhile.",
          "This place gives you the perfect view to old town and the city walls. Lots of steps also but not so many tourists as there is on the city walls. Students bring your ISIC-cards. You can get a combined ticket for the city walls and fortress on student prices.",
          "This is a pretty steep climb, lots of steps and not suitable for those with mobility difficulties or prays. The views are spectacular and if you are a Game of Thrones fan there are areas used during filming.",
          "Once you reach the Minceta fort, you will feel like you are above everyone and everything in the Old Town ( and actually, you will be ). For the Game of Thrones fans, this fort was used to film The House of Undying when Khaleesi disappeares so just walking around it and you will",
          "This is a stunning fort to visit high above the harbour. The views here and all along the city walls are just magnificent. Great photo op! Lots of cannon, battlements and stone fortifications to enjoy. I just relaxed for a while looking down on Dubrovnik and the sea. It's an",
          "This is only accessible if you do the city walls walk, so you get 2 for 1!! more steps to climb but again worth it for the views of the city, fort and outside of city",
          "This fortress is near the end of the City Wall walk (approx. 2 & a half hours long). Some more steep steps to go up but please don't miss it. More photo opportunities.",
          "One of the best parts of Dubrovnik. It is highest point on Duborvnik city walls. Fantastic views over the city and the sea.",
          "The Minceta Fortress is near the end of the one way Ctiy Wall walk so you would most probably be quite tired at this juncture. You are rewarded however with a terrific view of the Old Town of Dubrovnik because located at the North Western most end of the Old Town, it has the",
          "Minceta Fortress is part of the City Walls walk; in fact it is the highest point. You can see how this would have been used as a strategic look-out back in the day. From up here, you can see everywhere. Great views of the whole city and beyond.",

          "If you're already doing the city wall walk, don't skip this part, because you've already paid for it :) Yes, it's extra stairs to climb but the view is totally worth it. It's the highest point of the city walls and you can see old town in all its splendour. It's a perfect",
          "Has a beautiful view over the Old Town and Placa Throroughfare. Available through entering the Old Walls gate and a ticket has to be bought.",
          "Most people tour the Walls and they will have the opportunity to access the most fortified and highest point on the Walls. The views are very special and you will never forget them. As it is the highest point and towards the end of the Wall walk, it's a bit of a hike getting to",
          "The Minceta Fortress is the highest point of the ancient city walls, and it's funny that it is listed separately on Tripadvisor. All of that being said, when visiting the ancient city walls, spot out the highest point (which is a tower), and that is Minceta Fortress. The city",

          "Yep, that is the tower. Besides as the filming location, you can also go up to the fortress and look at the old town. A very nice view of the old town.",
          "This Fortress is on the last corner, just before you finish the City Walls walk. If you've timed it right and it's late afternoon, the light for taking pictures should be ideal, the views are great too! The stairway to the top is a little claustrophobic and only one person wide,",
          "Yes, there are a few steps, but even from the walls without climbing you get a great view over the red roof tops of the city. The Fortress is a part of the wall walk and you have to pay to make the walk.",
          "This is the best place to take panoramic pictures of the old city. The view from here is enchanting... not to miss attraction.",
          "You can see the whole city from here, as the title said. Not the easiest place to climb up as its a free for all on the steps up. When you finally do it makes it all worth while, spend a coupe of minutes on each corner and look at the city below.",
          "The castle and surrounds provide the tourist or history academic with fantastic opportunities to explore ancient and modern history from the period of the Crusades through to the Balkans' war. Views over Dubrovnik are fantastic and the Fort gives one the chance to look across",
          "it looks like a crown on top of the city and the view is perfect. Can get a bit crowded but definitely worth it.",
          "So amazed to be in a beautiful place and n awe of its spectacular surroundings, to reach the top of Minceta was a thrill for me and getting there there and living and seeing all the beauty surrounding us was just a dream !!!",
          "While the tower itself is very impressive, we mostly enjoyed the views over the old town from here. It was also nice to imagine the scenes from GoT filmed here.",
          "The Minceta Fortress forms part of the old town walls and is probably the single highlight although you only need to spend a few minutes here. It's a photogenic spot and you can get plenty of good photos across the town from here because it's the highest point of the tour around",
          "This is part of the cities walls walk - so if you're doing that don't skip it. Good for a photo, but don't spend all day there.",
          "Our family of 5 visited Dubrovnik's city walls in July 2016. The Minceta Fortress is part of the city walls so you can't really miss it if you make your way around. The climb wasn't difficult at all even though it came at the end of the city walls.",
          "A landmark in the history of the region, One cannot help but be moved. Strongly recommend walking up the whole trail to the top. While tiring, it is panoramic view after panoramic view and puts both your geography and life in perspective. Cable Car is optional, but can be",

          "Minceta Fortress, as one of the highest fortifications along the walls, is most certainly a highlight on the walk along the ancient fortifications of Dubrovnik Old Town. If possible, do attempt the steep stairs up the tower and be rewarded with splendid views of the Old Town!",
          "The highest point of the city walls and the highlight of a walk around the walls. The fortress is amazingly well preserved and views over the top of the city are absolutely fantastic.",
          "This is the best spot on the city walls to take photos. Doesn't cost any extra (you already paid to visit the city walls).",
          "If you start the city wall tour at Pile Gate and walk counter clockwise this will be your last stop and the highlight of the walk. You get another great view across the old town and can see where you have been and what you have visited.",
          "I took my friends on the tour of the City Walls and we had great time walking around and taking tons of photos. Monceta Fortress is almost at the end of the tour and although we were a bit tired we climbed the stairs and went to it's top floor. The view is magnicent for up",
          "You need some stamina and some audacity to make the final push for the summit, but you do get some great views of the Old City and the surrounding areas from this vantage point which is, possibly, the last real attraction on the anti-clockwise city wall tour.",
          "Offers more lovely views of Old Town, Island of Lokrum and the Harbour among others. Great location for pictures.",
          "Part of the city walls activity- the views are amazing over Dubrovnik and you can take some cool photos with the huge flag at the top",
          "The fortresses on the city wall trip were well worth visiting. Quite high so be aware if you can't take small steep steps.",
          "Along the city walls you will come upon the Minceta Fortress, we visited on a hot day and my partner did not fancy the extra steps up to the top. I did it and the stairs are a tight squeeze but the views from the top are worth the climb. We also checked out the game of thrones",
          "If your walking the walls of Dubrovnik, definitely check out this fortress. The views of the old town are amazing and if your a GoT fan it's even better to see one of the filming locations. You can get some amazing photos from here as well.",
          "Enjoyed cable car ride up-view was stunning(you can also drive), and visited adjoining museum dealing with many photos, descriptions, and a film of the 1991-92 siege of Dubrovnik by Bosnian & Montenegro forces. (senior discount)",
          "The Minceta Fortress is a nice stop along the wall to take in views of the city and sea, but also have a breather while taking the steep steps and slanting wall walkway tour.",
          "The view is just overwhelming! Well worth all the stairs you had to climb to see. Absolutely don't miss.",
          "The highest point of the rempart is really the most beautiful scenery of the Old city Raguse. It took more than 2 hours to reach the place . It participates to the experience of Dubrovnik that made so unforgettable !",
          "From the Game of Thrones bastion. This is a must do on the tour of the walls. Trust us on this now yes?",
          "We explored Minceta Fortress as part of a City Walls tour, this fortress it the highest and most impressive part of what is a five star attraction. Tips - This is the best view point of the walls - Go with a guide, there is a lot of history to be heard.",
          "You can't miss this Fort that you will see North of the Pile Gate before you enter. It is the highest point in the city and as such is a great opportunity for photos above the city. Can only be accessed by paying 120 kn to walk the walls though. It can also be viewed from quite",
          "Really nice experience walking along the Dubrovnik Walls. We stopped to cool off and had a drink, then enjoyed the views from the top of the Minceta Fortress.",
          "We learnt a lot of history and beautiful views but quite a few steps to do ,the guy was very friendly were you paid it was well worth the steps.",
          "Dubrovnik, a city of 50,000 people, is spread out along the meandering Dalmatian coast line on the Adriatic Sea, squeezed tightly between the water and the towering mountains just to the north like a Croat sandwich. It is one of Europe\u2019s most popular tourist destinations and a",
          "First of all the city of Dubrovnik is a hot item with over 1 million visitors via cruise ships by September. So get to the fortress by 8am or be standing by the Pile Gate waiting to get in. This walk along the top wall offers magnificent views of the city and the sea. You won't",
          "From this point you can see very well the city and outside the city. You can take cool \"postal-style\" pictures from over there and on the way there. And it's a must! You can't say you visit Dubrovnik without going there.",
          "This fortress is part of the city wall. Almost at the end. You will see this impressive fortress while just wondering in the streets of dubrovnik. I loved the views from here. I will however make use of a tour. As there is so much history behind these walls. Take a good camera",
          "Highest vantage point on the walk around the City Walls (only accessible that way also). Good photo opportunity up top as it has a great view of the Old Town as well as most of the rest of the City Walls. Make the climb up the narrow stairway, it's worth it.",
          "One of the most impressive parts of fantastic city walls walk so it is strange to see it listed as another attraction. It is interesting though and a real triumph of engineering. I really enjoyed spending time marvelling at the views.",
          "This fortress is right near the end of the City Wall walk and while you'll have to climb a few stairs to reach the top, the view is incredible. You can see the entirety of old town stretched out below you. It's the highest point of the city wall and I can see how it would be",
          "You can enter the fortress after almost ending the city walls-walk. If you have walked all they way around, you might as well get up the tower and watch the view.",
          "Minceta is simply the highest point on the city walls, so you reach and enter it on the same ticket. It's quite an impressive tower, and once you finally make the climb along the city's northern walls, and then up the inside of the tower, you're rewarded with some incredible",
          "We went up here when we were walking around the wall. This is nice to go up to the top and have a look around. The views are nice and there are a lot of people who go up so there could be a slight wait to go up the stairs as it is narrow and difficult for people to cross on the",
          "You run into the fortress if you are doing the city wall walk, indeed its the only way to get here, The views of the sea, the fortress and the interior of the city are fantastic, and if you only do one thing in Dubrovnik, I recommend that you do the city walls walk, there are 3",
          "As this is a 14th century fortress that is a part of the city walls it would be a loss not to take the opportunity to have the best views of the Old Town. The fortress in itself was not so interesting as the views. It is no more than a few minutes detour from the regular city",
          "Up high with great views in the land of Game Of Thrones! Cant go wrong!. A hot tiring walk to get there but its worth it!",
          "The best place to take photos on the city walls of Dubrovnik. Especially in the afternoon when the sun is behind your back.",
          "the most beautiful views of the city, second to none. A bit of a climb to get to, but well worth the effort.",
          "Lots of steps up to the fort but great views of the old town and ocean, surprisingly badly signposted from the main tourist square",
          "I absolutely recommend to visit this place! Offers a breathtaking view of the city and the sea. From a historical point of view very interesting fortification.",
          "For fans of GoT, this is the House of the Undying, or at least the outside. You definitely get some amazing views, especially if you are not able to go up the cable car. It's the highest point along the city walls and you can really get a feel of the alleys that meander through",
          "Definitely worth it. Make sure you have water with you, if you are doing it when it is sunny especially.",
          "This was one of my favorite parts of the city walls. It was about 90 F during my walk (and no clouds to help) so I definitely wasn't looking for more stairs to climb but the view from the top of Minceta can't be beat!",
          "When walking around the old town walls this is yet another set of steps that need to be walked up and, if you are hot and tired it would be easy to decide not to bother but no pain, no gain and the views from the top are astounding so make sure you make the effort, take a bottle",
          "Well worth it just to see the views. Takes a bit of walking up to, but lovely once you get there. Probably best either early or late in the day as it would soon get crowded around the city walks with only a few people up there. Take some water - particularly if you head up in",
          "Great place to walk and explore. There are 4 main towers, and this is one. It is near the cable cars.",
          "A lovely fort with great views across Dubrovnik. You will see this and the views when you do the walk of the city walls! Be careful though as the stairs on this one are steep!",
          "Real asset for the walls fortifications. Stunning panorama and wonderful point for seeing all the surrounding countryside as well as the layout of the inner city.",
          "Well worth the short climb for the wonderful views it offers of the city. An ideal place to take photos as souvenirs of your visit.",
          "Beautiful on a boating trip, lovely stop over Enjoy it before its spoilt Great swimming off quiet coves",
          "A unique stop along the Dubrovnik city walls that - of course - photos were taken at due to its inclusion in HBO's Game of Thrones as part of Daenerys' storyline in season 2 as the House of the Undying. Any GoT fan has to take a picture, and for those who aren't it's still a",
          "Another GoT location. A stiff walk around the walls, or up the first stairway and to the right as you enter the city via the Pile Gate. This offers a truly magnificent view of the city and the island of Lokrum.",
          "My sons were excited when we reached the Minceta Tower. They recognized the specific spot where a Game of Thrones scene was filmed. For me, there were more fantastic views from its top. The stairs were a little steep but not particularly difficult.",
          "One of the many fortresses on the city walls walk, offering grand views over Dubrovnik and the Adriatic.",
          "Getting up there was a bit of a struggle in the heat (+30 degrees and over that day) but the view is great.",
          "After walking part way around the walls, it was worth climbing up a few more steps to get to the top of the fortress. The views are great, across the city and out to sea. It was good to be able to get a good view of the walls from the top as well. There are places to sit and",
          "By visiting the fortress it spilled out great views below and the surrounds were so pretty and with a wonderful view down to the water !",
          "We toured the fortress as part of the wall walk and were not disappointed. The fortress itself gives you the highest view of Dubrovnik Old Town and if you like Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate its use as the House of the Undying.",
          "The fortress was a great finish to the walk on the wall. The kids loved the place and the view from there. It gave them the motivation to complete the walk around the city on the wall",
          "Minceta fortress, you can't miss this if you visit the old city Dubrovnik. It is the top point of the city wall and the view is astonishing. Entrance to the wall tickets include the fortress as well. A narrow path up the steps to the fortress but you should try. Absolutely worth",
          "This is the highest point of the city walls and if it's a windy day, you certainly feel it. Quite a few stairs to climb to reach the top and the stair case is narrow, but certainly worth it as the views are spectacular! The fortress is part of the walls and of course is",
          "Although the original tower dates back to the 14th century, it was reshaped in the 15th century by a famous Florentine architect. It stands on the city side of the walls. It is massive but bears a certain (military) elegance with its defensive crown on the top tower. When you",
          "Minceta Fortress is the large tower at the highest corner of the city walls. You can't visit it separately from the walls. You'll go through it on the way round the walls. It's the House of the Undying from Game of Thrones.",
          "The Minceta is the Tower Minceta dominates the north western part of the city and walls. It was built in 1319 originally as a strong four sided fort by a local builder Nicifor Ranijina.",

          "Lots of stairs and walking along the city walls to get here, but well worth it for the views! 100K entry onto city walls to get to it",
          "If you are here is because you are already up in to the ancient city walls, so a few more steps shouldn\u00b4t be a problem (even being some steep steps, beware) and you will be delighted with a great view over the old town and Pile gate. Here, as well as the rest of the city",
          "To see the most of the old city without going to the hill, it's the best spot. And, if you're a fan of Game of Thrones, you certainly will recognize the door of the House of Undying.",
          "Well worth a visit very moving tribute. I hadn't realised what these people went through and they were not all trained soldiers.",
          "The fortress is a part of the city walls and included in the ticket. View from the top is amazing. Steep steps but a must do.",

          "The city wall walk includes the Minceta tower. From here you get great elevated views over the old town and Pile gate. The steps are steep, so be careful.",
          "To get an incredible view of the old town, if you are on the city wall walk, climb up the steep stairs and you will be amazed. The fortress is the last fort that you come to on the wall walk, and they definitely save the best for last.",
          "My \"Game of Thrones\" son and husband loved stopping here but I wasn't able to climb to the top due to mobility issues so be careful not to find yourself at the top if you have trouble getting down steep stairs as coming down could actually be more difficult than going up. As I",

          "There is no exhibit or interior to look at, only the view from the turrets, which on a clear day will be stunning. This is the King's Landing from Game of Thrones. The way up is a little tricky to find, so best to ask the tourist office once you are outside the city gates. If",
          "The fortress is accessed via a set of very steep steps and is part of the walled city walkway. It's certainly worth making the effort for the stunning city views which reward you.",
          "You can't help but notice the fort whether you're on the City Walls or not. As you're going around you'll definitely come to this fort. Steep steps going up, but fun to see the views from that high up too. And Game of Thrones fans can almost feel the spirits of their favorite",

          "This is a way-point on the city walls, and a lot of Game of Thrones was filmed here so it's worth seeing if you're a fan. Even if not, the city walls are a must-visit as you get a unique perspective on the town",

          "Could be more informative with some notices or guidance ... well preserved and the views are good...",

          "Minceta Fortress is the most impressive of all the fortifications along Dubrovnik's city walls. It is in the north east corner and \u00be of the way around if you start the walk at Pile Gate. The wall walk can be challenging on hot days and Minceta Fortress has some rooms that",
          "This is the highest point of the walls around the city. The views from here are fantastic. It is a bit of a climb but well worthwhile.",

          "We spent some time trying to find our way to the fortress, climbed up hundreds of steps to find we could not come in because of an event - hundreds of people suffered the same fate that day, all of us asking why there was not a notice at the bottom of the steps - none of us",
          "There is a bit of a climb up a number of steps to this fort but it is worth it as you will be at the highest point of the walls. If you start at Ploce Gate, you encounter this part quite early on (rather than at the end if you start at Pile Gate) and may therefore have a bit",
          "Some of the best photos I took along the Old City walls were taken through the slots in the Minceta Tower.I thought it was well worth the climb.",
          "A lot less people visit this fortress than the city itself, which makes it an ideal place for a great views of the city and surrounding area. Lots of steps to get to the top of the fortress but the views are worth it. It's just a short walk from the city walls to the fortress.",
          "This tower is the highest point in the city. From it's top one can see the entire city below and the sea all around. On a sunny day it is probably one of the most picturesque vistas in Europe, competing head to head with St. Paul's in London and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.",

Pro tip: at most times of day, the fortress will offer some",

          "It's typical that the best views from the City Walls of Dubrovnik come from the highest point which is not that easy to get to given the number of steps you have to climb and is near the end of walking all around the Old Town. To cap it the last small narrow staircase to reach",
          "You come across this fort on the city wall walk, built in 1464 it is worth the climb for the views and the sense of achievement getting to the top. Very tiring but worth it I did think twice about climbing more steps but then thought I might never visit Dubrovnik again and",

          "The most interesting thing about the museum were pictures of the 1990s war (which hasn't anything to do with art). Nice building though.",
          "This art museum is just a short walk from the eastern gate of the old town and we got entry via our Dubrovnik cards. The collection consists of: 1. The first floor houses, 20th century till the present day, modern art of Croatian painters mainly consisting of landscapes,",
          "Very strange. We were staying close to the gallery and are both fond of modern art, so we wanted to visit. We'd read reviews saying no single tickets were available but couldn\u2019t quite believe it, so gave it a try. Nope we were not allowed to buy a single ticket, we didn\u2019t want",
          "This was one of the weirdest ticket counter experiences and a disappointing one. We would have like to visit the museum but a single entrance tickets were not sold. The only options were to buy a museum pass for several Dubrovnik museums (which we didn't want to do as we didn't",

          "This museum is a quick 10 minute walk outside the walls. If you are knowledgeable about modern art do not expect MOMA, the Tate etc. This is a very modest museum, though interesting. A small permanent collection of Croatian art and one special exhibit. A lovely",
          "While you can\u2019t compare it to other museums around the world but i did quite like it because it displays paintings by Croatian painters. The building itself is very nice as well.",
          "We experienced the exhibition of one of the top modernist of Dubrovnik. Really colorful oil on canvas paintings. Most of the paintings were already owned by collectors, so there was no possibility to buy these coloristic pieces of art. I like this museum. There are possibly",
          "The first floor gives a survey of Croatian painting indoors but, like another reviewer, it was the sculpture outside that I really enjoyed - and the wonderful view. But the special Tomo Gusic exhibition on the second and third floors was a revelation. Yes, everything was written",
          "We chose to walk here from the centre of town along the coast road. This was enjoyable in its own right. The gallery and exhibition space was smaller than I was expecting, but definitely worth the walk. The exhibition space is large cool and airy, a welcome relief from the",

          "This palace is incredible, worth checking out for sure. However the art is not in the category of modern overall.. maybe 2-3 pieces are but what is on display is ocean, waves, sunsets with no emotion, no depth. They are straight forward and boring. So go for the building not for",

          "We were not told when buying tickets that the interesting parts of the museum were closed. The old paintings on the first floor were not very special.",
          "One of the best places to visit in Dubrovnik! The museum has a really interesting permanent collection of the croatian artists and temporary exhibitions by international artists, in my case, I had the honour to visit the exhibition by Ahmet Ertu\u011f, and it is really worth it. I",

          "No idea why this place isn't higher up the TA ranking. Be brave and venture outside the city walls, it's not far! Head out of the gate near the port and keep walking for 5-10 mins past the hospital and then the beach club area. Ignore another small modern art gallery on the left",
          "I have visited the Museum of Modern Art as the entrance fee was covered by the 1 day Dubrovnik card I had. This museum is located out of the Old Town, so it took me about 12 minutes on foot to get to it. I was surprised by the size of the museum, its very spacious building. On",
          "Arrived to find that although it is advertised as able to take card payments and you can buy from the shop on card, you cannot buy the tickets with a card! Ridiculous. First floor was not what I class as modern art, and second and third floor were dedicated to ONE artist who we",
          "I did enjoy my visit here, although as others have noted this gallery is not accessible in so many ways, the lack of lifts being prominent amongst them. There are three levels, and plenty of stairs. There is a permanent collection and a changing exhibition (on the top level).",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this rather large gem of a museum. Unclear how it's been open, but the building itself is incredible-- airy, formal and comfortable, uncrowded. If you're looking to escape summer heat and crowds, this is a great option. The collection I saw was all",
          "Great if you could access it. Dubrovnik as a whole is disabled unfriendly. The Gallery is on 3 floors only accessible by stairs no lift. Being Dubrovnik it is incredibly steep. The signage is poor and the staff just disinterested in you. No leaflets about the painting. Good art",
          "Much above expectations. It's a lovely building with a great variety of modern art and a very good portrait collection. The special exhibitions were on par with big city galleries in Europe. The curators of this gallery are to be congratulated.",
          "Now, I like art, and art museums, so it was ok. A little walk outside the city walls and we only went because it was included in the Dubrovnik card, which we didn't feel was value for money, so we wouldn't have paid to go to this separately. The art is good, but the upper floor",
          "Not a large collection, lots of architecture, but very interesting. Some impressive sculpture on the terrace. Included in the Dubrovnik visitor card.",
          "Wandered around this museum (admission is covered by the Dubrovnik card) on the second last day of the trip. Its just beyond the beach as you walk south away from the Old City. Spacious museum that somehow feels 'underused' tbh. Some impressive portraits on floor one, that I",
          "This is a short walk out of the old town, with some lovely views. The museum is in a house built in the 1930s by a shipping magnate, and the architecture is wonderful. A variety of Croatian art is displayed - a bit of a mixed bag, but well worth seeing. Off one of the galleries",
          "A great stop for a day exploring the old city. While the museum is a short walk outside the city walls it has some awesome local art and really stunning views of the city. A great experience and fabulous that you can gain entry w your Dubrovnik card",
          "This place is a little way out of the town centre but worth it for the view of the old town. There is a mixture of paintings, some good, some not what I recognise as art!",
          "More than the paintings themselves (which were decent but didn't particularly stand out), the building was beautiful. An old converted villa, it was amazing to think about what it might have been like to live here. There is even a small section in the back on the 3rd floor",
          "I love art galleries and really enjoyed spending 45 minutes admiring the local Dubrovnik art. I have to admit the artwork felt very dark but given Croatia's recent violent past is understandable. As with most of the museums and galleries in Dubrovnik for me the most impressive",
          "We went along to the gallery as it was 'free' after having had to buy a combined ticket at the Rector's Palace. Overall it was fine, though a whole floor appeared to be closed. However our visit was marred by a particular member of staff's behaviour. She decided to trail my",
          "This is a wonderful house and worth visiting for this alone. However, when you see a few abstract paintings by one single artist, you usually get the picture (excuse the pun!) When you have TWO floors dedicated to one artist (Lada Vlanic) with all of the paintings more or less",
          "The building is lovely. It has 3 floors of art with the special exhibitions upstairs. Its terraces overlook the old town and give excellent photo-opportunities. A ticket costs 100kn but is valid for 9 museums not just the gallery. If you're a student the price tumbles to 25kn!",
          "I loved the building and the way the art was displayed. Don't miss the sculpture garden on the first floor, with its fabulous view looking onto the sea.",
          "I really enjoyed this visit. The building is really great and the art nicely exhibited, unpretentious arrangements with everything given plenty of space. the building as others have said is a real oasis on a stifling hot day. Within minutes walk from the old city east gate, you",
          "Interesting Japanese modern art but some of the other pieces not that modern ? The sculptures were excellent Maybe visit of time to kill",
          "The collection is good. The paintings are ok, and the sculptures are very nice. But the best piece of art is the building itself - and of course the view on Dubrovnik. Must see.",
          "I went there to see the beautiful exhibition of the Dubrovnik born-Zagreb based artist Anabel Zanze. What fantastic experience: beautiful exhibition place, fantastic paintings from contemporary Croatia; wonderful terrace facing Lokrum (a dream!), beautiful architecture and very",
          "As we had a Dubrovnik card which included free entry we decided on a visit to this museum as we usually enjoy modern art. It is a lovely building (a bit further out of the old town than the map suggests), we were not sure about the exhibits to start with as there are mainly",
          "Spread over three floors, this is a lovely building but that's it. The first floor had some paintings from the early 20th century but then there were two floors devoted to a local \"artist\" Anabel Zanze. Her art is simply words, in chosen type face arranged on a canvas. That's",
          "We visited only because it was included in the Dubrovnik card. It is very small, with very little art to see! The view from the terrace is nice but it is quite a hike from the Old Town.",
          "I was a bit wary of visiting this museum after noting that all of its reviewers extolled the views and building and barely commented on the art. I can see why now. There are some lovely permanent pieces (which are not modern), and the rest of the exhibits seem to be by local",
          "The star attraction of this museum is the building. It oozes class. The exhibits when we visited were really quite good and although we only took around an hour to visit it was very worthwhile.",
          "A little out of the way but cool and airy and has an amazing range of paintings and sculptures- it was an oasis in a hot and crowded August Dubrovnik and woefully undervisited by all appearances. Has a fantastic terrace with beautiful views of the city.",
          "This is no Met or Guggenheim...... However what it is .. is a great space to wander through when the heat builds up in the city and a great first experience of post modernism in what is now Croatia. You must visit the Bucan gallery/exhibition on the top floor. Look out for",
          "There were some ok paintings in this museum, but I would not have gone if it was not part of the Dubrovnik card. The exhibit displayed while we were there was not too impressive and I would not go again.",
          "Housed in a beautiful, airy, Renaissance/Gothic mansion with panoramic views of the Adriatic, the Museum of Modern Art was my favorite museum in Dubrovnik, and worth the 10-minute walk outside the Old City. While I didn't care for the current special exhibition--that's just my",
          "We toiled out of the city and stopped at the museum. It was beautifully cool and uncrowded. We loved the local art from the early 20th century, not so keen on the modern temporary exhibition but much enjoyed the sculpture on the terrace and views from it",
          "We bought a three day dubrovnik pass which let's you enter the walls ten public transport trips and entry into museums which the museum of modern art was one. I personally didn't gets anything out of it but then it's really my thing! I like art but not that minimal stuff!!",
          "The museum of Modern Art is a short walk southward from Ploce Gate. The building is a gem, with a great roof terrace where the sculptures vie with the stunning land and seascapes. Inside the paintings sometimes compete for attention with the impressive cast iron banisters! When",
          "Worth a visit to see art both from 2 contemporary artists (that were indeed quite interesting). Had I not gotten entry included as part of the Dubrovnik card k probably would not have gone, but am glad I did due to the beautiful view of the old city and harbor you get",
          "We visited this gallery as one of the attractions available with the Dubrovnik card, and enjoyed the art and sculpture. We came from the relics in the cathedral so the painting of the relics, with arms and legs all over the painting, made a particular impact. The sculptures also",
          "I visited the museum last year when they presented an extensive show of photographs by Steve McCurry. The spaces were lovely and the work well presented. I was impressed with the museum and suggest a visit to anyone interested in art, while visiting Dubrovnik. The walk up the",
          "The gallery itself is a beautiful modern building with fabulous views over the sea, including towards the Old City. On the terrace are a number of mostly indifferent bronze sculptures, rather lacking in any sense of vitality. The permanent exhibition had been replaced by a major",
          "If you are going to visit the museum, make sure it is not a random visit. Find out what is on and if you're not sure then do a quick google to see if it is the type of exhibit you will enjoy. During my visit the Josip Trostmann display was on. Thankfully it will only be on for",
          "Museum is small with only two exhibitions, it's interesting to see some croatian art as i didn't have any knowledge on it but don't expect spending more than an hour. It s located near banje beach and sveti jakov beach so you can go there and then go for a swim. Great view from",
          "We arrived at this beautiful gallery at 7.30pm when it shuts at 8pm, to be met by a very grumpy lady on the front desk, who was clearly unhappy about letting us in at this time. We went in anyway and had the whole place to ourselves, which was wonderful. The best bit is the",
          "I love art Each piece is like a person with its own story to tell If you have a couple of hours to spare & want to keep in from the sunshine for a while relax this is the place to go if you are into art .",
          "This was a very nice museum but we were nearing the end of a 2 week vacation in Croatia. We were getting \"museumed\" out so probably did not appreciate this as much as we might. We had a guide too that spent way to much time on too few pieces.",
          "Gorgeous building, friendly staff, magnificent views across the Adriatic and some amazing sculptures / artwork. Seriously it was worth the 30 kuna entrance fee for all this. They could have some amazing events on the terrace with a bit of investment. Stunning.",
          "As with all museums in Dubrovnik - this was well organised and a worthwhile visit. Good and varied artwork from different artists.",
          "They often feature Croatian modern artists who's work is new to me but very stimulating. The views from the second floor are amazing. They sell posters which are good value.",
          "absolutely beautiful building, clean airy, opens out on a beautiful terrace, interesting american photo exhibition and some drawings could be great with a little injection of money..for brochures , some new art works ,someone to organise travelling collections. could get some",
          "Well displayed exhibitions of photographs and also architect's drawings. gallery is lovely building with great views, and interesting sculpture outside.",
          "I had understood from guide books that this museum showed the work of three modern Croatian painters, but when I visited it was entirely devoted to American photography, which was enjoyable but not what I was expecting.",
          "plenty of space between the art works which was made up of photos in the main - v interesting and nice views of the old town from the terrace - your own photo op.",
          "Just a few hundred meters away from the Ploce gate it's well worth visiting. Just remember it's about modern, not contemporary. At the time, they had stunning photo prints of an American photographer and drawings of an Portuguese architect - both interesting. The entrance fee 30",
          "As a career artist and traveler, I have spent time in museums everywhere. I use the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver as a standard. Unfortunately this one in Dubrovnik feels more traditional than modern. When they noticed me with my iphone, I had someone following me until I",
          "It was certainly worth the walk out of the old town centre to the museum. It is an interesting building just past the city beach. As with all modern art museums, the art won't be to everyone's tastes, but it was certainly interesting. I probably would not have gone if it",
          "Was really impressed by the exhibition, portraits from around the world. The museum is on the hill out of Dubrovnik about a 10 minute walk max.",
          "Unlike most of the museums we visited, the modern art museum did not allow photos inside. The collection was interesting but not memorable. As part of the collection there were war related photos and some additional Mestovic sculptures.",
          "We visited this beautiful art collection as the sun was setting, the outside terraces have a superb view of the old city. The art is very mixed, to us the most moving were the photographs of the bombardment of the city, the last frame being when the young photographer was killed",
          "Wanted to visit on our last morning in Dubrovnik but when we turned up we found that only a special exhibition was on and the main collection wasn't on show. Glad we were told before parting with our 30 kuna. We were able to climb the steps to the sculpture terrace which was",

          "I saw the Steve McCurry exhibition. It was fantastic! Breathtaking photos, including Afghan Girl, showing her 17 years later. There was a video, showing how he did find her after almost 2 decades. Touching. The museum is also a work of art. I reccomend.",
          "I saw the Steve Mc Curry 'Unguarded Moment' exhibition (until 22 July 2012). Around 160 fantastic photos (more than other Mc Curry exhibitions) including his most famous picture - Afghan Girl. There is also the documentary (2002) about his search to find the Afghan girl 17 years",

          "An oasis of peace away from the old town of Dubrovnik. The museum is actually only accessible with a special museum ticket. Tip: if you buy something in the museum shop, you can go in for free ...\n\n",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987.

          "The Bell tower is an important landmark visible from just about everwhere in the city. The bells strike twice at an interval of three minutes. The best views are from the city walls",
          "It is always helpful when you are visiting a city for the first time to have a landmark such as this giving you some idea where you are before you st your bearings.",
          "A bell tower that dominates the old town and whose bells strike twice, on the hour and three minutes later \u2013 just in case you didn\u2019t hear it the first time. There\u2019s two figures, each with hammers, who take it in turn to strike the bell.",
          "Along the way (and over time), there have been a few modifications, one of which was the tower being rebuilt in the 1920's (it was leaning). Up in the bell tower are two figures which hammer the bell to chime the time. These are copies; the originals are in the Rector's Palace",
          "Our family of 5 visited Dubrovnik in July 2016. You can view the bell tower from within the Old Town, while walking the City Walls or from other parts along the coast. A beautiful piece of architecture.",
          "There are internet pages saying this tower has been opened for tourists in 2013. However, it seems to have been closed again. We even asked a local guide for the entrance and he was surprised to find it was no longer available.",

          "Standing tall over Dubrovnik, this structure houses bells that are struck by two figures, twice every hour on the hour. Just like you hitting the snooze, they strike again at 2 minutes past the hour! Then they stike every quarter hour. Watch the pigeons, they have become",
          "You will notice this attractive historic Clock Tower from many locations in and out of the city. None more so than when entering the stradun where you will notice the clock tower at the end of the street. Well worth being around when it chimes on the hour.",

          "The Bell Tower is one of those defining points of the old town and can be spotted from a number of locations around the town. It chimes out multiple times during the day and is lovely to listen to while enjoying the sunshine. While you can get some great views of it from the",

          "Went in a 6pm. The steps are narrow and controlled by a light- if it's green, go in, if it's read, someone is on there way down. It's a mixture of spiral staircase, stone steps and a metal ladder. When you get to the top there is a narrow walkway round the town. Great views.",
          "You cannot mis this tower while you are in the city, at the end of the main street. It has a clock which moved only per 5 minutes, very funny.",

          "The bell tower is a focal point in old town Dubrovnik, and is a lovely example of traditional 15th century architecture! The original bell ringing figures can be viewed in the Rector's Palace if this is something of interest. The bell tower at night is a gorgeous sight not",

          "The Bell Tower is a much photographed symbol of the walled city of Dubrovnik. It stands at the end of the plaza. The chimes were simple and there is nothing about this bell tower that makes it memorable in and of itself",

          "Location: After going through Pile Gate and Stradun, you will see the clock tower at the far end. It is still working as the bells continue to strike by two bell ringers. And the sound is very loud. The architectural is unique and beautifully designed. You can't miss this",

          "You can't not see the bell tower as soon as you come through the Pile Gate and step foot on Stradun. It is at the far end and is very impressive up close. The clock is still working and the bells are struck by two bronze bell ringers (although the original ones are now housed in",
          "Standing 31m high the clock tower is a dominant sight across the town and particularly from the Stradun. At the top you can see the two green figures, called Maro and Baro, who strike the bell. The original figures are in the Rector's Palace.",

          "This is an iconic Dubrovnik landmark and you can't miss it, standing at the end of the main Stradun (mainstreet). You can't go inside or up it (at least, I couldn't work out how) so it's just something to photograph. It looks nice with sunset light casting a glow over it or",

At its top is a large white stone cross and Fort Imperial, a defensive structure built by the French in 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars. Sr\u0111 is popular with tourists as a viewpoint from which it is possible to see the walled city of Dubrovnik, Lokrum island, the Adriatic Sea and various local attractions (including restaurants and the Stradun).\nSr\u0111 was once forested with oak trees which locals called dubrava (from the old Slavic word dub, \"oak tree\"), after which the city of Dubrovnik was named. The southern slope was once rich with pine forests, but in the second half of the 20th century and during the 1991\u201395 Croatian War of Independence, the forest was almost completely gutted through numerous fires. A zigzag Calvary leads up from the town.\nThe mountain was home to one of the fiercest battles of the Independence War, namely the Siege of Dubrovnik, and this is commemorated in a museum in Fort Imperial. The television mast was destroyed by fighter aircraft from the Yugoslav Air Force. The cable car that was disabled during this time has since been reopened, and Sr\u0111 has been developed as a tourist attraction, with a restaurant and a base for buggy safaris.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n200 years of Fort Imperial atop of Mount Sr\u0111",

          "Zdravko took us on an unforgettable tour, which my 8 year called \"epic\"! The trip was informative, relaxed, adventurous, and thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend if you enjoy off roading, stunning scenery, and history. Thank you Z for an amazing safari, and for your awesome",
          "I wish I could remember the name of our driver as he was outstanding. I took this tour with my 23 YO son. It can be a challenge finding something that interests both of us but this was definitely it. I'd highly recommend this.",
          "We booked just 6 hours before and was not sure what\u2019s it gonna be We met at the port of gruz and from there we found 2 buggies waiting for us in port Very friendly staff explained the tour and if we go We went on the bridge port for some pictures then to the water fall then",
          "My husband and 2 boys aged 11 and 13 absolutely loved this activity. Booking was very easy via the website and staff really helpful online with questions I had prior to the activity. Their driver Zdravko arrived on time to collect them from our accommodation and then the fun",
          "We made a last minute decision to do the buggy safari after getting the cable car to the view point. Staff at the kiosk were chatty, polite and friendly and we felt it was really good value. Thoroughly enjoyed our hour off-reading session with various different viewpoints. Great",
          "Highly recommend doing this buggy safari. Me and my boyfriend did it and our tour guide Zdravko was excellent. He offered to take pictures everywhere we stopped. He gave us options on where we wanted to go and gave stories on the history and was able to answer any questions you",
          "We had a great time with Zdravko as our driver/guide/personal photographer. A lovely guy who answered all of our questions and made us feel the perfect balance of safe with excitement!",
          "This was a great way to spend a cloudy morning. We got to see parts surrounding Dubrovnik that we wouldn't have seen otherwise. The buggy was fun. My teenage kids really enjoyed it",
          "This was an unplanned thing when we were at Mount Srd. We heard the roar of the buggies and went to see what it was out of curiosity. And when we realised we could get 20% off using our Dubrovnik Secrets card, we went for it! We drove off road and feasted our eyes on the islands",
          "We booked on this tour having researched a few buggy safaris. This was one where a driver took us out and we did not drive. Our driver was Senco and it was his last tour with the company. He was really good as he listened to where we had already been and took us to different",
          "At the top of the mountain near to the cable car station there is a rocky landscape like you've never seen. This is the playground that along with my sons (18 & 21), we were thrilled to throw our off-road buggies around in. Unlike the bigger guided off-road buggies, these 2-man",
          "At 17.50 we decided to have this experience. So we called the company to see if there was any availability. The woman on the line was very helpful. She called the driver to check and call us back. We were at Gruz port anyway so the driver took us at 18.00. The experience was so",
          "The 'forensic scientist' gave us the 'fast and furious' tour. One of the coolest experiences we've EVER done....Who needs Universal Studios??? I would HIGLY reccomend this unique experience\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "We did this kinda last minute and booked online. The trip was really fun - lots of speed and grumbling engines on the main road. Stopped off at all the main attraction and picture spots - which I was very please with as It went up to the top of the hill (where the cable cars go)",
          "This buggy safari didn't disappoint - we were taken out by our guide (not sure of his name - curly hair), who made conversation, told us a lot about the country, and didn't rush us. The buggies themselves were so fun, and we saw cows, snakes, donkeys. Would definitely recommend",
          "This was by far the best experience we have been on it was fun and got the heart pumping,views were spectacular our guide Zdravko was very professional and knowledgeable",
          "Safe, adrenaline-fuelled fun in the Croatian countryside. Our driver, Zdravko, was so helpful and informative. The highlight of my Dubrovnik holiday so far! Thank you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Such a great experience through the Croatia forest right by the boarder of Bosnia. Absolutely loved it and our guide was great. He even stopped to show us his favourite view over Dubrovnik (see my pictures to have your mind blown). Wish it had lasted longer.",
          "Originally, we were disappointed that we were unable to drive the buggies when I found out a few days before our tour but now I am glad they were driven by the guide because it made it so much better. The narrow and bumpy dirt roads we went down at an exciting speed made for",
          "The Buggy Safari was great for us. Our drivers, Zdravko and Senko, were super fun and very nice. They took us to an amazing viewpoint of Dubrovnik. Thanks for a great tour!",
          "Had a very nice tour with our guide Zdravko, who showed us some beautiful places in Dubrovnik. You get to see some amazing views on this tour. He was really helpful and was so kind to drop us of at our hotel at the end of our tour. Would recommend this tour if you are in",
          "We didnt get to drive ourselves, but this wasn't a problem for us, since our guide Zdravko (\"Z\") was an excellent driver who knows how far he could push it and where to take it easy. This made it exciting while still feeling safe all the time, even at high speeds",
          "Paid for the groups safari but were lucky enough to be the only ones on the tour for that time slot that day. Our tour guide was there promptly before the start time and had plenty of water for us upon arrival Saw a good mixture of town driving, off road and most importantly",
          "We booked the premium tour with Buggy Safari Dubrovnik and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Croatia ! Our guide Zdravko was so friendly and informative and took us to the most interesting spots. He was very helpful with taking photos for us too! I would highly",
          "We spent 7 days in Dubrovnik for my son\u2019s tennis camp and last minute decided to do the buggy ride. This was the most memorable and fun thing we did. However, it wouldnt have been possible if it wasn\u2019t for Niko & Zdravo. They went out of their way to make it fun for us. Hvala !",
          "An exhilarating start to the day! Our tour guide and driver, Zdravko was brilliant throughout. Made conversation to make you feel welcome and was very informative about the different viewpoints and about Dubrovnik in general. We were very happy to have him as our tour guide and",
          "Great experience and got to see some hidden gems of Dubrovnik, our tour guide Zoravko was really lovely and helpful. I would recommend to do this whilst visiting Dubrovnik.",
          "I decided I wanted to do the buggy tour with my sister on my birthday and it was a great decision! Z, our guide, was a lovely and very knowledgeable guy. I felt safe at all times and he let us stop anywhere we wanted to take pictures, even taking pictures of the both of us!",
          "The rain was holding off and the guys picked us up from the old town car park. The route was on the main road up to the mountain, then off road. It was cold wet and windy, and I didn\u2019t stop smiling, excellent outing, what rain! The guys were really polite, knew their stuff and",
          "Buggy safari is excellent. We loved it. I lost my phone half way through and the instructor zdravko took us around the track again to find it. Very nice people and great fun!!",
          "My friend and I did the buggy safari yesterday and it has been the best part, of an already fantastic holiday! It latest around an hour, helmets and plastic ponchos are provided... I now know why! lol Zdravko was our driver, he had us laughing from start to finish and made the",
          "Took a taxi up to the mountain as the Cable Car was not running - took about 20 minutes so give yourself time.. This was such a fun activity. Tour guide was great fun, views were amazing from up the mountain. Great way to pass an hour.. I booked this through TripAdvisor itself",
          "I\u2019m going to start by saying\u201d this was fun \u201c! Despite the torrential rain which I feel added something different. When you in a buggy getting up to 60 kph across terrain then you feel you are going 100 kph. The driver was good, my only minimal issues 1, Wish I could have driven",
          "Zdravko was a fantastic guide. You can chose fast or slow. We chose fast cause we felt like adrenaline junkies. Saw snakes, cattle and beautiful Dubrovnik from above. Excellent photo ops too.",
          "Great experience! Would highly recommend it!! Giving Vito our tour guide 5 stars! Was one of the best experiences ever.",
          "Great activity, highly recommend! We turned up at the Mount Srdj by the cable car we discovered these guys and decided to go - it looked like so much fun! There is a choice of 2 or 4 seater buggy, you can drive yourself or be drives by a guide. You go in a group and follow a",
          "This was an amazing experience. We pre-booked which is highly recommended. The kids loved it too! Great guide 3 stops along the way, for photos and a quick talk from the guide about what you can see and some of the Croatian history. I\u2019d do this again as it really was",
          "We went there with 2 friends and none of us had ever driven a buggy, still it was very easy to ride and we had a lot of fun. As we drove with 3 person in 2 buggys, 2 people had to change seats half way. For them the tour was a bit short. Our guide Tony was very nice and funny.",
          "Having taken in the amazing Old Town of Dubrovnik, the beautiful harbor town of Cavtat & Herceg Novi in Montenegro we needed a little break, this was it! Booked on a whim, we hoped it was something that Mum & Dad would enjoy as well as our hard to please tween son & our",
          "We went on a Buggy Safari Tour today och it was an amazing experience with a beautiful scenery. Apart from the safari itself we also had a great guide named Zdravko who in addition to the tour, also gave us interesting facts about Dubrovnik and the war. Thanks Zdravko!",
          "Our guides were delightful. My sister, husband and I went together and had an awesome time of it. We got to drive our own buggies and follow the guide. The guide kept a good pace so that we could really enjoy ourselves. We went when it had been raining and therefore there",
          "My friends and I were visiting Dubrovnik for the weekend and wanted to experience both the views and go on a little adventure. We took the gondola to the top of the mountain and stumbled upon the Buggy Safari hut and were intrigued. The 5 of us went on the expedition along with",
          "We had such a laugh in the buggy safari, it was fantastic! Me and my husband went in one buddy and swapped round half way through. The track was great and you stop at some interesting and also very scenic points for photo stops. If you\u2019re thinking about whether to do it, don\u2019t,",
          "Buggy safari was alot of fun, the sights were georgous at the top of the mountain, staff is very nice.",
          "Strolling the streets of Old Town are pretty nice, but this was a pretty fun. In addition to racing around on these, our guide also provided a lot of historical information. We had a little hiccup with them putting us down for the wrong time. We weren't sure if we were going to",
          "We stopped here for a cruise, and booked this buggy ride over the phone. They did mess up our reservation, and put us down for a different time, but they were able to get another buggy so we could go on time. It was a lot cheaper than booking through the cruise line. I think we",
          "Having been to Dubrovnik in the past we were looking for an excursion that would take us away form the crowds. Heading up the cable car for the obligatory view over Dubronik we stubbled across a group just coming back on Buggy Safari all dusty and wind swept but looking like",
          "Harvey our guide was fab and offered to take our pictures with the stunning views behind us. Thoroughly enjoyable experience! Don\u2019t forget to dust off when you finish!",
          "Good fun. Fairly full on driving experience. If you are a little timid when driving perhaps not fulor you. Foot down, bumpy, dusty, and fast if you push it. We got 60kph out of our buggy. The guided element quite interesting. And a few great views of the city. Note. If you",
          "If you like us just want a different experience then do it! We had not planned this and as such being a spur of the moment decision we were not dressed appropriately but hey clothes wash! Good fun driving experience, and viewpoint was interesting.",
          "Hrvoje was a great guide. He was very helpful and made sure we were given all the safety instructions. He was very informative at the stops and was very passionate about his cou try and it's history. We got very dusty but it was lots of fun....take something to put over your",
          "A great experience but a wee bit expensive for what turned out to be a less than one-hour tour. Our Guide was good and happy to take photos and provide us with information on the sights as we stopped on the tour. Very bumpy and dusty but exhilirating. Thankfully at the end",
          "I did the buggy experience with my friends. Buggys in very poor condition - many have no side mirrors, no handbrake, brakes not effective, many seatbelts not functional. The lady at reception and the manager were very friendly and assisted us well, however there was one staff",
          "A great way to see stunning panoramic views of the whole of Dubrovnik and Elaphiti islands (on a clear day!) Our guide, Harvey, was very helpful and gave a good briefing beforehand. Harvey was very knowledgeable and passionate about the history of the area and his country, it",
          "Hi my wife & myself took this tour brilliant fun the guide that we went with was Niko very interesting lad and very informative well done Niko. We stopped twice and looked round and the views were Spectacular I would recommend this tour to anybody",

          "This was a fun off road buggy ride. It is very dusty, very rough terrain and a bit of a bone shaker, which made me laugh. The guide was engaging and happy to answer historical questions. The view over the port is stunning. Would recommend you wear a scarf to cover your nose and",
          "The \u201cscenic\u201d buggy ride is a one hour chase behind a guide on a very rocky, bumpy, dusty hillside in an ATV. There is only one stop in a scenic location, overlooking Dubrovnik\u2019s larger port for cruise ships. You can easily walk to this same location for the view from the top",
          "Harvey was such an amazing guide, he explained the history of Croatia and what happened on the hills very nicely. We strongly recommend this activity",
          "I just took the cable car up to the top for a view and stumbled upon Harvey, Kevo and Johnny. The tour was awesome and I had a blast plus they gave me an important history lesson in a boat Dubrovnik. One of the highlights of my Croatian adventure.",
          "An excellent trip where you get to drive the buggy on a combination of on road and off road terrain plus an area of purpose built dirt track which is pure fun Excellent guide and interesting visit to an old fort Stunning views over the city",
          "For something different we decided to to do the buggy safari and we thoroughly enjoyed it as an alternative to the water sport activities. Our guide Robert was friendly and approachable. By the time we added up the safety briefing and the two stops (fort and view of the city)",
          "We booked the tour with high hopes after reading other reviews and it did not disappoint!! The views were incredible and the guide was really informative and friendly. We absolutely loved it and both said it\u2019s one of our favourite experiences from our holiday in Dubrovnik! Would",
          "This was so much fun! Harvey was our guide. He was great! He took us on an awesome trip, stopped at lookout points for us to take pictures and took a nice group picture for us. We also got to see a memorial from the war and he was kind enough to give us some history on the",
          "We visited the buggies at the upper cable car station and started our adventure at around 6PM. If you're doing a flying visit to Dubrovnik and want to cram as much into your trip as possible doing the cable car and buggies together is a great way to tick things off your list.",
          "Did this on an afternoon. Excellent fun with a very knowledgeable and easy-to-get-along with guide. Hit 50km at one point, mostly around 20-25 for those concerned about such things. Don't do what I did and wear white clothes though, as you will get muddy despite their offering",
          "We had so much fun on theis buggy safari. Would definitely recommend you wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty, a bandanna also as you might eat some dust. Spectacular view from the top of the mountain of new dubrovnik and personally the tracks were really fun. Honestly",
          "Firstly the good stuff. Our guide was very friendly and safety briefing was good. They provided masks and hair cover possibly due to previous reviews. The views our outstanding and a good photo opportunity Now the bad stuff. As previously stated this is not 1 hour. It's 30",
          "This was the beat buggy experienice I have ever had and I have had many. Full hour of driving off road and guide was fantastic. Would highly recommend.",
          "Our guide was good, the buggies were great fun to ride, the tracks and routes were fun too. Two things were poor (1) the experience was supposed to be an hour and it finished after 40 minutes and (2) the staff at the meeting point cabin were pretty unfriendly and disinterested",
          "My husband and I had such a fun time on the Buggy Safari! All the staff/guides were great and very knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this if visiting Dubrovnik. Just a few helpful hints: 1. make sure you head there with enough time to make it up there via cable car.",
          "Ok... without a doubt the best 1hr of our trip. We dealt with a fair amount of tourist-centric companies in and around Dubrovnik and Veto (I hope I\u2019m spelling your name right!) was the most engaging and outgoing person we dealt with, by far. We did the sunset ride and I",
          "I hated it although the others I was with thought it ok and had some fun. This lasts only one hr. the steering of the buggies was dreadful and there was little time given to get use to the driving. Unsurprisingly I crashed and then when we stopped one of the instructors instead",
          "This was a lot of fun, just way too short. Like others have said, you will get very dirty! We weren\u2019t given face masks, so bring a bandanna or something to cover your face or you will be coughing up dust the rest of the day. \ud83d\ude00 We didn\u2019t take this tour for the guide. We",
          "Great time with our teenagers driving around the mountains behind Dubrovnik. This was truly more of a Safari than anything else as we drove around for an hour on trails that wound through the hills. Depending on the speed you end up doing a couple of laps instead of one long",
          "Nice contrast to the culture of Dubrovnik. Good fun, though route doubles back on itself making it seem a bit shorter than it could have been - perhaps an extra 30 mins would make it really good. Guide was lovely - kept us together and picked great places to stop for the",
          "The buggy safari s located at the top of the cable car ands lasts around an hour. Take heed of the advice to wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty, this is off-road on dusty tracks. On arriving you are given hair net, helmet and the option of face mask and safety specs -",
          "This was so much fun !! I went in the passenger seat with my dad and it was amazing They had masks goggles and hats to keep you safe from the dust and our guide was very chatty and friendly Thoroughly enjoyed this experience!!",
          "Booked this through our tour group. Waste of time. Most of the buggys were out of action , you only get about 15 minutes of driving time, with no guidance or explanation of the history or area. Definitely overpriced for $65. Transport up there was a nightmare too with the",
          "Wow! This is so much fun. right next to the cable car so dead easy to find. Did this as a family so our 18 yr old drove one and a 12 yr old girl as passenger in the other. The kids loved it, the buggys were so easy to drive, full harness so all strapped in safely, The guide",
          "We happened upon this place when we took the cable car up the mountain and I'm so glad we did! We had so much fun on our 1 hour ride. Our guide was really funny, easy going, and attentive to us. The staff provided us with hairnets, face masks and glasses to protect us from the",
          "The buggy adventures is amazing and totally worth every penny! My friends and I were so happy we decided to rent the buggy\u2019s for an hour and only pay 300 kuna each instead of renting a jet ski for 30 minutes for 600 kuna. The buggy\u2019s were a blast! The views were incredible,",
          "The best thing I\u2019ve done in Dubrovnik!! Absolutely to do!! So funny and at the end they also gave us cold water and soap to clean us!",
          "Me and my girlfriend did this on our vacation. It was an amazing experience. So much fun, beauty mixed with action. We recommend doing with just before the sunset so that you get the most perfekt view of the landscape. Thank, we had a great time!! Marius & Ida",
          "Enjoyed a fantastic off road tour with our guide, Luca Grubi\u0161i\u0107. All staff polite and the tour was great fun with stunning views of Dubrovnik and the mountains on the other side. I would recommend this to anyone.",
          "Well what can I say, the experience itself was absolutely delightful and the views are breath-taking. So glad me and my friends did this. I would recommend it to all. Price is normal and worth every penny in my opinion! As for the advice, wear your old clothes because it does",
          "Myself and my friend had such a great time during the buggy safari. Just couple of points to mention : go with your sun glasses and old clothes as you will be covered in dust/sand during your ride. Try to go 15/20 mins before the ride. The crew is quite friendly and it\u2019s worth",
          "So glad we decided to do the buggy safari!! It was an incredible experience and something we will never forget. The staff are friendly and explained things well. One thing to mention is that the buggy's are quite hard to drive- even if you are a competent driver. Despite this",
          "Really fun experience, with a beautiful view over Dubrovnik. This is a fun and different activity in Dubrovnik, and the guide Harvey was great, patient and sweet. I would definitely recommend this. Thanks for the experience",
          "So so brilliant! Our guide was great and explained a few things to us. Also you get to see some incredible sights a lot of tourists will not see and get to race around in your own buggy! We went quite early so actually ended up having our own private tour!!",
          "My husband and I did the buggy safari on 23.7.18. We deliberately chose that date as the weather was forecast to be overcast with the chance of a storm. The minute we got there the heavens opened and the first half of our buggy safari was in torrential rain. I can only say that",
          "It was so cool to drive around with a buggy high above Dubrovnik. Seeing the wildlife and enjoy a rumbling tour through the hills. To summarize it: pure fun. Very nice stuff and you really felt they love driving buggies trough rocks and dust. The viewpoint over Dubrovnik was",
          "This was such a fun excursion! Nicko was our guide and definitely gave us a great dirt filled tour! He was also a GREAT photographer for our large group of 8 \ud83d\ude02 he was super informative and was very knowledgeable. I would suggest saving this tour for towards the end of your day,",
          "turned up with my 2 children (14/11). my eldest joined the guide in the front (saved her getting super dusty too). the team was super cool. flexible, fun and easy going. recommend getting a break from the busy Old Town. Plenty of fresh air on the top. and then plenty of sandy",
          "This was so much fun but too short! We thought we were going again and then we were back where we started! If you go with another person both of you can drive. It\u2019s super dusty so don\u2019t forget your glasses and if you have a bandana bring it and cover your mouth cause when",

          "We enjoyed the buggy safari however it did have a few negatives. It's based at the top of mount srdj so you need to either hike up and  back down afterwards, or fork out 150 kunar each for round trip tickets. Our go was booked for 10am. We got there early expecting to get",
          "As per the title myself and three friends rented a buggy each and had the best hours Craic. Our guide was a really nice lad and the rain only added to the fun so long as you don\u2019t mind mud.",
          "Booked this for 4 of us for a fathers day treat for my father-in-law - was not disappointed! Hilarious driving round, getting covered in dust, driving through muddy puddles and taking in the most beautiful scenery and views! Well worth a go!! Please ensure you wear old clothes",
          "The buggy safari was a ton of fun, but could have been improved with some goggles. We also did not know just how muddy it would get when it rained and so without a poncho my husband ruined his shirt and shorts with the mud. Still, all in all it was a good time and good fun.",
          "Had a great time riding the buggies on the mountain. We saw some wild life, learned some history about Dubrovnik, and saw a great view! Also didn't hurt that our guide Vito was adorable\ud83d\ude01",
          "Such a great way to see Dubrovnik from above! Lots and lots of fun with the best tour guides, Niko and Luka! Definitely would recommend this safari.",
          "We enjoyed our buggy but the flyer was a little miss leading as the flyer says 300kuna per person but you are unable to pay that price if you are going in a buggy by yourself. Our guides were good and made sure everyone was safe. If you are looking for a thrill you may not love",
          "It was with a little trepidation I agreed to this activity having never done it before. wow! How glad I am I did. The buggy\u2019s were easy to drive and we were given clear instructions by our guide. It was really fun and the views were great. We had two stops where our guide gave",
          "What great fun we had here. Luckily there was only a vert small group. We had such a fun time and the setting is stupendous. The best money we\u2019ve spent in ages .",
          "So much fun. A must when visiting Dubrovnik. Took some fantastic photos of the city as well as the wild life. Would recommend to a friend.",
          "I wish I could rate this higher and really wanted to love it as all the other reviews were fantastic. The activity has all the makings to be great - some views, interesting history and a good duration but it just wasn't that interesting. You could get the views doing your own",
          "Must do experience in my book. We booked two buggies for the four of us and you can swap drivers half way round after the photo stop. It was very dry when we went so you get covered in dust - after rain you would be caked in mud! It\u2019s not a cheap trip at 300kn each but well",
          "Recently visited Dubrovnik and wanted to try the buggy safari as something different to do, and was in no way disappointing! The route we took around the mountains was beautiful. The tour guide was very helpful and on a short stop we made on the tour he gave us a short history",
          "We planned buggy safari for the day of arrival. We took the cable car to the top of the mountain and the buggy safari began immediately on the top. The safari was excellent fun. It was a good mix of driving along a dirt track, stopping for photos and off-roading. You get dirt in",
          "Great fun if a bit muddy after rain. Guide very friendly and fun. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Amazing ride, had the time of my life! It was thrilling but not too scary. Definitely much more fun than the cable car and offered some great views! Worth the price",
          "The activity was good but was quite expensive for what you got. We had an issue with our buggy and the brakes failed as we were going down hill which was a bit scary. Luckily with my husbands good driving skills he managed to manoeuvre it so we came to a halt against some",
          "If you visit a Dubrovnik walls the next destination for you is buggy. The great time for friends and couples. It is not expensive. You can find about a Dubrovnik history with great guide. I am honour what i have a luck and visit buggy",
          "This was a real fun side trip for us, we really enjoyed the ride! Take your buff, and glasses, expect a little dust. There is a washroom there where you can clean up and go about your day after. Our guide, Nickola, was super informative, we especially liked the memorial he",
          "Really good fun and you get the chance to take some really great photos of the town and the near by islands in the sea. The tour guy was really funny and gave us some history about dubrovnik which was interesting.",
          "A fantasticly well organised must-do part of visiting Dubrovnik if you want to see it from a different aspect. The staff are all very friendly and demonstrate exactly how the buggies (automatics) work. The guide stops off at various points on the tour for photo ops and brief",
          "Hubby and I took an afternoon buggy safari tour together. It was an absolute blast - we loved it and laughed the whole way around bouncing over the hills & rocks. Passed plenty of butterfly's, cows & even some donkeys. We got to stop at two viewing points & the guide took",

          "This is something different to do while in Dubrovnik. I have booked a solo buggy and we where in a group of 4 buggies in total. We drove around through some rough terrain and stopped and 2 different points of interests that oversee the city below. The tour guide was very",

          "The buggy Safari takes place on the hill overlooking Old Town. You can take the lift up and it\u2019s right behind the building. The tour is a quick 1hr. You get on the mud soaked buggy and drive off down a dusty road. Prepare to get dirt in your face. Bring a buff if you have",
          "The buggy adventure was fabulous from the very start... staff were friendly and very funny especially vinko he was brilliant and told very interesting stories about Dubrovnik!!",
          "Can't fault it in anyway. Made for a really good afternoon and something a little different from the norm! The buggy's are in good condition and powerful and are really fun to drive around, plus you get a chance to get off the beaten track. Tour guide was excellent aswel.",

          "This experience is a must! It was a rainy day but it made it even more fun. Victor our guide was fantastic, he made it fun and educational going through the history of Dubrovnik. Don\u2019t miss out, the views are breathtaking and the ride through the mountains are worth it. Ana and",
          "Honestly this was one of the highlights of my trip. Our guide was great and gave us a bit of history around the troubles in the 90's and showed us some parts from the war. If you are in Dubrovnik then do this! - you won't regret it",

          "Must do in Dubrovnik had a great time on this hour long buggy trail. You stop at a few different places to soak some history. Also Matt and Vinko were great really funny had me laughing all the way through. It\u2019s about \u00a330 per person.",

          "Vinko was my guide; he was awesome - he gave me confidence to do this and as I improved my skill, he picked up the pace so that by the end of the hour - I was definitely up to speed. We saw some beautiful sights, some tragic and poignant moments with the memorial and knowing",
          "Visited at the end of April and had a great experience. We booked our tickets the day prior at the bottom of the mountain at the cable cart ticket booth (to save paying to go up in the cable cart just to book the tickets). We went on the 2pm tour and there were only three of us.",
          "What an amazing experience I highly recommend anyone to do this. The tour is a great way to see Dubrovnik with fantastic views and the tour guides are funny and very charming! Do wear clothes you don\u2019t mind getting dirty as it is quite dusty and muddy.",

          "This was by far the highlight of our holiday once we got past all the 'possible death' mentions. You will get muddy so dress appropriately but ponchos are provided. The guide was great really helpful (very useful for me as I seemed to have trouble starting the buggy)and",

          "Gave it 5 stars because the guide said if I didn't he has my address and would come and find me!......only joking, great guide, awesome views, also our guide gave us loads of tips on best places to eat and stay in Dubrovnik. Highly recommend, especially couped with cable car",
          "Approached a staff member who was part of 'Buggy Dubrovnik' asking if there was space available for the next ride and we were told a flat no, even though online it said two buggys were still available. After reading the reviews beforehand we were expecting great things,",

          "We both thoroughly enjoyed the buggy safari. We booked direct at the top having arrived by the cable car. Would suggest booking in advance to avoid disappointment as this tour sells out fast. Luckily we managed to get the last slot for 1pm but the next one was not available",
          "We had a great time and were so well looked after by our guide Tommy. Big shout out Tommy! Good driving and a history/culture/geography lesson on the stop part way round. More seesaws please (you'll understand when you do it). Girls should accept a poncho. Guys...man up!",
          "We walked up Srdj to get to the buggies, took us about 45 minutes but this was before the heat of the day; it's a nice walk. The buggies were a great experience with a funny guide and good group size. Slight negatives: ordered through TripAdvisor and the tour guides didn't",

          "After being skeptical of booking a dodgy excursion whilst in Croatia, we decided to take the plunge and try something new. We rang the number from the website the day before to book our reservation for the 10am buggy safari. We were not disappointed! We were greeted by a",
          "This buggy safari was so much fun! You get to drive the buggy yourself...two passengers in each one. Be sure to wear clothes that can get dusty, because--believe me--you will come out covered with dust! The designers of the trail have put in some neat dips and curves, including",
          "We booked this activity easily using Buggy Safari Dubrovnik's website before heading out to Dubrovnik and just took our voucher with us on the day. Tours depart from the top of Srd Hill near the exit of the upper cable car station and seemed to run regularly. The trip itself",
          "The drive was a lot of fun and our tour guide Vito was really cool! We decided to go to one of the early tours, so there were only us and two other people, which meant we did not need to wait for many vehicles to be ready etc. The view of the old city from up there is",
          "It was as expect. Very good. We had the main man, Big V guiding us, he was funny, charismatic, a local celebrity of what a little bit sweary at times. We would definitely come again.",
          "If you are up for it, this is so much fun and you get dirty and get to see a great view of the city... but the cable car is crazy pricey, and also getting a taxi to get to it from our cruise was another huge cost... for 2 adults and 2 teens spending over $150 in transportation",
          "We spent 5 nights in Dubrovnik. Not a bad price but this was just ok. You follow in a line behind every one else at a very moderate speed. There is no challenge or thrill to the drive. The view was spectacular- but that was about it. If you have a lot of time in the city i",
          "This was lots of fun! However, very dusty so prepare to be covered in a thick layer of dust!! Very good guide but could maybe spend a little more time explaining how to use the buggy and maybe have a little practice around the car park before driving on the track. I would",
          "You buy tickets for this at a kiosk outside the upper cable car station on Srd Hill. The buggies are open two-seaters with automatic transmission - very easy to drive. If you can't decide who should drive, there are stops along the way where you can swap over! The 'safari' set",
          "We came by cable car at the mountain Sr\u0111 above Dubrovnik for sightseeing and saw the buggy safari. It is about 1 hour off road ride in small buggy cars (2 persons per car). You receive a helmet and sunglasses. Do not expect to see animals during this \"safari\". It is easy to",

          "It's quite a fun trip, but safari it isn't, though we did see a domestic cow. You basically get on a 2 seater buggy, which is fun to drive, but not as much fun as quads as it's heavy and relatively unresponsive. You go along a dust track with a couple of stops with OK views, but",

          "My family and I had a great time on the buggy safari. We found it online before we came to the city and made a reservation. My dad was conserned it would be a slow boring tourist trip but he was wrong! There was high speed corners and big hills to climb and we all had a blast!",
          "This was the most fun I had during my week in Croatia. Time behind the wheel is close to 30 minutes. We had two stops to hear our awesome guide talk about local history and describe the ruins we visited near the path. The whole experience was about 45 minutes. The Buggies were",
          "The buggy was driven by my husband, who had troubles at times with the dust in his eyes, as they do not provide goggles, luckily we had sunglasses. It was basically a tour of the top of Dubrovnik with a small historical lesson of the civil war (which we liked being history",
          "We had such a great time! At first we were annoyed that we had to buy the ticket for the cable car extra (it's a tad extensive) but when we were up there, driving around with this fantastic view it was all worth it. We even saw a cow, a mule and some horses running around freely",
          "If you are heading to Dubrovnik, I highly recommend that you book up for the buggy safari. We were based just outside of the range for hotel pick-up Lapad so had to meet our pick-up at Gruz Port. However, it turns out our pick-up left without us as another couple decided book up",
          "Great fun-went on the 7pm tour, so we managed to catch the sun setting over Dubrovnik. The tour commences at the top of the cable car station, and you're given a full safety briefing before speeding down a dust trail at 30 - 40 km/h. Our guide was Vito, who kept everyone",
          "The buggy safari was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! I would recommend going on the latest one of the day as you get amazing views of the sunset. Our guide Johnny had a great balance of fun and history when talking to us and kept the group both entertained and",

          "Best view of Dubrovnik from the top of the hill where the cable car is. This is where you begin the Buggy adventure. Unfortunately you have to either purchase a cable car ticket or like us get a taxi (or uber) it was much faster as no waiting in ques. The buggy was easy to",
          "The buggy experience was great and most of the route was very scenic. The organisers are a good lot of people and make this activity a lot of fun. I just wish the buggies were in better condition! They are Chinese and the organisers clearly tell us that, but the brakes were",
          "Was a really fun morning for the adults and the kids. Amazing views of Dubrovnik and very helpful team. Lots of fun!",
          "I never knew being covered in dust could be such a blast. The automatic ATVs are easy to drive and will go as fast a you want to push them. If you love outdoor adventures this is a must. However, I suggest you wear your sunglasses to protect your eyes from the dust. No worries",

          "Great thing to do for a few hours. The guide was such a nice guy, made us laugh and feel calm. We did expect a bit more driving though. We were two people and switched driving halfway, so definitely better to have one buggy yourself.",

          "my husband and I booked the 7-8pm tour hoping to enjoy some sunset views m. Unfortunately, it was hard to enjoy the ride with sooo much dust flying into your face and eyes. There is an easy fix for this, and that would be for the company to invest in helmets with a face shield.",
          "I'd recommend as something to take up time and just enjoy natural dubrovnik and its country side. The tour guides were very fun and easy going. Easy to drive and they take care of everything. Very fun and would 10/10 do it all over again.",
          "Myself & my girlfriend went here one morning, staff were 100% very nice people, we got ripped off in a taxi though we got it from the old town up cost us 250kuna its about a 10/15min drive defo not worth 250kuna should be more like 100kuna so agree a price before you get in OR",
          "Loads of fun. Husband and son went at the back which they loved. They came away filthy but with huge smiles on their faces. Our daughter went at the front with the guide Johnny who they all thought was brilliant. We would heartedly recommend.",

          "Very nice people which helped us very kindly. The trip was around 45 minutes and we drove over off-roud paths and stopped twice. Only thing is that is should have lasted a little bit longer if you ask me",

          "We were hesitant at first about taking the Buggy Safari since we had no idea what to expect, but probably one of the best decisions we ended up making on this trip in Croatia. Be prepared to get covered in dust, but totally worth it and a memorable experience you will have.",
          "The buggies were just awesome and we loved it. We were lucky to have a small group. Not only we did all the rides through the terrain and enjoyed the views of the mountains, we also had two stops where the tour guide Vito told us some stories about Dubrovnik. The sights and fun",
          "Had good laughs and a mouthful of dust!! But part of the experience. Just take a scarf to cover your nose and mouth and dont wear white. You'll definitely need a shower after this adventure. Thank you buggy Safari \ud83d\ude06",
          "It's dusty, bumpy, hot but some of the best fun to be had in Dubrovnik. We have done jeep safaris on other holidays abroad but getting to drive your own buggy is so much more fun. Myself and my fianc\u00e9e decided to have a buggy each to stop any arguments about who got to drive",

          "We stumbled across this while looking at the cable car website and decided to book. It was so much fun. The guides were really helpful and got the balance spot on between safety and allowing you the freedom to enjoy buggying. It lasts for an hour but feels like a minute. I",
          "The one hour ride with the buggy safari team was the best time spent in dubrovnik. We drove upto the starting buggy station enjoying some breathtaking views of old Town dubrovnik on our way up. But there were more breathtaking moments waiting for us once we got behind the wheel",

          "From start to finish, this was excellent fun. Pick up from our hotel. We had great service from our brilliant guide, Miko, who couldn't have been more helpful. I would recommend taking a change of clothes as you freaky do get caked in orange dust but it's worth it.",
          "Myself and the little lady decided to take the cable car up to get a mountain top view of Dubrovnik and the Old Town. I managed to have a look towards the mountains and spotted the buggies - sold. We couldn't have asked for any more from Johnny - top man as we both had a",

          "Having owning buggies at home my girlfriend and I were excited by this adventure in Croatia. The company were fabulous, views spectacular, and route itself good. The tour itself seemed to be to just fill time e.g. Visiting a farm. Would have prefer more time riding buggies. The",

          "I had such an awesome time on the buggy safari. I have never laughed so much! Johnny our instructor was great he made the safari funny and interesting. He had the patience of a saint and would always come back for us if we managed to stop the buggy from moving haha. Must do",
          "Let me start by saying I never write reviews on here, the Buggy Safari was that incredible I felt that I just had to tell people about it. Our host Johnny was absolutely awesome, superb knowledge of the history of the sights seen and a all round great guy. We were given a talk",
          "We booked a sunset tour at one of the booth on Lapad beach with hotel pickup / drop off. The driver arrived on time at 6:30pm and took us to the top of the cable car station. Registration was really easy and rep was helpful. As for the buggy, I'm not a confident driver but it",

          "Our NCL cruise stopped at the port of Dubrovnik, and we took the cable car up the mountain. The desk for Buggy Safari is behind the top cable car station. The terrain was suitable for all ages. If you're a thriller seeker, you might not enjoy it as much. We had a lot of fun. We",
          "The buggy Safari is a must when visiting Dubrovnik! The best views and historic information :) and great fun to drive off road",
          "I did the Sunset tour with a group of 4 girlfriends - great way to see the awesome views of Dubrovnik. A friend recommended this activity while staying in the city and we couldn't have been happier to to follow her advise! Stop at the Panorama Cafe after for dinner - but be sure",
          "Cool experience, beautiful view from the top of the mountain. It started to rain quite heavily, but we just kept going a bit faster and it was great. Lovely staff as well, which always helps!",
          "Its \u00a323 per person in two person buggies, I don't think there's anything in Dubrovnik that's better value for money! the guides Jonny and Dominic were brilliant and spoke good English, funny and full of information. the buggy's are amazing fun and I would recommend to anyone",
          "As a family who likes to adventure we were expecting a bit of a thrill, but this trip was neither thrilling or adventurous. You drive very slowly along a dirt track following the driver in front. We went up to an old fort/watching tower which gives you a beautiful 360 view to",
          "This was a really good. We were surprised at the impromptu history lesson we were given at our first stop - it was very interesting and sad. Be warned you will get VERY VERY dirty so don't forget to bring a change of clothes or wear old clothes. It's worth bringing something",
          "My friend and I just turned up after our trip on the cable car and we went straight away by ourselves in one buggy with the instructor leading in another. Maybe call ahead if that's why you're going up the cable car, as although they advertise that they leave every hour we were",
          "The ride is an enjoyable experience and you get to know about parts of the history of Dubrovnik. Also we went around 4 pm so we had the luck to ride alone with the guide, which probably made it more fun, since there were some chances to really floor it.",
          "Discovered this when we took he cable car up to the top. We booked on and didn't have long to wait. Was so much fun, we could even swap the driving. Amazing photo point too. Got very dirty from it which didn't realise at the time, so back to our villa to shower after.",
          "Excellent fun for our group of 7 aged 16 to 54 in 4 buggies. Some of our number would like to have gone faster, but as total group numbered 8 buggies plus 2 guide buggies our speed was limited by others in the group (some slowing to take photos of a cow!?) The guide joked that",
          "If you do adventure activities and have some experience with this type of activity this tour is VERY boring. We went with a very large group which means everyone had to drive slowly and wait for others to catch up. The sights are ok but not as impressive as many others in the",
          "This is definitely a must when visiting Dubrovnik! The views you get to see are breath taking and the guides give you a lot of information and history about the city! The tour guide, Johnny, was so lovely and friendly and helpful with things to do around Dubrovnik we wish we had",
          "Weather wasn't great but fortunately we had been to the top of the mountain on a previous visit and enjoyed stunning views in sunnier weather. The wind and rain didn't spoil out fun and our guide was excellent, telling us story of the war with personal insight and emotional",
          "Had a rocking time driving these buggys on a dirt track right next to the cable car station on top of the hill. The track is exiting and you can go fast if the others in your group can keep up. Our guide Johnny did a fantastic job and made sure all of us had a great time.",
          "My 7 yr old daughter had a great time and totally loved it. They take you on the safari to an old war site, a fan and then to a great spot with a beautiful view of dubrovnik and elaphiti islands. It was fun driving an ATV and our guide was very polite. A great activity for kids.",
          "My girlfriend and I decided to do this safari as we were going up the cable car anyway and wanted to see more of the mountain. It was a beautiful and very hot day. Our guide was Dominic, he was super friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable of the local area and it's history.",
          "We decided to do something a little bit different at the end of our cable car journey. We were lucky enough to have a private tour with Johnny. We stopped by several locations and he gave us a brief history and background of the areas. A funny guy and a natural at being a guide",
          "Absolutely loved this! Wasn't really sure what to expect but thought it was something different so worth a try. It was an amazing experience made even more memorable by our fantastic guide Ronato! He made sure everyone was safe and knew exactly what they were doing from the",
          "We had the sunset ride that started at 6 pm. Our guide Johnny was a funny guy and provided us with a lot of information on Dubrovnik and its surroundings. The view along the ride was stunning and the Buggy itself was a lot of fun. U will defenitely get dirty from the dust, so",

          "Having previously been the year before I was not impressed and reluctant to return however my girlfriend was anxious to have a go this year. We booked a day ahead for a 10:00am slot and were offered a free pick up and drop off from our apartment to the event, I however chose to",
          "It was a cloudy day and we were looking for something to do until the sun came out so we tried this buggy activity. You need to get the cable car / bus / taxi to the starting point at the top of the mountain - or they will collect if there is a group but it costs an extra \u20ac10",
          "This was a fun tour which we had read about before coming to Dubrovnik. It was fun and lasted about an hour with 3 stops. We enjoyed it and the tour guide was a nice and told us lots of stories and some history. The views were great as well. It gets very dusty so take",

          "It was only myself doing the buggy, but it was fun with my guide being so informative and as I could see another side of Dubrovnik which is a great thing to do!",
          "Really enjoyed this tour. Our guide was very knowledgable and took time to explain a lot of historic things to us. It also takes you to places you wouldn't normally get to see and the view over the harbour on the third stop is something else. I would recommend this and it's",
          "We did this activity as part of a hen do, some of the girls were quite worried but the chaps running it were so reassuring, friendly and most importantly patient. They ran through all the safety checks and assured us we could stop whenever we wanted. The driver leading the tour",
          "Dune buggying is always fun although this is more of a guided tour type of dune buggying as opposed to rip-roaring through the dessert. If you want to see the beautiful countryside around Dubrovnik and see some interesting views then this is a great way to do it. When we went",
          "This was spur of the moment as we got to the top of the cable car and totally worth it! It was fun,the guide was crazy (funny crazy) and we got some beautiful photos. You will get dirty,so dont wear white like i did or you have to wear a poncho!! Highly recommend it",
          "Great fun roaring around the dusty tracks. You are handed head gear and asked to sign a disclaimer so I was a little worried but I needn't have been. Wear sunglasses as you get very dusty but it was good fun.",
          "We decided to go on this buggy ride on the spur of the moment after riding the cable car up to the top. What a fun surprise it turned out to be. The dune buggy's are great fun to drive and the tour is both informative and fast paced enough that you feel like you are getting a",

          "Top of the cable car, buggy safari goes about every hour, the experience lasted about an hour and 20mins in total. Fantastic, entertaining guides, a good balance of humour and information. Great views too. The cars go no faster than 40 kph, so you do not feel unsafe. Good value",
          "Amazing trip.. Not only fun, scary and exciting all at the same time, but our friendly guide/ photographer Dani also gave us so much interesting history on the country and different places we passed. Finally taking us to the most breathtaking view of the islands and old town",

          "I did this adventure with my wife and we had a tonne of fun. Off road driving in a buggy is a must do when visiting Dubrovnik. The added bonus is the spectacular views from the top. You WILL get dirty so don't wear nice clothes. You can bring a change if you wish,",
          "This was brilliant! We started with a briefing on the buggies and then we were off! We took 3 stops along the way to learn about different things such as history, farming and the most amazing one- the views and information about the smaller islands. The buggies were simple to",
          "We did this after discovering it at the top of the cable car. 240 kuna per person so not bad price. The tour was fun and something really different. Got covered in dust. Glad I wore sunglasses that I would recommend else grit would have been in eyes! Worth a go.",
          "This trip was good value for money in our opinion. Great experience, 1 buggy per couple, convoy of 9 customers with the staff leading and following behind in case of any problems. Great views of the area from the top of the mountain, and the guys leading the trail were very",

          "After deciding to hike the whole way up the mountain in the heat, the buggy safari at the peak just topped it off! At that particular time in the day, my friend and myself were the only too people ready to go on the safari so we got our own personal guide, vlaho! The tour itself",
          "Buggy Safari is something you don\u2019t wanna miss and we convince in that ! Sr\u0111 Hill is the spot where safari takes place. Driving through the hills and fields you will get in touch with nature and clean up your mind while adrenaline boosts in. This was an amazing experience for us",
          "This was a good one hour experience. Guides very pleasant and amusing. Nice to see the countryside area of Dubrovnik a little bit in comparison to the old town. Driving the buggies is good fun but it would be nice to have a little more adventure e.g. This is more off an off road",
          "This is one of the best activities that can be done in dubrovnik. The weather was rainy that day, so we decided to do something else other than sightseeing, and boy was this the best decision! This one hour trip across the wildness surrounding Dubrovnik is a breathtaking trill!",

          "We accompanied a convoy led by guide Kiko, who made an already fantastic tour even better by being personable, funny, and honest about the region's history and politics. You will not find better views of the Elafiti Islands or the surrounding mountains elsewhere in Dubrovnik.",
          "We had our own guide 'Jonny' who was very informative and patient with us, happy to constantly take our picture and gave us plenty of time to take in the magnificent views of Dubrovnik from the top of the mountain we had driven up. The buggies are great fun, we saw wild horses",

          "This is really fun! It is really dusty so don't wear anything nice! By the end my face was covered in dust but well worth it. There were 5 buggies in my group so it was a perfect size. We stopped along the route and the tour guide talked about the sites. For example we stopped",
          "We had booked the buggy safari for today and the member of the staff told us that they would collect us from the place where we booked it. We were asked to be there half an hour before the tour started to give enough time to get to the place. We were there as agreed and were",
          "We decided to do this safari based on previous reviews, it was a great decision! We choose the last tour of the day and got the view the most beautiful sunset over 'grandmas hip'. The ride itself was easy to get the hang of and there where cows/horses and lots of bumps to watch",
          "Old Town is wonderful, but taking a break from strictly historic sites and buzzing around the most scenic spots, high atop the mountain, was the best part of our trip. The views surpassed the cable car, the guide was great, there was still plenty of history to be learned and",
          "Chose this based on the reviews and we weren't disappointed. It's a good idea to combine with the cable car journey, as it starts very close to the top stop. The driving is very fun, and quite easy to get the hang of. The drive is along some dirt tracks. There are a few",
          "Once you go up in the cable car the buggy safari is just outside, nice little tour and some history thrown in about the surrounding areas and dubrovnik in general which was a eye opener to hear what went on. The tour takes about a hour and it is enjoyable, all be it you look",

        "wiki": "Trsteno (Latin: Cannosa, Dalmatian: Canait) is a district of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia, population 237 (2001). It is located on the magistral road between the Ora\u0161ac and Slano.\n\n\n== Trsteno Arboretum ==\n\nTrsteno is most famous for its arboretum, is the oldest arboretum in this part of the world. The arboretum was erected by the local noble family of Gozze in the late 15th century, who requested ship captains to bring back seeds and plants from their travels. The exact start date for the arboretum is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a 15 m span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. It has been the property of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1948, when it was donated. The Arboretum reserves a very special place among the old Ragusan, Dalmatian and Mediterranean parks. It includes a park surrounding the fifteenth century summer residence, which is a monument of garden architecture, and a nineteenth century park at Drvarica.\nThe arboretum passed into Yugoslav state ownership in 1945, and was declared a natural rarity in 1948. Since 1950 it has been managed by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1962 the Arboretum Trsteno was registered in the list of protected natural monuments list as a monument of landscape architecture. The protected area covers around 255,000 square metres.\nTrsteno suffered extensive damage and looting during the Croatian War of Independence when on October 2 and 3rd, 1991, the Yugoslav People's Army launched a series of gunboat and air attacks and set the Arboretum afire, destroying a large part of it, and causing partial damage to the summer residence and the oldest part of the arboretum. The arboretum was further severely damaged in 2000 by a forest fire during a drought, when around 120,000 square metres were lost in fire.\nThe pride of the arboretum, two Oriental Planes located on the central market place of Trsteno, survived both disasters undamaged. They are over 500 years old and are unique specimens of its kind in Europe. The ancient trees are both about 45/60 m tall and their trunks are 5 m in diameter. Within what was once the noble family's country house, there is the oldest Renaissance park in Croatia, designed in 1502, with numerous exotic plants.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the third season and fourth season of the television series Game of Thrones, Trsteno and its Arboretum was used as the setting of the Red Keep palace gardens in King's Landing.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrsteno at the Academy website",

          "I enjoyed my day in Trsteno but I can understand why some people might not. The arboretum is interesting if you like plants and game of thrones, however, It is fairly unsophisticated with basic loos and nowhere to buy a drink or anything to eat. We visited on a lovely sunny day",

          "It is not that large, you can easily do it in 30 to 60 minutes. Sadly the pavilion, well known by all GOT fans, is closed with a chain for \"security reasons\". We suppose that's because the parapet is not high enough. But that doesn't really mean that tourist care about it. We",

          "We had read reviews in our guide book and decided to visit from the other side of Dubrovnik. It was a worthwhile journey and we spent a good long time here on a very warm day. Most of the trees are labelled and the gardens are quite extensive. The quality is not quite up to the",
          "We made a point to stop off here for 1-2hours on our drive from Kotor, Montenegro up to Split following the scenic route 8 adriatic coastal route. We missed the entrance (not well signposted if driving) but ended up parking next to a pretty church with good coastal views and a",
          "These gardens are very serene and offer stunning views. We visited here as part of a Game of Thrones tour out of Dubrovnik, well worth the visit with the tour guide showing various parts of the gardens used for the Kings Landing gardens Access is easy and suitable for all ages.",
          "We caught the bus from cavtat changed at the bus station in Dubrovnik... all very easy & took hour and half The arboretum is nice to amble about in the shade of the trees, there is a nice viewing area out to sea,there is a drinks machine & toilets in the villa. We had noticed",
          "Was recommended to us. Not really into trees and never watched Game of Thrones (one of it's locations) but really enjoyed a quite stroll around the arboretum, beautiful trees, gardens, statues and buildings. There is not a lot of parking but we were there in August and not very",
          "In the heat of August this is an oasis of historic beauty. No noise. No cafe. Just peace. The 500 year old tree with dragon paws (roots) guards the path from the road. It's as well to park on the road as the winding walk down can be difficult to turn round on. Paths are suitable",
          "Lovely grounds, gorgeous views and a feeling of being undiscovered. Easy drive from Dubrovnik. Suitable for all ages as the paths are easy to wander. There's even an old acquaduct. IF you're a GoT fan, you'll recognize a couple of the sets!",
          "Travelled here via uber, despite having never watched GoT. The drive was beautiful and I really enjoyed the scenery. Inside the arboretum, there were some very pleasant things to spot - including a tortoise in the pond! We captured some great photos of the wonderful plants",
          "It rained virtually the whole time we were there. We took shelter often in the few buildings on the grounds or under large trees. Yet we really enjoyed ourselves. The tree identifications are well marked and the grounds are well maintained. The building are a bit rough but not",
          "Visited Trsteno arboretum today. We took the bus from the main bus station in Dubrovnik - suburban buses run on an erratic timetable so you may need to wait a while for the bus. The gardens were lovely - there is a 'renaissance garden' next to the arboretum which is interesting",
          "The arboretum is tucked away, in fact we missed the turning the first time, but is a must see. It is so unexpected to find this wonderful gardens with a beautiful villa, stunning fountain and little paths to wander round. The trees are from all over the world and most are",
          "I believe some of Game of Thrones is filmed here. It's a beautiful spot and definitely worth an hour or more of your time. Don't miss the fountain fed by the aqueduct and the bamboo grove. Beautiful place.",
          "Unfortunately our trip was blighted by rain. Gardens are OK but really nothing special and quite overgrown in places. Best bits were the frogs at the fountain which are quite small but very loud and the huge tree which is not even in the gardens. One hour was enough to see",
          "There is hughe potential for this kind atraction, it is a bit sad that it isn't fully used. But still it is really nice place to relax with family.",
          "We were recommended to visit here as it was one of the filming locations for Game of Thrones. It's a little out of the Old Town so we caught a cab and it took about 20 minutes. The main attraction here was the pond with statue and apart from that there's little else to see apart",
          "Having had a lovely bus journey to the place,what a disappointment! It is a non-event, poor signage, a lot of it unacceptable and locked off and minimal work being done. There is supposed to be 70 acres; we didn't get access to 5!! The guy at reception was unfriendly and the",
          "Great gardens and lovely amd peaceful to visit but you can see everything in under an hour for 40kn. The local bus is only a 20 minute journey from dubrovnik but doesn't travel back very often. Every hour and a half I believe. Make sure you take your camera and don't miss the",
          "What a shame! An unloved garden. Doesn't look as though any gardener has set foot there for ages. Such a disappointment. Actually not worth the 2 busrides to get there ... never mind the return journey and the entrance fee. The church was locked up. The GoT balcony was chained",
          "Besides the propose of the tour is to visit the Arboretum, the best of the ride was the beach. The arboretum is nice, well conserved, has a cool water fountain, but the beach is the top notch!",
          "Hard to get to without a car if you are staying in Dubrovnik.. but we were lucky to get here as part of our Game of Thrones tour. It was a beautiful day and the gardens were not too busy so we felt we had the place to ourselves.Well worth the drive out of town..there is a fee to",
          "We went to visit this garden on our way to Ston and it is a very nice place to walk around, take in the scenery and enjoy nature. (I've been told a scene from Game of Thrones was shot in the garden's balcony)",
          "I know the clue's in the title but everyone seems to rave about this place, including the 'Rough Guide' so we decided to give it a go. There is a local bus from from Dubrovnik bus station which stops in the middle of the village but the stop isn't very obvious and you have to",
          "Beautiful in an unpolished and authentic way. Lovely views, beautiful old buildings. Great for an hour or so wander if you have a car to get here. Atmospheric",
          "What a lovely day trip. The TRSTENO Arboretum was a summer residence and garden built in 1494. It is an easy to reach, two buses, traveling along stunning vistas of the Adriatic coast. The fountain, aqueduct and a mill with an olive-press are worth the visit alone. The fact that",
          "Trsteno is several miles north of Dubrovnik. The taxi drivers at the cruise terminal said they would take 40 US dollars or about 35 Euros to drive three of us there. It wasn't a metered thing, just a verbal agreement before we left. There is also a public bus that goes back",
          "Not too far from Dubrovnik, this peaceful place is worth a visit. It has a nice historic feel to it and good sea views. It doesn't take too long to mooch around, not more than an hour at best. The harbour below is also worth a visit, very quaint.",
          "Great gardens we had limited time there and was December. Longer would be better and with things in bloom would be marvelous . Probably very cool (temperature) in a hot summers day. The coastal drive also most enjoyable, Parking A nightmare.",
          "Not so far from Dubrovnik, it is a sancuary for peace and quiet. This is a garden with a lot of various trees and plants and it is so lovely to see it outside of the crowded Dubrovnik. Look to the see is beautiful.",
          "We came to Trsteno at Sunday at our return back from Dubrovnik and place was open for visitors. That was our first positive impression. They work even at Sunday, out of holiday season (November). We were able to look around and sneak at every corner of this wonderfull place",
          "The arboretum is outside of the city and takes about an hour to get too on a local bus or you could go via a tour There is a lot of unique trees and plants to see Some of the scenes from Games of Thrones were filmed here so Die hard fans may want to see the location There",
          "It offers you a really nice peaceful vibe and view. You can have island and sea vibe on the other side and at the other place nice and quiet foresty vibe. It's really worth to visit",
          "If you want a nice contrast with the extremely busy Old Town of Dubrovnik, the Arboretum is just 20 km away. We spent a couple of hours there walking past the many labeled trees, and also took the road down to the coast. On top of that it was interesting to see that it was the",
          "Make sure you know what you're going to before you set out. It is not a polished, shiny tourist resort. Cost 45kn (\u00a35.50) to get in, kids were free. Villa currently being investigated with a view to refurb. Currently full of photos of what it looked like circa 1900 - 1930.",
          "This arboretum is a lovely, peaceful, place on a hillside with great views over the coast. On one side of the site there is a more formal garden that surrounds the house of the old estate. (There is a public toilet in the house.) The formal garden has an ornate fountain/pond,",
          "We read about this place in a tour book which said 'must visit' and yet we were almost put off going after reading some of the reviews here. We was so pleased we decided to visit and make up our own minds as we thought it was quite charming. If you want well manicured gardens",
          "There seem to be quite a few reviews suggesting this garden needs tidying up and better tending. However we loved it...yes it's a little tired around the edges, but that in a way reflects its age & history. The setting is simply stunning with amazing views out to sea.",
          "This is not a manicured garden as some recent reviewers seem to have expected, it is an old and diverse arboretum on a wonderful hillside site overlooking the sea.. Lots of old and excellent specimens from all over the world. Yes, it is a bit unkempt but on a sunny October day",
          "I wish this place was more well looked-after. The whole place has such potential, yet it felt dead, the opposite of what an arboretum should be like. The variety of plants were poor, and paths were barren. Sad, given that this place has a prime location by the sea, and beautiful",
          "There were parts of this arboretum that were not accessible and others that didn't look very well cared. I think it could improve a lot if it would be properly maintained. Anyway, it was still a very well spent morning.",
          "The place is one of the worst maintained managed gardens on display in Europe or America. If you have time and do not dare to spend around 7 eur - hope our fees allow them to keep it from falling apart finally. If you are short of time - skip it from your program. Take the path",
          "Well reviewed in the Rough Guide I expected more of the arboretum. I guess for those who love their horticulture then this might be worthwhile but it was small, rather tired and expensive at 45 kuna.",
          "My 19 year old dragged us to this place which she lived because of the various Game if thrones sets but they had passed me by. As an arboretum, it's ok, quite small and there are a couple of sheds to look at too. We exited the gardens and went down to the sea which was very nice",
          "Decided to visit after having good reports Went by local bus and about 25 minutes of very scenic views Bus fare 16kn about 2 euro so very reasonable Entry is 45kn and whilst this is only euro 6-7 it is still too much for what it is The grounds are in urgent need of maintenance",
          "Took the local bus to Trsteno and the Botanical Gardens. OK, it's not Kew, but they offer a pleasant couple of hours visit. 40kn each [about \u00a34.40]. Water feature impressive and the views of the coastline. Some areas are very picturesque, other parts of the gardens do lack",
          "I recommend this place. It is quite easy to get there from Dubrovnik and it is worth the detour. There are not many tourists as in Dubrovnik, so if you wish to run away from the crowd in August, go to Trsteno. It takes 30 minutes of visit and you have a lovely view of the sea.",
          "A pleasant garden, with a few scenic areas, but overall, not worth the trip or entrance fare as it is similar to other gardens seen elsewhere. Not a lot of areas to sit and relax. It ended up being an in and out visit in 30 minutes. We visited on the way from Dubrovnik to",
          "The Arboretum was really messy when we visited. Lot's of weeds, and altough they have signs for the trees and plants, it's only their name. There is no extra information. We went to see the GoT scenery, but that was closed. More signs would be an improvement, otherwise not",
          "It may well have been that we were so hot and manky from travelling here that we weren't in the best mood but I was a little let down by this place. It has so much potential and some lovely lovely vistas over the coast and the pond/fountain is lovely but it would have been nice",
          "The teenagers were not impressed with this as an outing but we all loved it when were were there! It is such a beautiful place with many paths and features to explore. The old house is stunning as is the olive press. We recognised locations from Game of Thrones too! Very",
          "Whilst my husband and I like botanical experiences, my son was interested in visiting a Games of Thrones filming site. He also enjoyed the fountain and the aqueduct. We enjoyed looking at the large Plane trees. A nice place to visit.",
          "A tranquil place to visit after Split and Dubrovnic .We spent a couple of hours walking around the numerous pathways which were shaded by enormous trees. The terrace at the end of the main patway in , overlooking the islands and beautiful little bay, at the base of the gardens",
          "We spent the morning here. It was tranquil walking around - listening to the birds and bugs and wandering around the paths. At first, we were a little wary since all we seemed to see were bay trees. But as soon as you get to the bottom on the main walking path, the variety",
          "A beautiful garden set around a villa and tiny chapel. Full of butterflies, little Iizards, dragonflies and grasshoppers as well as huge trees and lovely planting. The crazy Neptunes Grotto and aqueduct are marvellous. The cherry on top is the beautiful view down to a gorgeous",
          "This is a very large arboretum well worth a visit it is also a great place to find cool shade. It is on a hill running down to the sea. There is no restaurant nearby so take water and food.",
          "We loved it here. We took a cab here and it cost around \u00a320. It's fairly far outside the old town but well worth the trip. A few scenes from Game of Thrones were filmed here and if you are familiar with the series you will recognise the setting. We got a bus back to old town",
          "After the craziness of Dubrovnik, Trsteno was a nice getaway. It was pretty easy to get to.. local bus to the Port and then another bus to the gardens. There were majestic plane trees at the top of the road to marvel at. Then a nice walk down to the Arboretum. It was nice and",
          "if you need quiet place to walk one hour, after long drive on way to Dubrovnik/Montenegro, this is the place. old arboretum, with stunning seaside view...",
          "Beautiful garden! take the time for a stop on the way from Dubrovnik to Split! You wouldn\u2019t be disappointed!",
          "You won't find anything as beautiful and peaceful as Trsteno Arboretum. Only 20 minutes away from Dubrovnik (easy to reach by car and by bus), you will find this majestuous garden holding one of the last Greek vestige in Croatia - The fountain of Poseidon. I was completly",
          "For us it was just an ok trip on our drive from Dubrovnik to Split. I suppose after being in Dubrovnik I was expecting to be wow'ed. The place is smaller than you think. We enjoyed more driving along the coastline, stopping for coffee at the different little towns and such.",
          "Probably not so much of an interest to you if you're not a gardener but very peaceful with beautiful views as is everywhere here in Dubrovnik. - We bumped into some people who complained 'nothing to do here' and there are no souvenir shops or cafes it is, as the names implies,",
          "After reading much high praise for the gardens we expected specular gardens and views on a large scale ! Unfortunately this was not the case! Trip advisors reviews built it to something it wasn't ! It's a nice place but not worth the 35 min bus ride out ! It's a nice place if",
          "This is a beautiful place to spend a peaceful afternoon. Very reasonably priced and you can spend as long or as little here as you like. There are lots of varieties of plants to discover and the pathway leads you past gorgeous buildings and fountains to explore. There is some",
          "Walking around this Arboretum you can easily imagine what it must have felt like in the early 1900's. If you enjoy gardening and have \"green fingers\" then this is the must visit place on your holiday. There is a small entrance charge but you could easily spend an hour or more",
          "The gardens are located down a hard to find narrow road in the middle of the town of Trsteno. There is an informal car park set amongst the forest. The gardens are mostly informal with paths meandering through them and there are numerous species of plants from around the world.",
          "My wife and I made a daytrip to the Trsteno arboretum from Dubrovnik. If you're into spending time outdoors, arboretums and beautiful views, this is the place for you. It is nice and quiet here, which is nice considering bustling Dubrovnik is nearby.",
          "This is only 20 minutes out of Dubrovnik but what a tranquil place it is. We went about 9.30 am and there was not a tourist in sight. A lovely rambling place which is beautiful and so relaxing with lots of shade. Well worth a few hours whilst exploring around Dubrovnik area",
          "Just returned to our hotel after an enjoyable visited to the arboretum. Quite cheap to get in. A very rambling rustic sort of a place, not a lot of maintenance happens here but still interesting. We're about to leave and decided to wander down the road beside and came upon a",
          "Try to get as lost as you can in this place and you will be rewarded with bewitching views and a feeling of enchantment. This was done a bit by design - and fooled me. At the turn of the century (i.e.early 18-1900) a sort of pagan/Roman/Greek/'garden' was created. If you",
          "Arboretum is about 20 minutes drive from Dubrovnik. It is a lovely place to relax, walking through the garden, and getting away from the crowd of people in the old-town. Though we were there in May, which is before the high season, so maybe there were very few people visiting",
          "A lot of people think that if you do not have a car or not on an official tour then the Arboretum is out of bounds. It is not true. Buses depart from Dubrovnik, Nos. 12 and 35 and more that will get you there in less than half an hour for 16kn. The Arboretum, one of the oldest",
          "This place was once own by some rich family it was made more than a hundred years ago. Today is famous for Game of Thrones filming and every fan will recognize some of the places just by walking around the place. Besides that there are a variety of plants all around the world.",
          "Located about 20 minutes from Dubrovnik is this gem. A quiet oasis surrounded by fountains and multiple species of tree and plant this place is great to escape the crowds. A few Game Of Thrones scenes were filmed here as well.",
          "This was a stop-off for us on our way by minibus to the island of Korcula and did not disappoint. Our highlight was as we approached the lily pond to be greeted by what sounded like a cross between ducks and monkeys. A veritable cacophony of sound which turned out to be frogs",
          "We visited the Trsteno Arboretum as part of a Game of Thrones tour. This attraction was a lot prettier than other nature areas around Dubrovnik such as Lokrum and the Elephiti Islands. The viaduct leading to a fountain being the best part. Tips Game of Thrones fans, you can go",
          "The place is fantastic but sadly only a small part of it is very well arranged and \"visitable\". When you pay for the ticket they give you a map of the place but you don't need it since the main attractions are right at the entrance. The fountain is on the left and from then on",
          "We spent a morning at the Arboretum, enjoying the mix of garden types. Almost all of the plants are labelled in several languages. There is a wonderful mix of plants to enjoy, and the old aquaduct, fountain, villa and olive press add to the experience. The Arboretum is a",
          "Definitely worth the journey if you're staying in or around Dubrovnik. It's absolutely stunning, particularly the fountain and an area with a view into the bay and harbour below. You can easily walk around it in an hour or two, but I would recommend taking a picnic and spending",
          "The Arboretum is wonderful, with so many plants and an expansive, well laid out grounds. Every tree is labelled in many languages and the aqueduct and fountain are amazing to behold. The buses from Dubrovnik to Trsteno are quite spaced out, but you don't need to spend a long",
          "Beautiful arboretum with good variety of well marked plants. A few massive trees, old photos inside the house and an amazing sea view. Definitely walk down to the \"beach\" and take a swim in crystal clear water - it's worth it though you need also to climb back up... The beach",
          "I would have awarded 5 for the arboretum if I had gone in the summer, but as it was March, it wasn't too hot but it would be so nice to walk round in the heat because it is just so cool walking in amongst all the trees. Trsteno is about 12 miles (20km) from Dubrovnik and it is a",
          "Perfect place for a walk with family, especially in a really sunny and hot day. Also filming location for Game of Throne",
          "This is undoubtedly worth a visit. The gardens are well kept and beautiful. The views of the coastline are fantastic. Even better if you are a fan of GoT. There are several filming locations to be found",
          "Breathtaking. Also, when you leave the enclosed (pay for) part, a lot of the pleasure grounds are open and accessible for free to meander down to the old jetty. Unspolt, romantic and awe-inspiring.",
          "On a showery day we stopped to view the 500 year old plane trees by the road (which are worth a stop themselves), then decided to walk down the hill to visit the Arboretum. What a great decision. The Arboretum was set out around 400 years ago and has a well structured network of",
          "Visited here in October, there is a certain wild and unkempt feel as not very well maintained. Beautiful villa and fountain. Was good to see some of the locations for game of thrones. We travelled by bus from dubrovnik, took about 40 mins to get there and 20 back? Easy and",
          "The gardens were not large but very beautiful. We visited in mosquito season so make sure you have repellent. The flowers, trees, house, fountain were all worth seeing. A great stop if you are driving along the coast to Split.",
          "Came upon this place by accident doesnt seem to be advertised so very quiet. Fabulous place well worth a visit. appears in Game of Thrones apparently. EAsy to get too by public transport",
          "Hint: if you're trying to find the GOT training pavilion, drive past the arboretum, down the hill, park at the bottom, then walk into the structure, past the broken down bar and down the stairs....!!! The arboretum itself is not maintained nor impressive sadly but has all sorts",
          "It is a nice place to visit and spend an hour in the shadow of big trees among the tropical plants. The view from the terrace is fantastic. The park is nice, not too much \"done\", still having a flavor of something old and well preserved. The park was damaged during the war 20",
          "Beautiful gardens at Trsteno Arboretum but if you blink youll miss the tiny village its in, Definatley worth a visit.",
          "Try to imagine what this place must have been like in the early 1900 and it will conjure up a very grand place where no expense was spared in the pursuit of excellence. The aqueduct, carrying the head of water to drive the fountain must have cost more money than the average",
          "The most beautiful place on the Coast of the Adriatic sea. Functional Camp is an allocation of beautiful Aborteum. Nooks surprising places of sunbathing on the rocky coast, charming and secret. It isn't impossible to pass this place on the route to Dubrownik city.",
          "For me there wasn't much to see. Neptune's fountain, which I found a bit spooky or bizarre but cool, was probably the most interesting thing. There's a small port below the arboretum which is photogenic and where you can go for swimming. Entrance is 45 kunas. Buses back to",
          "Another location where the TV Serie Game of Thrones has been filmed. It is not so well kept. A little overgrown and full of weeds. Too bad because it would look much better.",
          "We stopped here for an hour or so on our way to Dubrovnik. The arboretum is fairly wild. The fountain is nice and there's a good view from the pavillion, but it was much smaller than we envisaged, and not worth the entrance fee in our opinion.",
          "We kayaked into the harbour then walked up into the Arboretum from there, with great views out over Lopud all the way up. Unfortunately a lot of it is really run down, but it is still nice to walk around the unmaintained areas. The grotto is well worth looking at, and is kept in",
          "The are two main focal points that have been maintained and that is the grotto and the gardens in front of the main villa. Otherwise there are a lot of areas that are being neglected, such as the greenhouses hidden from view by overgrowth and beautiful giant agaves being",
          "During our stay in Dubrovnik we visited Arboretum Trsteno, which is a lovely spot and has some real gems in form of a grotto with water feature and statues and an aqueduct. Still the overall feel is really neglected. The Arboretum should be renovated and planted up to standards,",
          "Nothing special, poorly maintained, plants are maintained itself.. But they are nice. I expected a lot more, nature is beautiful as well as the centuries-old plants",
          "This is a gorgeous place - and easy to get to from Dubrovnik. Entry was 45 kuna (about \u00a34.50), it took us around 1hour to walk around completely and it was a very serene, with not many other people there. The amount of exotic trees and plants gave some shade from the sun - it",
          "I visited the arboretum on a road trip from Dubrovnik to Plitvice. The place is beautiful with some cool spots, but it is just average. If it is on your way and have enough time, you can stop and visit. If you are in Trsteno, don't miss the old stone pier.",
          "I don't get all of the great reviews. My rating of 3 stars is generous. I wouldn't call the gardens poor but they certainly aren't average. In their hey day, I bet they were great. The old fountain is nice and must have been pretty impressive many, many years ago. Today, the",
          "Unique and beautiful, nice place for a half day trip. One of the GOT locations, super nice, friendly staff.",
          "A nice calm, relatively cheap place to visit. It' nice to be in such a green and refreshing place in hot summer days. GoT filming locations are an added bonus :) And the views are very nice.",
          "My boyfriend and I took our hire car out here one morning for a trip out of Dubrovnik. Entrance was 45kn which was reasonable. The gardens aren't huge so you won't need more than an hour here but it's very romantic wandering around. The fountain is beautiful and we took a stroll",
          "Great value , $9 A admission. 70 acres of lush historical gardens on top of the cliff overlooking the Adriatic sea. Dates to 1494. Visit here and then head down the cliff for a swim at Trsteno beach. We did and it was fun & memorable.",
          "While I expected a larger crowd because this is a location for the Game of Thrones, this garden was actually very tranquil and relaxing. The lack of crowds was very peaceful and let me travel through the arboretum in peace. While the grounds are not that big, the area around",
          "We took a taxi here from Dubrovnik and wandered round the arboretum for a little over an hour. Worth it for the fountain and the cliff top villa, as used in Game of Thrones by Lady Olenna. When you are done in the arboretum take the wee trail down to the Adriatic, there is a",
          "We went because of the link to Game Of Thrones but we were pleasantly surprised and how peaceful the Arboretum is, take some time out from the hustle and bustle and just smell the plants and relax!",
          "We visited during our Eliphiti Islands boat trip. We started to get some rough weather so we decided to stop near the dilapidated Villa Aurora at the base and walked up. It's quite a pleasant walk up and the gardens are a tranquil relief from the noise and bustle of waves and a",
          "A lovely break from the heat and the crowds of Dubrovnik Old City. The plant specimens were collected from all over the world, so there are some interesting plants. Also an interesting place for Game of Thrones fans; you will recognize many spots as filming locations. Make sure",
          "Like said in the tourist guide, the Arboretum is the right place for all dead tired from work and close combustion. As I belong to the categories mentioned I wanted a little peace for my mind and soul. Although the walk lasts up to 45 minutes, you will quickly finds serenity.",
          "Don't get me wrong, the gardens are pretty and tranquil with a nice view of the coastline. If you're a Game of Thrones fan, it's interesting to see another filming location. It takes 30 mins by public bus from Dubrovnik bus station to reach the gardens, but by the time you",

          "It is a lovely peaceful setting. The gardens and trees are not particularly well laid out and there is no guidance as to what each plant is. Would not go out of my way to get there but, if passing, worth a short stop to stretch your legs and enjoy the sunshine. Not very",

          "We visited in early July \u2013 it wasn\u2019t very busy but I imagine when the schools are on holiday it\u2019ll be very busy! Parking is not very good but if you keep driving around you will find somewhere. The gardens are lovely, very tranquil, it is a pleasure to walk around taking",
          "Beatifully located just over the small port with fantastic views, but also secret places between trees and bushes. So many nice spots that give you peace and harmony. If I may say it should be kept better and hope it will be so in the future. I also do not understand why it is",

          "I am not a fan of plants. I went there because of Game of Thrones. I expected to see beautiful garden but the garden was so-so and ran down. They did not maintain the garden well. The pavilion next to the sea is also close without plan to renovate it. It is hard to find",

        "wiki": "The Siege of Dubrovnik (Serbo-Croatian: Opsada Dubrovnika, \u041e\u043f\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430) was a military engagement fought between the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Croatian forces defending the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA started its advance on 1 October 1991, and by late October, it had captured virtually all the land between the Pelje\u0161ac and Prevlaka peninsulas on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, with the exception of Dubrovnik itself. The siege was accompanied by a Yugoslav Navy blockade. The JNA's bombardment of Dubrovnik, including that of the Old Town\u2014a UNESCO World Heritage Site\u2014culminated on 6 December 1991. The bombardment provoked international condemnation, and became a public relations disaster for Serbia and Montenegro, contributing to their diplomatic and economic isolation, as well as the international recognition of Croatia's independence. In May 1992, the JNA retreated to Bosnia and Herzegovina, less than 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) from the coast in some places, and handed over its equipment to the newly formed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). During this time, the Croatian Army (HV) attacked from the west and pushed back the JNA/VRS from the areas east of Dubrovnik, both in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by the end of May linked up with the HV unit defending the city. Fighting between the HV and Yugoslav troops east of Dubrovnik gradually died down.\nThe siege resulted in the deaths of 194 Croatian military personnel, as well as 82\u201388 Croatian civilians. The JNA suffered 165 fatalities. The entire region was recaptured by the HV in Operation Tiger and the Battle of Konavle by the end of 1992. The offensive resulted in the displacement of 15,000 people, mainly from Konavle, who fled to Dubrovnik. Approximately 16,000 refugees were evacuated from Dubrovnik by sea, and the city was resupplied by blockade-evading runabouts and a convoy of civilian vessels. More than 11,000 buildings were damaged and numerous homes, businesses, and public buildings were looted or torched.\nThe operation was part of a plan drawn up by the JNA aimed at securing the Dubrovnik area and then proceeding north-west to link up with the JNA troops in northern Dalmatia via western Herzegovina. The offensive was accompanied by a significant amount of war propaganda. In 2000, Montenegrin president Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 apologized for the siege, eliciting an angry response from his political opponents and from Serbia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted two Yugoslav officers for their involvement in the siege and handed a third over to Serbia for prosecution. The ICTY indictment stated that the offensive was designed to detach the Dubrovnik region from Croatia and integrate it into a Serb-dominated state through an unsuccessful proclamation of the Dubrovnik Republic on 24 November 1991. In addition, Montenegro convicted four former JNA soldiers of prisoner abuse at the Morinj camp. Croatia also charged several former JNA or Yugoslav Navy officers and a former Bosnian Serb leader with war crimes, but no trials have yet resulted from these indictments.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn August 1990, an insurrection took place in Croatia, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and after declaring its intention to integrate with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated and the Croatian War of Independence erupted. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium followed, after which the decision came into effect on 8 October. The RSK then initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croat civilians, expelling most non-Serbs by early 1993. By November 1993, fewer than 400 ethnic Croats remained in the United Nations (UN) protected area known as Sector South, and a further 1,500 \u2013 2,000 remained in Sector North.As the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK, and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. In November, the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (HV). The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate with the Battle of Vukovar, which started on 26 August.Dubrovnik is the southernmost major Croatian city. It is located on the Adriatic Sea coast. The walled city centre, known as the Old Town, is a site of historical monuments and heritage buildings largely dating to the Republic of Ragusa; the city has been placed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 1991, the city had a population of approximately 50,000, of whom 82.4% were Croats and 6.8% were Serbs. Croatian territory surrounding the city stretches from the Pelje\u0161ac peninsula to the west and the Prevlaka peninsula in the east at the entrance to the Bay of Kotor on the border with Montenegro. This territory is very narrow, especially near Dubrovnik itself, and consists of a 0.5 to 15 kilometres (0.31 to 9.32 miles) wide coastal strip of land.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nIn mid-1991, top JNA commanders\u2014including Yugoslav Federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijevi\u0107, JNA Chief of the General Staff General Blagoje Ad\u017ei\u0107 and deputy defence minister Vice Admiral Stane Brovet\u2014planned a military offensive entailing an attack on the Dubrovnik area followed by a westward JNA advance towards western Herzegovina to link up with the JNA 9th Knin Corps in northern Dalmatia once the area was secured. General Jevrem Coki\u0107 submitted the plan of the Dubrovnik offensive to Ad\u017ei\u0107 for his approval.In September 1991, the JNA and the leaders of Montenegro said that Dubrovnik should be attacked and neutralized to ensure Montenegro's territorial integrity, to prevent ethnic clashes and to preserve the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 stated that Croatian borders needed be revised, attributing the existing border line to \"poorly educated Bolshevik cartographers\". The propaganda, compounded by JNA Colonel General Pavle Strugar's allegations that 30,000 Croatian troops and 7,000 terrorists and Kurdish mercenaries were about to attack Montenegro and seize the Bay of Kotor led many in Montenegro to believe that Croatia had actually started an invasion. The newspaper Pobjeda was the most significant media source that contributed to the spread of the propaganda. In July 1991, high-ranking Serbian official Mihalj Kertes said at a political rally in Nik\u0161i\u0107 that a Serbian state was to be established west of Montenegro extending to the Neretva River with Dubrovnik\u2014renamed Nik\u0161i\u0107-at-Sea\u2014as its capital.On 16 September 1991, the JNA mobilized in Montenegro citing the deteriorating situation in Croatia. Despite a radio broadcast appeal by the JNA 2nd Titograd Corps on 17 September, considerable numbers of reservists refused to respond to the call-up. On 18 September, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 threatened harsh punishment of deserters and those refusing to respond to the mobilization. The mobilization and the propaganda were  in contrast with assurances from Yugoslav federal authorities in Belgrade that there would be no attack against Dubrovnik. The JNA's strategic plan to defeat Croatia included an offensive to cut off the southernmost parts of Croatia, including Dubrovnik, from the rest of the country.On 23 September, JNA artillery attacked the village of Vitaljina in the eastern part of Konavle and Brgat to the east of Dubrovnik. Two days later, the Yugoslav Navy blockaded maritime routes to the city. On 26 September, the JNA renamed its Eastern Herzegovina Operational Group the 2nd Operational Group and subordinated it directly to the Federal Ministry of Defence and the JNA General Staff. Coki\u0107 was appointed the first commanding officer of the 2nd Operational Group but was replaced by General Mile Ru\u017einovski on 5 October following the shooting down of Coki\u0107's helicopter. Strugar replaced Ru\u017einovski on 12 October.\n\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\nThe JNA tasked the 2nd Titograd Corps and the 9th Boka Kotorska Military-Maritime Sector (VPS)\u2014both of which were elements of the 2nd Operational Group\u2014with cutting off and capturing the Dubrovnik area. The 2nd Titograd Corps deployed the 1st Nik\u0161i\u0107 Brigade while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS employed the 5th and the 472nd Motorized Brigades. The Corps boundary running north-to-south near Dubrovnik was set. The 2nd Operational Group also commanded the 16th Border Patrol Detachment and 107th Coastal Artillery Group, and mobilised Territorial Defence units from Herceg-Novi, Kotor, Tivat, Budva, Bar, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Trebinje. Strugar was in overall command of the 2nd Operative Group while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS was commanded by Vice Admiral Miodrag Joki\u0107. Joki\u0107 replaced Admiral Krsto \u0110urovi\u0107, who had died in uncertain circumstances hours before the offensive began. Major General Nojko Marinovi\u0107, once commanding the 472nd Motorized Brigade and subordinate of \u0110urovi\u0107, said that the JNA had killed the admiral because he opposed the offensive. Marinovi\u0107 resigned his post on 17 September and joined the Croatian ZNG. The JNA 2nd Operational Group initially deployed 7,000 troops and maintained similar troop levels throughout the offensive.The defences of Dubrovnik were almost non-existent\u2014at the outset of hostilities there were 480 troops in the city area, out of which only 50 had some training. The only regular military unit was a platoon armed with light infantry weapons that was stationed in the Napoleonic era Fort Imperial atop the Sr\u0111 Hill overlooking Dubrovnik. The rest of the troops in the area were poorly armed because the Croatian Territorial Defence had been disarmed by the JNA in 1989. Unlike elsewhere in Croatia, there had been no JNA garrisons or storage depots in Dubrovnik since 1972 and thus very few arms and munitions captured during the September Battle of the Barracks were available to defend Dubrovnik. On 26 September 200 rifles and four artillery pieces captured from the JNA on the island of Kor\u010dula were sent to reinforce the city. The guns were a mix of 76 mm and 85 mm Soviet World War II-era divisional guns. In addition, an improvised armoured vehicle was supplied to the city. Dubrovnik also received additional HV, Croatian Police and Croatian Defence Forces troops from other parts of Croatia. This brought the number of Croatian troops in Dubrovnik to 600. By November, about 1,000 Croatian troops were defending the city. On 19 September, Marinovi\u0107 was appointed commanding officer of the defences in Dubrovnik, at which time he assessed them as inadequate. The troops, initially organized as the Territorial Defence of Dubrovnik, were reorganized into the HV 75th Independent Battalion on 28 December 1991 and were later reinforced with elements of the 116th Infantry Brigade to form the 163rd Infantry Brigade on 13 February 1992. The Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik, a volunteer military unit of the Croatian Navy consisting of 23 vessels of various sizes and 117 volunteers, was established on 23 September to counter the Yugoslav Navy blockade.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== JNA advance ===\n\nOn 1 October, the JNA started its offensive towards Dubrovnik, moving the 2nd Titograd Corps west through the Popovo field north of the city. The JNA 2nd Corps destroyed the village of Ravno before turning south towards Dubrova\u010dko Primorje area, aiming to envelop Dubrovnik from the west. The second axis of the JNA advance was assigned to the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS. It originated in the Bay of Kotor about 35 kilometres (22 miles) south-east of Dubrovnik and was directed through Konavle. The advance started at 5 am after preparatory artillery fire against Vitaljina and other targets in Konavle. The advance, using several roads in the region, was supported by the Yugoslav Navy and the Air Force. Croatian defences were nonexistent in Konavle and light in Dubrova\u010dko Primorje\u2014the only JNA casualties of the day occurred during a successful ZNG ambush in \u010cepiku\u0107e village. On the first day of the offensive, JNA artillery attacked Sr\u0111 Hill and the \u017darkovica promontory just to the north and east of Dubrovnik, while Yugoslav Air Force MiG-21s raided Komolac in Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka to the west, destroying supplies of electricity and water to Dubrovnik. Until the end of December, Dubrovnik relied on fresh water supplied by boats and electricity from a few electric generators.Over the next three days, the JNA made slow progress. Its artillery attacked Sr\u0111 Hill, the Fort Imperial and \u017darkovica on 2 October. The next day, the JNA shelled Dubrovnik's Belvedere Hotel, where a ZNG defence post was located, and the Yugoslav Air Force bombarded the city's Argentina Hotel. On 4 October, the JNA 2nd Corps captured Slano in Dubrova\u010dko Primorje, interdicting the Adriatic Highway there and isolating Dubrovnik from the rest of Croatia. On 5 October, the Plo\u010de district of Dubrovnik was shelled, followed by a Yugoslav Air Force strike on the Fort Imperial the next day.On 15 October, Croatia offered peace talks to Montenegro, but the President of Serbia Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 dismissed the offer. The offer was made to the Montenegrin officials because the offensive was first officially endorsed by the Montenegrin government on 1 October. Three days later, Serbia publicly distanced itself from the move, blaming Croatia for provoking the JNA. On the seventh day of the offensive, the Montenegrin parliament blamed the JNA for the attack. On 16 October\u2014a day after Milo\u0161evi\u0107 declined the Croatian offer\u2014the JNA 9th Boka Kotorska VPS force captured Cavtat. The capture of Cavtat was supported by an amphibious landing operation approximately 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) east of Dubrovnik and an airstrike on Plo\u010de district of Dubrovnik on 18 October. The following day, a ceasefire was agreed but it was violated as soon as it came into effect. On 20 October, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked Dubrovnik and on 22 October, the Yugoslav Navy bombarded hotels housing refugees in the Lapad area of the city.On 23 October, the JNA started a sustained artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, including the Old Town within the city walls, drawing a protest from the United States Department of State the next day. The JNA 9th VPS captured \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka and Brgat on 24 October, while the Yugoslav Navy bombarded Lokrum Island. The next day, the JNA issued an ultimatum to the city, demanding its surrender and the removal of elected officials from Dubrovnik. On 26 October, the JNA captured the \u017darkovica promontory 2.3 kilometres (1.4 miles) south-east from the city centre, and took most of the high ground overlooking Dubrovnik by 27 October. The JNA 2nd Corps south-western drive towards Dubrovnik was slower. It destroyed a large portion of the Trsteno Arboretum. The JNA advance displaced about 15,000 refugees from the areas it captured. About 7,000 people were evacuated from Dubrovnik by sea in October; the rest took refuge in hotels and elsewhere in the city.\n\n\n=== Defence of Dubrovnik ===\n\nThe JNA continued its artillery strikes against Dubrovnik on 30 October and the bombardment continued until 4 November, targeting the western areas of Dubrovnik\u2014Gru\u017e and Lapad\u2014as well as the Babin Kuk and Argentina hotels, which were housing refugees. On 3\u20134 November, JNA troops attacked the Old Town and the Argentina Hotel using small arms and sniper fire from positions held by the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472th Motorized Brigade, which occupied the positions closest to the city centre. The next day, Fort Imperial was bombarded once again. On 7 November, the JNA issued a new ultimatum demanding the surrender of Dubrovnik by noon. The demand was rejected and Joki\u0107 announced that the JNA would only spare the Old Town from destruction. The same day, fighting resumed near Slano.JNA artillery and the Yugoslav Navy resumed the bombardment of Dubrovnik between 9 and 12 November, targeting the Old Town, Gru\u017e, Lapad and Plo\u010de, as well as the Belvedere, Excelsior, Babin Kuk, Tirena, Imperial and Argentina hotels. Wire-guided missiles were used to attack boats in the Old Town harbour, while some larger ships at the port of Gru\u017e\u2014including the ferryboat Adriatic and the American-owned sailing ship Pelagic, were set ablaze and destroyed by gunfire. Fort Imperial was attacked by the JNA on 9, 10 and 13 November. These attacks were followed by a lull which lasted until the end of November when the European Union Monitoring Mission (ECMM) mediated in negotiations between the JNA and Croatian authorities in Dubrovnik. The ECMM was withdrawn in mid-November after its personnel were attacked by the JNA, and the mediation was taken over by French State Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs Bernard Kouchner and UNICEF Mission Chief Stephan Di Mistura. The negotiations produced ceasefire agreements on 19 November and 5 December, but neither yielded any specific results on the ground. Instead, the JNA 2nd Corps units located in Dubrova\u010dko Primorje, north-west of Dubrovnik, closed in on the city, reaching the farthest point of their advance on 24 November, as the city defences were pushed back to Sustjepan\u2013Sr\u0111\u2013Belvedere Hotel line. That day, the JNA tried to establish the Dubrovnik Republic in the area it occupied, but the attempt ultimately failed.\n\nIn November, Dubrovnik began receiving the largest deliveries of humanitarian aid since the beginning of the siege. The first successful attempt to sustain the city was the Libertas convoy\u2014a fleet of civilian vessels, the largest being Jadrolinija's Slavija\u2014which arrived in Dubrovnik on 31 October. The convoy sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoy\u2014which also carried the ECMM observers, at least 1,000 protesters, the President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesi\u0107 and the former Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Greguri\u0107\u2014was initially stopped by the Yugoslav frigate JRM Split between the islands of Bra\u010d and \u0160olta, and the next day by Yugoslav patrol boats off Kor\u010dula before the Armed Boats Squadron linked up with the fleet and escorted it to the Port of Dubrovnik in Gru\u017e. On its return, the 700-capacity Slavija evacuated 2,000 refugees from Dubrovnik, although she had to sail to the Bay of Kotor first for inspection by the Yugoslav Navy.\n\nOn 2\u20133 December, the JNA resumed infantry weapons fire against the Old Town, followed by mortar fire against Fort Imperial on 4 December. The heaviest bombardment of the Old Town started at 5:48 am on 6 December. The Old Town was struck by 48 82-millimetre (3.2 in) missiles, 232 82-millimetre (3.2 in) and 364 120-millimetre (4.7 in) mortar shells, as well as 22 wire-guided missiles. Two impact craters indicated the use of heavier weapons. The bombardment was concentrated on Stradun\u2014the central promenade of the Old Town\u2014and areas north-east of Stradun, while other parts of the Old Town sustained relatively few impacts. The attack subsided at 11:30 am. It killed 13 civilians\u2014the heaviest loss of civilian life during the siege. The Dubrovnik Inter-University Centre library containing 20,000 volumes was also destroyed in the attack and the Libertas Hotel was bombarded by JNA artillery aiming to kill firefighters putting out fires caused by an attack earlier that day. The 6 December attack of the Old Town was met with strong protests from the international media, UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor Zaragoza, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Cyrus Vance and the ECMM on the day of the bombardment. Later that day, the JNA issued a statement of regret and promised an inquiry. On 7 December, representatives of the JNA visited the Old Town to inspect the damage but no further actions were noted.All of the Croatian defences were 3 to 4 kilometres (1.9 to 2.5 miles) away from the Old Town, except for Fort Imperial about 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the north. The fortress was attacked at 5:50 am\u2014minutes after the bombardment of the Old Town began. The attack was executed by the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472nd Motorized Brigade, advancing simultaneously from two directions. The primary attack consisted of a company-sized force, and the secondary of a platoon of infantrymen\u2014both supported by T-55 tanks and artillery. By 8 am, the infantry reached Fort Imperial, forcing the defending force to retreat into the fortification and request help. Marinovi\u0107 ordered HV artillery to fire directly onto the fortress and dispatched a special police unit to reinforce the Fort Imperial garrison. By 2 pm, the JNA called off the attack. That day, Sveti Vlaho\u2014the first vessel commissioned by the Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik and named after the patron saint of the city Saint Blaise\u2014was sunk by a wire-guided missile.\n\n\n=== Croatian counterattack ===\n\nOn 7 December 1991, another ceasefire was agreed and the JNA force besieging Dubrovnik became largely inactive. In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement was signed by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and fighting was paused. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. Serbia continued to support the RSK. The conflict largely passed onto entrenched positions and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. The only exception was the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA attacked westward from Dubrova\u010dko Primorje, pushing back elements of the HV's 114th and 116th Infantry Brigades and reaching the outskirts of Ston by the beginning of 1992.The capabilities of the HV increased dramatically in the first few months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February\u20131 March 1992 referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the HVO.In April 1992, the JNA began offensive operations against the HV and the HVO in areas of western and southern Herzegovina near Kupres and Stolac. The 4th Military District of the JNA, commanded by Strugar, aimed to capture Stolac and most of the eastern bank of the Neretva River south of Mostar. The fighting around Mostar and JNA artillery attacks on the city started on 6 April. The JNA pushed the HV/HVO force from Stolac on 11 April and \u010capljina came under JNA fire. A ceasefire was arranged on 7 May but the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces resumed the attack the next day. The attack succeeded in capturing a large part of Mostar and some territory on the western bank of the Neretva River. On 12 May, the JNA forces based in Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the VRS, and the JNA 2nd Operational Group was renamed as the 4th VRS Herzegovina Corps. Croatia saw the JNA moves as a prelude to attacks on southern Croatia specifically aimed at the Port of Plo\u010de and possibly Split. To counter the threat, the HV appointed General Janko Bobetko to command the Southern Front, encompassing the Herzegovina and Dubrovnik areas. Bobetko reorganized the HVO command structure and assumed command of the HVO in the region and newly deployed HV units, the 1st Guards and the 4th Guards Brigades.\n\nThe VRS and JNA attacked north of Ston on 11 April, pushing back elements of the HV 115th Infantry Brigade and elements of the arriving HV Guards Brigades for only modest territorial gain. The frontline stabilized by 23 April and the HV counterattacked and reclaimed some ground after 27 April. On 17 May, Bobetko ordered a major attack of the two full guards brigades. The 1st Guards Brigade was tasked with advancing to link up with the Ston Company guarding access to the Pelje\u0161ac Peninsula and advance to Slano. The 4th Guards Brigade was ordered to secure the hinterland of the Dubrova\u010dko Primorje by advancing along the rim of the Popovo field. At the same time, the JNA was pressured by the international community to pull back east of Dubrovnik to Konavle.The 1st Guards Brigade, supported by elements of the 115th Infantry Brigade, captured \u010cepiku\u0107e on 21 May and Slano on 22\u201323 May. The Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik landed troops in Slano the previous night, but they were repulsed by the JNA. On the night of 23\u201324 May, the JNA attacked Sustjepan and the northern outskirts of Dubrovnik. On 26 May, the JNA started to pull out of Moko\u0161ica and \u017darkovica. The 163rd Infantry Brigade advanced from Dubrovnik; its 1st Battalion took positions in Brgat and \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, and the 2nd Battalion deployed to Osojnik. On 29 May, the 4th Guards Brigade recaptured Ravno. On 31 May, the 2nd Battalion of the 163rd Brigade pushed the JNA to the Golubov Kamen massif overlooking the Adriatic Highway section tracing around the Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka embayment, but failed to capture the massif. The brigade was relieved by the 145th Infantry Brigade on 15 June. Dubrovnik was targeted by the JNA artillery continuously until 16 June, and then intermittently until 30 June. On 7 June, the 1st Guards and the 4th Guards Brigades ceased their advance in Dubrova\u010dko Primorje in the vicinity of Orahov Do, a village to the north of Slano.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nRegardless of its military outcome, the Siege of Dubrovnik is primarily remembered for the large-scale looting by JNA troops and the artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, especially its Old Town. The reaction of the international media and media coverage of the siege reinforced an opinion, already taking shape since the fall of Vukovar, that the conduct of the JNA and the Serbs was barbaric and intent on dominating Croatia, regardless of the destruction of priceless cultural heritage that occurred in the process. Serbian authorities thought the international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed in Croatian concentration camps during World War II. Besides the protests made by Mayor Zaragoza, Vance and the ECMM, 104 Nobel Prize laureates published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on 14 January 1992 at the incentive of Linus Pauling, urging governments throughout the world to stop the unrestrained destruction by the JNA. During the siege, UNESCO placed Dubrovnik on its list of World Heritage in Danger. Because the siege shaped international opinion of the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift in the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, which came to be viewed as an aggressor-state in the West. On 17 December 1991, the European Economic Community agreed to recognize the independence of Croatia on 15 January 1992.Between October and December 1991, the JNA captured approximately 1,200 square kilometres (460 square miles) of territory around Dubrovnik\u2014all of which the HV recaptured in its May 1992 counterattack as the JNA pulled back east of Dubrovnik, and in subsequent HV offensives\u2014Operation Tiger and the Battle of Konavle between July and October 1992. Between 82 and 88 Croatian civilians were killed in the siege, as were 194 Croatian military personnel. Ninety-four Croatian soldiers were killed between October and December 1991. A total of 417 were killed in all military operations around Dubrovnik by the end of October 1992. The JNA suffered 165 fatalities. Approximately 15,000 refugees from Konavle and other areas around Dubrovnik fled to the city, and about 16,000 refugees were evacuated by sea from Dubrovnik to other parts of Croatia. The JNA set up two prisoner-of-war camps to detain those it had captured, one at Bile\u0107a and the other at Morinj. During and after the offensive, 432 people, mainly civilians from Konavle, were imprisoned\u2014292 in Morinj and 140 in Bile\u0107a\u2014and subjected to physical and psychological abuse. The abuse was perpetrated by JNA personnel and paramilitaries, as well as civilians, and included beatings and mock executions. Many of the detainees were exchanged for prisoners of war held by Croatia on 12 December 1991. The two camps remained in operation until August 1992.\n\n11,425 buildings in the region sustained damage; 886 were totally destroyed and 1,675 sustained damage. The cost of the damage was estimated at 480 million Deutsche Marks. Damage to the Old Town of Dubrovnik was observed by a UNESCO team which stayed in the city from 27 November until 20 December 1991. It was estimated that 55.9 percent of buildings were damaged, that 11.1 percent were heavily damaged and one percent were burned down. Seven burnt Baroque palaces were the greatest losses. Additional damage was caused by the JNA troops looting museums, businesses and private homes. All exhibits held by Vlaho Bukovac Memorial Museum in Cavtat were taken away by the JNA, as were contents of hotels in Kupari. The Franciscan monastery of St. Jerome in Slano was also targeted. The JNA admitted that looting took place, but Joki\u0107 said the property would be distributed to Serbian refugees by a special JNA administration set up on 15 December 1991. It is probable, however, that the looted property ended up in private homes or was sold on the black market. Dubrovnik's \u010cilipi Airport was also targeted and its equipment taken to Podgorica and Tivat Airports.Following attempts to justify the JNA offensive, authorities in Serbia and Montenegro tried to deny damage to the Old Town. Radio Television of Serbia said that smoke rising from the Old Town was the result of automobile tyres set on fire by the population of Dubrovnik, echoing Kadijevi\u0107. Officials and media in Montenegro referred to the offensive as the \"war for peace\", or a blockade\u2014applying the term to land operations and the naval blockade. According to a 2010 survey of public opinion in Serbia, 40 percent of those polled did not know who bombarded Dubrovnik, while 14 percent believed that no shelling occurred. In a June 2000 meeting with Croatian President Mesi\u0107, the  President of Montenegro Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 apologized to Croatia for the attack. The gesture was welcomed in Croatia, but it was condemned by \u0110ukanovi\u0107's political opponents in Montenegro and by authorities in Serbia.In 2007, Montenegrin filmmaker Ko\u010da Pavlovi\u0107 released a documentary entitled Rat za mir (War for peace), covering the role of propaganda in the siege, testimonies of Morinj camp prisoners and interviews with JNA soldiers. In 2011, Radio Television of Montenegro broadcast a documentary series using archive footage titled Rat za Dubrovnik (War for Dubrovnik), although an attempt to destroy records of warmongering television and Pobjeda newspaper reports had been made. In 2012, Aleksandar \u010cr\u010dek and Marin Maru\u0161i\u0107 produced a feature documentary titled Konvoj Libertas (Libertas Convoy), which was about the delivery of humanitarian aid to Dubrovnik through the naval blockade.\n\n\n== War crime charges ==\n\nProsecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up in 1993 and based on UN Security Council Resolution 827, indicted Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Strugar, Joki\u0107, the JNA 9th VPS chief of staff Captain Milan Zec and the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472nd Motorized Brigade Captain 1st Class Vladimir Kova\u010devi\u0107. The charges included allegations that the offensive against Dubrovnik aimed to detach the area from Croatia and annex it to Serbia or Montenegro. Joki\u0107 said that the offensive only aimed to blockade Dubrovnik, but that claim was later refuted by Coki\u0107. Mihailo Crnobrnja, a former Yugoslav ambassador to the European Union, speculated that the siege was intended to force an end to blockades of JNA barracks in Croatia and to claim the Prevlaka Peninsula for Montenegro.The trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was never completed because Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died on 11 March 2006 while in ICTY custody. Strugar was transferred to ICTY custody on 21 October 2001. The trial and appeals process was completed in 2008, with a final verdict of conviction of crimes\u2014including attacks on civilians, devastation not required by military necessity and violation of the laws and customs of war. He was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. Strugar was granted an early release in 2009, seven years and four months after his transfer to the ICTY. Joki\u0107 was turned over to the ICTY on 12 November 2001. He pleaded guilty and was convicted of crimes including murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians and violations of laws of war. In 2004, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. The verdict was confirmed and became final in 2005. Joki\u0107 was transferred to Denmark to serve his sentence and was released on 1 September 2008. The ICTY withdrew charges against Zec on 26 July 2002. Kova\u010devi\u0107 was arrested in 2003 in Serbia and transferred to the ICTY. Following an insanity defence, he was provisionally released on 2 June 2004 and the proceedings were transferred to the judiciary in Serbia in 2007 and he underwent  psychiatric treatment at the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade. As of May 2012, Kova\u010devi\u0107 was considered unfit to stand trial by authorities in Serbia. The charges against him include murder, cruel treatment, devastation not required by military necessity and violations of laws of war.In 2008, authorities in Montenegro charged six former JNA soldiers with prisoner abuse committed in Morinj in 1991 and 1992. Four of the six were convicted of war crimes in July 2013. Ivo Menzalin was given a four-year sentence, \u0160piro Lu\u010di\u0107 and Boro Gligi\u0107 were sentenced to three years while Ivo Gonji\u0107 was sentenced to two. The four appealed the decision, and in April 2014, the Montenegrin Supreme Court rejected their appeal. A number of former prisoners of the Morinj camp sued Montenegro and were paid compensation.In October 2008, Croatia indicted Bo\u017eidar Vu\u010durevi\u0107\u2014the mayor of Trebinje and Bosnian Serb leader in eastern Herzegovina at the time of the offensive\u2014for attacks against the civilian population of Dubrovnik. Joki\u0107 confirmed that he received orders from both Strugar and Vu\u010durevi\u0107. On 4 April 2011, Vu\u010durevi\u0107 was arrested in Serbia and Croatia requested his extradition. He was released on bail on 17 June. In September, the extradition request was approved but Vu\u010durevi\u0107 left Serbia and returned to Trebinje, avoiding extradition. In 2009, Croatian authorities filed charges against ten JNA officers, including Coki\u0107, Ru\u017einovski, Strugar, Joki\u0107, Zec and Kova\u010devi\u0107. They were charged with war crimes committed in the area of Dubrovnik prior to or after 6 December 1991, which were not covered by the ICTY indictments. The charges were made after the ICTY supplied documents collected during its investigation. In 2012, Croatia indicted the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 5th Motorized Brigade and charged him with arson for burning 90 houses, businesses and public buildings in \u010cilipi from 5 to 7 October 1991.The siege of Dubrovnik was also a subject in Croatia\u2019s genocide case against Serbia, before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Croatia claimed 123 civilians from Dubrovnik were killed during the siege. Croatia presented letters from the Croatian police to support these claims, however, in its 2015 judgment the Court noted that all these letters were prepared much later, specifically for the case, were unsigned, and failed to indicate the circumstances under which the 123 were supposedly killed. Citing the Strugar and Joki\u0107 ICTY judgments on Dubrovnik, the ICJ in its own judgment recognized that at least two civilian deaths were caused by the unlawful shelling of Dubrovnik on the 6 December and one further on 5 October 1991. However, these verdicts were incomplete, did not encompass the entire period of the siege save for these two days, and were restricted only to the old town, and not to the city of Dubrovnik as a whole. The judgement stated that the Court \"concludes from the foregoing that it has been established that some killings were perpetrated by the JNA against the Croats of Dubrovnik between October and December 1991, although not on the scale alleged by Croatia\".\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n=== News reports ===\n\n\n=== Other sources ===",

          "Only went because it was a spot included with the \"Dubrovnik Card\". Makes you really appreciate the museums in the United States. Terrible exhibits, a few of them looked like those diaramas you made in grade school. Definitely a scam to charge tourists to go in here. Save",
          "We recommend you avoid this museum as they force you to buy a ''Dubrovnik Card'' which gives access to various sites - but NOT to all sites. Hence, you end up paying too much, especially if your time is limited in Dubrovnik. Hard to understand why they don't sell single entrance",
          "There's no doubt that a lot of work has gone into putting this together. It's just that it lacks a strong curatioral guiding hand that would have seen it come together as a consistent themed collection. Some rooms are over-interps'd. Never thought I'd say that about a",
          "I'm quite easy to please usualy but this really was rubbish. You could have put all of the serious exhibits into half a room. The rest of the three and a half rooms worth of stuff can only be described as utter nonsense - Freddie Mercury stroke fish pictures, CDs hanging from",
          "Fun quirky and a bit weird this is an interesting and bizzare museum. Interesting exhibits though a bit sparse. Note that the fish and the sharks etc on display are real and have been preserved (some more successfully than others). As two adults we spent a fun 45min- 1 hour",
          "After getting confused about whether this particular museum was on the Dubrovnik saver card , which I didn't buy, the lovely man let me in without a ticket. I think I confused him. This made the experience so much more enjoyable. I love the presence of Freddie the mercury fish",
          "Unbelievable they take money from people to see photos and fake turtles. I mean, thats not a museum, its a ripoff. Sorry!",
          "Very small and quite strange. Section with paintings of Freddie Mercury as a fish with music from Queen playing but does not explain connection. Another room of CDs hanging up. Just a bit weird. Some stuffed animals etc. Not worth a special visit.",
          "We popped in as we'd bought the tickets which gives you access to the walls and various museums. I thought some of the aquatic exhibits were really quirky. We only spent about half an hour inside.",
          "Not that into natural history but the exhibits were so beautifully presented, I was drawn in. Would be great for children too. And included in the Dubrovnik visitor card.",
          "A nice little museum with friendly staff. But there are a distinct lack of exhibits. Lots of wall murals and diagrams but hardly any actual exhibits. If you are planning to take a school party here to learn about the life cycle of the local turtles then it is great otherwise",
          "This had some interesting displays,particularly on deep sea fish.However I was mystified at the lack of information on the seismic history of the area.The city has suffered a number of earthquakes and you would think that this would be mentioned,but no.A number of stuffed",
          "We just happened to come across this when exploring dubrovnik. We were quite happy with it. Not the best national history museum I've been too but was quiet and cool and busied us for half an hour out of the crowds in dubrovnik. We did really enjoy reading all about the animals",
          "Very informative visit about the Adriatic sea and turtles. If it wasn't for the 3 day Dubrovnik pass however, would probably not have gone.",
          "Would give 5***** if it had more information on the animals in english. Really creative displays on three floors. Mens toilet missing a toilet seat :( great way to pass an hour!",
          "Pretty poor museum with low level exhibits, probably a lot more suitable if you have children especially young ones. The three floors are very sparse and dont have a lot of information about the nature of Croatia with a heavy focus on marine life. Where i would have expected",
          "I would say that this should be one of the last museums to visit. It's okay to spend sometime in it, specially if you bought the Dubbrovnik Card. If you have kids and need to entertain them for 45min this is a good place to go!",
          "Four floors, small museum. Spent 20minutes there. A lot of pictures and plaster make ups, not enough real exhibits. Looks like its target audience is for children. Was free w the Dubrovnik card",
          "Living just outside of London I'm blessed with some of the best museums in the world so am mindful not to compare museums elsewhere to those in London. However this place was really basic; one floor had a section of taxidermy but no information around the items, another floor",
          "The small Natural science museum is located in a very nice old building that is worth a visit. The modernised staircase connects the different floors that host three to four exhibition rooms each. It was formerly a private collection of a pharmacist and ship owner. It shows",
          "A very pleasant museum spread over three floors (with no lift), with a limited number of old, dated stuffed animal exhibits. At the time of our visit there was a photographic exhibition on which included hugely magnified photographs of insects, this was wonderfully interesting",
          "This little museum has been well designed to show off its exhibits. There are 3 floors to see. I particularly liked the exquisite insect photos,showing close ups of a variety of colourful insects. Price is included in the \"buy 1 get into 8 other museums\" ticket.",
          "We've been here for three days and done all the attractions on the Dubrovnik Card, and this is in the top two. Although it is based on the collection of a private individual, it has been expanded and now has been re-presented in a very up-to-date manner. There are stuffed",
          "We went into this museum as part of a multi-museum ticket purchase - it's a nice small museum with exhibits of mostly marine life and some clever presentation as well as the usual preserved animals & fish. Almost empty on the Saturday morning we went, in early September and",
          "This museum gives people informtion on science in a fun and creative way. There are also lots of fun interactive things for kids to discover everything. The subjets are mostly regional and marine wildlife. You can olsa find nature presented by artists in fotography and",
          "This was a small little museum that we found very fun. There were lots of animals, mostly birds, fish, turtles and insects displayed, but we really got a sense of the fauna here. It is included in the Dubrovnik card, so if you have it, it is worth the visit.",
          "We visited this as we took a package card of visit Dubronik. which included 24 hours bus , the city wall , some 20 + museums and all... but this one was closed even thou it is suppose to be open! disappointed :(",
          "This museum was really interesting. It started with an exhibit about turtles, especially ones native to Croatia. It was a very good turtle exhibit. Most of the museum was marine based, with shells in clear spheres hanging from the ceiling, a room about cephalopods, and another",
          "museum is closed. according to poster it should be reopened since january 2015! it's july and they still promote it in dubrovink card as one of attractions",
          "Closed and the annoying thing is that we were not told this when we bought the Dubrovnik card , that gives visitors discounts at 8 top sites , they should offer a discount",
          "Despite the previous reviews, I really enjoyed wandering around the 3 or 4 floors of this museum and found that the exhibits were displayed innovatively, which is a welcome change from some of the other more staid museums in Dubrovnik (e.g. the Maritime Museum). It was",
          "What would you conclude from the title? At first, it wass a little dissapointment, but later on, it was kind of fun and interesting. Stuffed animals, interesting history details about some scientists, Suez canal...as it is included in the Dubrovnik Card, I'd reccommend you to",
          "My husband loved this museum. it was not so inspiring to me. I was more interested in the history of the Suez Canal than I was by the main contents. It would be good to have English labels for the stuffed animals and birds",
          "Entry comes with the Dubrovnik pass. This museum about some of the natural discoveries made by local scientists and effort to dig the suez canal is not that interesting, but worth a quick stop",
          "Agree with the other reviews, lovely old building but contents of museum weren't that interesting. Some exhibits did have English explanations, others didn't ,but it just wasn't a great experience. Shame. Only went as it was part of the Dubrovnik Card but far better sights",
          "The most interesting part of this museum is the building itself. Very nice architecture which gives a great feel of historical building in Dubrovnik. The collection didn't interest me that much, especially because I can't remember any English explanations. It would b nice to",
          "You can just see few fish photograph and nothing about natural history just little nature :) i dont know about cost because we didnt pay. Dont go just waste of time and energy because lots of steps",
          "Even if it comes free with the dibrovnik card i wouldnt recomment visiting.Its not much of a museum and its waste of time.",
          "We only came here because it's free with our Dubrovnik Card. But it was...well, just terrible! A few paintings of fish done by children. Some fish hanging on the wall. You get the idea. Now admittedly, we didn't see the whole thing as we left in disgust after seeing 3",
          "It certainly doesn't compare to London's NHM but if you're interested in a developing collection of dubrovnik artefacts with child friendly exhibits too then this is the place to spend some time!"

The monumental inscription above the main entrance on the front facade testifies to this. Designed by the architect Petar Andriji\u0107 from Kor\u010dula, construction started in 1520 and the church was completed in 1528.The church has one nave with a Gothic-cross-ribbed vault. The lateral windows are also Gothic with the typical pointed arches. Nevertheless, the main facade with the Renaissance elements on the portal and the three-leaf semicircular top as well as the semicircular apse reveal a recognizable Renaissance style. \n\nIn 1667 Dubrovnik was hit again by a disastrous earthquake which killed some 5,000 citizens and destroyed much of the city.

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987.

        "wiki": "The Old Synagogue in Dubrovnik, Croatia is the oldest Sefardic synagogue still in use today in the world and the second oldest synagogue in Europe. It is said to have been established in 1352, but gained legal status in the city in 1408. Owned by the local Jewish community, the main floor still functions as a place of worship for Holy days and special occasions, but is now mainly a city museum which hosts numerous Jewish ritual items and centuries-old artifacts.\n\n\n== Location ==\nLocated in one of the many tiny streets of the Old Town of Dubrovnik, it is connected to a neighboring building which has long been owned by the Tolentino family, who have been caretakers of the synagogue for centuries. The internal layout is different from other European synagogues and has gone numerous refurbishments throughout the centuries, and has a mixture of designs from different eras. The building has sustained damage several times, with the great earthquake in 1667, World War II, and the Croatian War of Independence in the 1990s. The damage has since been repaired as closely as possible to its original design, and the synagogue reopened in 1997. The small museum contains many artifacts from throughout the Jewish community's history in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th to 19th centuries ===\nAfter the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, many of the expelled went east and some eventually settled into independent city of Dubrovnik, where there was already a small Jewish community. Many Conversos (Marranos)\u2014Jews from Spain and Portugal\u2014came to the city; in May, 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Many Jews became traders and craftsmen, dealing with spices, silks, fabrics, and crafts that were in demand at a seaport city. In 1546, Dubrovnik officials allocated a Jewish settlement within the city, with the main street being called Ulica Zudioska (\"Jewish Street\") in the Dubrovnik Ghetto. The 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake caused much damage to the city, including the synagogue.\nJews were still persecuted in the areas around Dubrovnik under Venetian law and attitudes of the local Catholic Church. When Dubrovnik's economic position and power declined in the mid-18th century, Jews were prohibited from engaging in commerce and confined to the ghetto. When Dalmatia and Dubrovnik were occupied by Napoleon I's forces in 1808, essentially ending Dubrovnik's centuries of independence, Jews attained legal equality for the first time. However, when the Austrian Empire annexed Dalmatia in 1814, legal equality was again withdrawn. Jews were granted legal equality under Croatian law in the mid-late 19th century.\n\n\n=== 20th century and after ===\nDuring World War II, Croatia came under the rule of fascists: Dubrovnik was occupied first by the Italian army, and then by the German army after 8 September 1943. Before the Holocaust, 250 Jews lived in Dubrovnik; many were transferred to the island of Lopud along with other Jews from different parts of Croatia, then in June 1943 they were transferred to the Rab concentration camp with most Jews from Italian-occupied lands. In October 1944 Josip Broz Tito's Partisans entered Dubrovnik, and many Jews were transferred by the partisans to the freed territories; the rest were sent by the Germans to concentration camps. After the war, many of the surviving Dubrovnik Jews settled in Israel. Today, approximately 30 Jews live in Dubrovnik, however, only 17 officially registered in the 2001 census. During the Croatian War of Independence, the city was besieged by the Serbian and Montenegrin paramilitary forces in what has been called the Siege of Dubrovnik. Approximately two thirds of the old city was in some way damaged, including the synagogue, where shells and grenades hit the adjacent buildings in 1991, shattering the windows of the sanctuary and Jewish Community Headquarters. In 1992, an artillery shell hit through the roof of the synagogue, causing the congregation to pack up over 80 items to send to the Yeshiva University museum, which included a 13th-century Torah and silver ornaments and textiles. After the war ended, a legal battle ensued between a Manhattan doctor Michael Papo, former president of Dubrovnik community and a direct descendant of Tolentino family, and at the time leader of the Dubrovnik Jewish community late Dr. Bruno Horowitz and the state of Croatia over the synagogue's treasures; eventually, a court ruled in 1998 that the treasures be returned to Dubrovnik.Today, because of the small number of Jews in Dubrovnik, the synagogue does not have its own rabbi. On holy days, a visiting rabbi would conduct services for the small community. In 2003, Israeli president Moshe Katsav visited the Dubrovnik synagogue on a visit to Croatia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBeth Hatefutsoth: Jewish Community of Dubrovnik",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987. Often regarded as a 'Supergroup' due to the band members having played in various established bands such as Hoodoo Gurus, Beasts of Bourbon, and The Scientists. The band chose their name due to two members of the band Roddy Radalj (guitar vocals) and Boris Sujdovik (bass) being born in Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDalmatia\nDubrovnik chess set\nList of people from Dubrovnik\nRepublic of Ragusa\nTourism in Croatia\nWalls of Dubrovnik\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Ragusa\", Bradshaw's Hand-Book to the Turkish Empire, 1: Turkey in Europe, London: W.J.

          "A colleague and I brought a high school aged group of students to the museum and we had a wonderful experience. I have been to a few communist era museums in krakow and Prague and they have similar exhibits, what sets the Red History Museum apart if that you can actually",
          "This is an outstanding museum. It takes you on a fascinating journey from the rise of Tito, through ordinary life in Yugosalvia and the dangers of the regime and back. It is very well structured with well written dual language information boards and ordinary objects to play and",
          "Down the bus station, straight is this. Interactive museum, you can open the wardrobe and sit in the red yugo communist Car, do not miss. You can type on the old type writer, your children would benefit from the communist's education. Better than Florian T Rulitz, on The Tragedy",
          "Not far from the main bus station is this must see museum.Historical and cultural information of croatia/dubrovnick. The former yugoslavia and a deeper understanding. It really provokes thoughts. Well laid out etc etc",
          "Dubrovnik was a stop on our MSC Cruise but we chose not to do an organised excursion and just went for a wander. We are so glad we did as this museum was fascinating. About 10 minutes walk from the cruise port, just off the Main Street, we only spotted it because of the sign",
          "Great collection and story brought to life just wandering or even better with the App. So nice to be able touch things, sit in car, use typewriter etc. Really recommend this",
          "Well done displays. One walks away with a clear understanding of life under Communism, how the area got into it, how they got out of it, and the price they paid. The Red Museum put a human face to the people living behind the \"iron curtain.\" All, who see this ought to ask",
          "The best recollection of Communist Yugoslavia I have read or seen. Excellent museum with easy to read translations and understanding of a time we only read about in history books or remember through the news. Excellent attention to detail and very interactive. It\u2019s a top ten",
          "Unbiased recap in 1-2 hours from a safe enough historical distance. Take time to read all the text, it's worth it. Having lived through last 20 years of it, the exhibition does a good job.",
          "This museum is down at the harbour in Gruz. You can get there by local bus from Dubrovnik or walk as I did it takes about 30 minutes and is easy to find. Very well organised and excellent descriptions in English. I particularly liked the rooms laid out as they were in Soviet",
          "For quite a small space the museum is packed with information and things to see and explore. The history of how communism was established in the country was interesting for me and then the details of how people lived day-to-day and any associated struggles or unusual aspects for",
          "If you want to escape the circus of Dubrovnik and learn about this part of the world before the trauma of the 1990s, this is a really good, even-handed museum about life in Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia. It has a nice mix of history along with period rooms and various objets. A lot of love",

          "This is a small museum that showcases what life was like during Communism. There are many artifacts from the 40's onwards really that brought back so many memories of what I remember as a child. At the start of the tour they explain what communism is and how it all came about",
          "An interesting Museum located very close to where the major cruise ships dock. A real \"blast from the past\". Realise how dated and poorly made some of their items were in the communist era. Not really that much to see for your entry fee. Convenient if you are killing time",

          "Great place to learn some local history. Doesn't really side with or against the communists, purely about what life was like in communist Yugoslavia. We spent about 30 mins there and for 50 Kuna that's not bad to kill a bit of time.",
          "This was a very informative history of everyday life in the former Yugoslavia. Lots of hands-on interactive displays, and it was very well organized. Especially interesting were the first hand reflections and memories of the different age groups of the people who experienced",

          "This was soooo good! One of the coolest things we did in Dubrovnik. It gave an insight into how life was during the communist era but more than that. It gave a often times humourous throw back to that era! It was like walking through communist Ikea. But obviously better than",
          "This is apparently newly opened. A very novel concept mixing augmented reality ( some of the videos are hilarious), interactive audio and you can also do a bit of roleplay by using the sets, clothes etc. The history of Tito is really well documented as a series of storyline,",
          "Needed to kill a couple of hours before my bus so wandered in not knowing what to expect and was really impressed. I spent the equivalent entrance fee in Vienna for a quarter of the information displayed in this museum, and the interactive nature made it engaging and different.",

          "I visited the Red History Museum with my girlfriend during the summer and it was a highlight of our trip. It was a refreshing look at how communism shaped Yugoslavia and how it created an identity for the country in the 20th century. We had our eyes opened to just how unique the",
          "A really interesting and interactive museum which my 12 and 14 year old really loved, esp. as it it was a break from Churches and old buildings well worth a visit if you feel like some different",
          "Having read previous reviews, we were not disappointed. This is a fascinating museum. There\u2019s loads of information and you are actively encouraged to rummage through the cupboards to find out more. The quality and variety of exhibits was great. We particularly enjoyed listening",

          "It was great to leave behind the hurly burly of the Old Town, where most of the museums focus on the Old Town, or history of Croatia. This display was excellent. Expect to take about an hour and a half, and do not skip on the last section where books are laid out for you to",
          "Loved it. It felt like I was in a real house of that time. I wished it was bigger, I didn't want the tour to end",

          "While being a small museum, it seems a lot of effort was put into engaging each visitor into not only learning about the history of communist Yugoslavia, but also the lifestyle of it's people. As far as I know this is(unfortunately) the only museum of its kind in Croatia, and",
          "I work in turism so I wanned to go and experience this museum in order to recommend it to my guests. I loved it! I was born in 1995 so it was a perfect place to see how my parents were growing up and how it all worked out before me :) Thank you guys, I had a great time and",

          "Visited here one afternoon on a very hot day, was too hot inside as no aircon, we kind of rushed around because of this. But it\u2019s a good little museum with an insight of the communism of the country. 50 kuna per person to get in",
          "I saw this museum in the magazine on Easy Jet, and I was intrigued. Then, I arrived in Dubrovnik and was excited to see that it was right next to my hostel and the bus station, and only a few store fronts from Dubrovnik Brewing Company. I knew I had to go. The museum is full of",
          "I recommend this museum to anyone interested in history. You start with a bit of reading that puts you into the context of the museum. If you are not an expert, read it carefully, you will learn a lot. Then, you can find a reconstitution of a typical house from that time (Rich",

          "Orlando attracts lots of walking tours and it's easy to understand why! His symbol as the protector of Dubrovnik means he is a very significant and important statue for the local population. Also interesting to note how his arm was used as a figure of measurement. This is not",
          "Due to the volume of people on the Stradun you can miss him if not careful lots of stories about him and he is meant to be the protector of the city as well as that in days gone by his arm length was used as a measurement! He has been there o think since the 14th century",
          "As previous reviewers have noted, Orlando's column is not just any old statue in any old square in another old town. Its symbolic and meaningful and has interested locals and visitors for centuries. So if you visit and take a photo in front of it, be sure to take the trouble",

          "The perfect place to get a drink at the sunset. I\u2019ve been there with a friend in a evening after we had a walk in the old town of Dubrovnik. The city is really crowdy in the summer but this was a quiet place with good music.",
          "Heard about this \"hole in the wall\" cliffside bar. It was amazing! The views of Lokrum island, all the kayakers below and crystal clear water. After getting directions it was easy to find. Not from from the large Cathedral, follow the wall until you see a sign that reads \" Cold",
          "Whether it is the sunset, the people rock diving, the boats, the birds doing the evening dance in the sky, Buza is worth the visit. Sells beer, wine and urm beer and wine... with soft drinks too. Chilled and a great to watch the world...",
          "Easy to locate both Buza bars / cafes, even if they are not indicated rom outside, it's totally worth to go look for them = amazing view over the harbor and Lokrum island. All cocktails costs 98 Kn, but for the atmosphere is totally worth it.",
          "This bar is tucked away under the city walls hanging on the edge of the cliffs. You could walk down from it and swim (at your own risk). The service in the bar was slow, a bit surly but that is normal here. Very expensive of course, and the beer needed to be colder. The other",
          "They don\u2019t take credit cards (they will take euro!) and they don\u2019t have a food menu (only Pringle\u2019s and peanuts) but if you can find the literal hole in the wall you will be treated to amazing views off of the busy streets and walls of Dubrovnik. The umbrellas provide nice shade",
          "Fantastic little spot for an afternoon break from the tourists with a quiet drink in the sun. Drinks are not cheap but well worth it for the view!",
          "Horrible service. The employees made fun of the clients. Bad service, bad products, the beer was warm and there is no toilet. Not recommended at all.",
          "It is precisely what was expected. A bar where you could plunge into the clear sea at the bottom of the rocks. The actual bar is of the \u201cshack\u201d variety, but the drinks are good. The views, the swimming are fantastic.",
          "We had read numerous mentions of this bar, so when we were in the Old Town of course we had to stop by this little lounge overlooking the Adriatic and enjoy the southerly views of Lokrum and passing the boats. Yes, the drinks are \"tourist-priced\" but you do often pay for the",
          "There are lots of places in Dubrovnik from where you can get the same views. It is overhyped very congested lots of steps crowded. Can be missed.",
          "Drinks with a view - stopped off here briefly for coffees & juices for the kids. Certainly not cheap but an amazing setting for a bar. We stumbled across it and were blown away by the views!",
          "We'd seen Cafe Buza in a lot of articles and Instagram posts, and just had to check out what the hype was all about. One reaches Cafe Buza by literally entering a hole in the wall that opens up to a side of a cliff, with tables on different levels overseeing the water. The bar",
          "This is a must for visitors to the Old Town... Not really condusive, nor that safe for small children. The bar literally is on a cliff face. Things to remember: There is no toilet, so have your bladders emptied beforehand, bladder infections??? Stay away. Cash only, really bad",
          "Enjoyed having a beverage outside the walls overlooking the sea. Great little spot to get away from the city crowds. They don't take credit so remember to bring plenty of Kunas or you will be doing the walk of shame back to the ATMs on the Stradun...",
          "The only asset in this bar is the magnificent view. Beside that, they serve expensive drinks in plastic cups, no ecofriendlyness in this place that profits of natural beauty. Some advise: check the bill and don't drink to much, so you don't need to go to the toilet.",
          "Really refreshing atmosphere and sighteeing. Choice of drink somewhat reduced. Opportunity for dip in sea for more adventurous.",
          "Our family first spot at this when we were up at the very top of the walls in Dubrovnik. We noticed people jumping off the rocks into the beautiful crystal clear ocean and since it was a very hot day it looked incredibly enticing. We finally found it by going through some back",
          "We preferred this bar over the other Buza bar. It wasn\u2019t as cramped and we were able to get a table quickly. We enjoyed the sunset and had a nice aperol spritz. Honestly it was cheaper than a lot of places in old town which is shocking since it is on the side of hill!",
          "Worth every step to find this place. The views are stunning, especially at sunset. Difficult getting a seat but worth being patient. Must get their 'playlist', could have stayed for hours taking it all in.",
          "We went last night and the bar was closed. A man said he worked there but that it was public so we could just enjoy the sunset. He was extremely inappropriate in his comments made to customers with sexual comments and anti-lesbian statements. People were enjoying cliff jumping",
          "Stopped in this bar as we were walking around the old town for the advertised 'cold drinks' on a very hot day. The steps were treacherous and I actually slipped down the last few, and there were no seats available in the shade. The staff were not helpful or friendly with very",
          "a good selection of coffee and snacks. Amazing view to sea and hills around. Service is always fast and very polite staff.",
          "This is accessed through a little hole in the wall (literally) and it is a small bar nestled against the side of the cliff. We went around 7pm and did not get any drinks, just went down into the water. Lots of young kids jumping off the cliff into the water. Nice spot to just",
          "The locals cliffside bar complete with views and cliff jumping. Just one word of warning, don\u2019t drink too much - the toilets are a disgrace.",
          "Cafe Buza had a really nice view and a very casual atmosphere. Just a great place to have a drink and admire the Adriatic. If our hotel did not have a great view, probably would have gone back every night!",
          "This is a beautiful and interesting setting for a bar, through a little hole in the wall (which people were constantly blocking by just peering through as the bar isn't very well signposted). The drinks weren't as pricey as we were expecting but still a little steep. Service",
          "We stumbled upon this 'hole in the wall' on our first afternoon in Dubrovnik and stayed for a couple of hours. Completely chilled vibe, we literally had to drag ourselves away. But we returned everyday mid to late afternoon, after a days sightseeing, with our swimming gear. As",
          "The bar itself is a little crowded and tight, but it\u2019s hard to compete with the beautiful setting on the cliff face. The service was lacking a bit, but we have a good all round experience.",
          "Having read reviews we were looking forward to visiting here..... He idea of it out on the rocks, was appealing so off we went.....it was packed when we got there.....only seats were behind a line of people looking outwards.......we ordered a beer only to be told they only had a",
          "Fabulous views, a nice cold beer and some times a queue to get a seat but worth the wait. You may need to hunt to find the entrance in the walls!!",
          "Very interesting place to visit - other than the spectacular view (especially sunset) nothing much other than the curiosity value. Drinks are expensive and it is very full - you will have to probably wait at least 30 min for a table and it is very much first come first serve.",
          "The view! The breeze! What a fantastic place to have a drink and a chance to sit down away from the crowd. The only thing I didn't like about this bar is that it is so so so far away from my house.",
          "This should be on everyone's list of things to do in Dubrovnik. Great little bar with amazing views. Top tip take your swimwear. Gutted we didn't and the sea looked so inviting.",
          "This is a very unexpected treat when visiting the city on a hot day. Fantastic views and great to cool off with a jump off the rocks!",
          "Fantastic little bar, tucked into the cliffs by the sea. Great place to relax and watch all the sea activities go by. Very casual approach from staff and only bottled drinks available but just chill out and go with it as it works well. We visited 3 times and was always busy but",
          "We came across a cheeky sign 'Cold drinks with the most beautiful view', then greeted a cat eating its meal before we went through a 'hole' in the wall. The Buza bar serves mainly beer and wine. No pornstar martini! The view was spectacular of the Adriatic sea with many kayaks,",
          "Others have said that the drinks were over priced but considering the location I don't think they were too bad! We sat here for a good while with a nice cold drink taking in the view. This should be on your must do list while visiting Dubrovnik.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours out of the hustle and bustle of the city and the sun. Cliff side bar, local currency only no cards. Basic drinks menu. Swimming place and rock jumping so very popular. Great views of the island. Turn over is quick so you don't wait long for a",
          "I think others have pointed out the price, so I won\u2019t mention again. Well worth half an hour and a drink to enjoy the view although you need to be mobile to get there. Would also point out the toilet which is a portable chemical toilet and I would have thought they could do",
          "Spectacular views but way overpriced drinks. Regardless, you still need to experience it. Folks say it\u2019s hard to find but if you do the wall walk thing just keep an eye out for it while you\u2019re walking along the wall by the sea. It\u2019s pretty easy to locate (look for the",
          "We didn\u2019t go to this one in particular, we went to the smaller section (I think they call it Buza bar 2) and it was so nice! It\u2019s hard to find as if it\u2019s in a secret spot but ask around & you will get there! Not crowded when we went, had some drinks from the bar & jumped off the",
          "Really cool place to enjoy a drink and a million dollar view. Perched on a rocky outcropping of seawall, you get there literally thru a hole in the wall! Serve yourself at the bar, find a chair, and relax with a cold Karlovacko or drink of your choice. Then move on. Lots to",
          "Apart from the lovely cat with whom I made friends, this was an excellent place for a mid-morning drink and a read of my book. It was no crowded being 11 am ish and the lemon beer was refreshing too. Toilet is chemical and makes a portalo look luxurious. No 1s only, please!",
          "Had been recommended by several people to go for drinks here, and I would highly recommend everyone visits here at least once as the views are amazing. But a warning as it\u2019s extremely busy with large tourist groups so tables are limited and everyone is jumping around to get the",
          "Service was so-so, quite expensive and food was not great quality, shame heard so much about this place, a bit of a disappointment",
          "Lovely little bar on the side of the cliff overlooking the ocean. Not much choice of alcoholic drinks but this place is all about the view than the drinks! Perfect for a sunny, hot day and the prices aren't too dissimilar to anywhere else in the main areas. It does get very busy",
          "Sun is out ! Watch out Buza, cliffs behind the wall facing the Adriatic! Incredible. People get her there bc the views are endless. Able to jump in the water and soak up the sun with a cool vibe!",
          "The view around sunset is so worth seeking this place out for. Had a wine & peanuts. Not cheap bit its all about the view",
          "Worth a stop when in Old Town...particularly if the weather is nice...even better in the off season. Was pretty packed in May-must be insane June-August. Drinks are meh and twice as much as anywhere else. But you are paying for the view.",
          "I absolutely love this place! Excellent location and service. You can't beat the view. Reccomend to everyone that visits Dubrovnik!",
          "Sat here now and it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s busy but there\u2019s a very chilled vibe. Drinks are a little limited - there\u2019s no cocktails but the red berry cider is great and the beer seems to be going down well too! Staff are attentive and friendly. Music is chilled and the atmosphere is",
          "I\u2019d heard big things about the Buza bars, particularly the \u201cnicer\u201d Cafe Buza so my wife and I visited just before sunset for a few drinks. Unlike some of the reviews I\u2019d read, the staff are fairly attentive - you just need to catch their attention as they walk by. The view was",
          "We went during the time where the cafe wasn\u2019t busy and had plenty of available tables. At first my sister (age 7) selected a seat near the corner and she moved a chair to make room for our father to seat on. The male staff shouted to her in Croatian which I guess it meant he",
          "You've seen the reviews and think, \"ha, I've seen nice views before\"... but this place definitely hits the spot. Clinging to the cliffs below the old city walls, it is a place for (only) cold drinks, good conversation and a VIEW ! We were there doing the day... I suspect in",
          "You go here for the view, nothing else... order a beer or wine (served on plastic glasses) and enjoy the view... nothing else.... Watch out! ONLY CASH!",
          "Lively little bar. Great look out over the sea, with a chilled vibe. Sit, relax, watch the boats go by... and have a drink or two. Staff were fun and informal, adding to the atmosphere of the place. The background music was reggae covers of popular songs; weird but strangely",
          "The main attraction of this bar is the location; the bar has views over the water, so you can watch the sunset and the cliff divers. In this regard, it is spectacular. Everything else is fairly standard. Ordinary beer, standard southern European service, and Dubrovnik prices.",
          "Great views of the coast and the walls, especially at sunset. But the service is poor and the drinks are expensive. Visit for the novelty, but don't stay for more than one drink.",
          "Beautiful view of the ocean and island. Drinks are slightly more expensive than most places however the view is amazing and it\u2019s much quieter than most other places as they are the only bar on the side of the cliff.",
          "Having had recommendations of this bar from others, we actually randomly stumbled across it while walking around the Old Town. As we entered, the view was simply breathtaking. Luckily the weather was on our side (despite clouds and rain during the stay) and we managed to grab",
          "Yes, the view is lovely and we sat in the sun watching the sunset for a while. But, the waiters were not attentive or particularly friendly. All they have is beer, peanuts and a few other drinks and they are much more expensive than other bars that we enjoyed more. But yes,",
          "Cafe Buza promises cold drinks and a view and they deliver. It\u2019s nothing fancy unless, like me, you consider an unmatched view of the Adriatic fancy. They serve exclusively bottled beverages - no mixed drinks. Beer, soda, cider, wine, water. That\u2019s about the extent. The only",
          "A bit hard to find but get to the hole in the wall and walk through a magical door to an amazing view and order a beer. Well worth trying to find. Tip do the wall walk and you can see the Buza Bar and figure out where it is !!!! Enjoy",
          "Amazing view Limited menu but very well priced The facilities are out of order and no Wi-Fi but the stop is still Recomended",
          "We stumbled across this cliffside bar and found it difficult to grab a seat due to the popularity. Once you grab a spot, the choice of drinks is limited, the service is minimal, there is no ice or toilets. It's more of a place to chill and watch the world go by and that's what",
          "Drink beer, see sunset and enjoy the evening. Not a place for late night. Early morning(sunrise) and Late evening (sunset) is the only time when you should go there. Every thing is good about this place except the service. don't expect a restaurant type service there.",
          "The setting and view didn't disappoint the information we had reviewed prior to the visit. Well worth the effort to find and reach the Caf\u00e9 Buza. Although some recent storm damage had impacted the facility the staff was very accommodating. A great location to relax and enjoy",
          "A fun, cozy \"hole in the wall\" bar with rather steep stairs to access. Limited choices for drinks, especially wines. In the end it's all about the atmosphere.",
          "Nothing fancy - just easy drinks sitting outside with a great view. Great after walking the city walls.",
          "Felt I had to review this just out of general irritation at this bar and it\u2019s lazy owners. It should be in the top 5 bars in the world. The setting is simply stunning. However. There is rubbish lying around. Old chairs and broken parasols just thrown on the rocks. The drinks",
          "Sitting right on the rock cliffs, next to the wall on one side and the open ocean on the other. Your trapped so you better relax and have a few beer. Love this spot.",
          "In general Dubrovnik is not cheap, and buza bar is roughly the same price as elsewhere. The view really is stunning and worth the money to soak in the great vibe as well. The bar is quite hard to find so I would advise track it down early and get there a few hours before",
          "We were recommended this place by a guy who proposed to his girlfriend and it is a great spot out on the cliffs outside the walls. It\u2019s a bit tricky to find - it\u2019s only marked by a sign \u2018Cold drinks\u2019 - it\u2019s a bit of a climb down but the sunset is worth it - drinks a good value",
          "Was absolutely horrified when having to use the outhouse at this bar! Actually couldn\u2019t.... it was overflowing! You can find these views elsewhere and be served",
          "Could have sat here all afternoon.....staff were friendly and the view is sublime....half the fun is finding it!",
          "Having read reviews we stopped off here after walking the walls so get a cold drink. It was lovely. We got a seat and spent a really pleasant hour looking at the views. It was really chilled. I imagine it would be great at sunset as well.",
          "Not sure how anyone can give this bar a bad rating-it is what it is. You come here for a drink on the edge of wall in Dubrovnik. We should all be so lucky to have made our way to this spot for a drink overlooking the Adiatic Sea in a country that has endured so much. Chill",
          "This place is pure beauty! Amazing views, relaxing atmosphere, staff relatively friendly. You can jump off the cliff edge and swim in the beautiful clear waters of the Adriatic Sea. Downside were drink prices. It was 42 kunas for a local beer which equates to around \u00a36 GBP!",
          "It was a great time and stunning view! Don\u2019t come here if you are not able to walk a lot! :) It is worth to climb all those stairs!!!",
          "Another must see site for the view, but at a high price. They only serve beverages at a high cost. We followed the signs that said \u201ccold beverages this way\u201d, and we entered a whole in the wall and walked out to a cute cliff bar. We were able to sit and watch the cliff jumpers,",
          "Great stop on a tall climb and walk on the Dubronick city wall. Order one of their juices, relax and take some photos.",
          "A cool, relaxing place to hang out and watch the ships sail by, Cafe Buza is perched on the city walls directly on the ocean. We stayed for a couple of hours, found the staff to be attentive and the other customers really friendly and chatty. A lovely place to come and relax",
          "We went just before sunset and the place was already packed with people from many different countries. It being just along the outer wall along the coast makes for a perfect spot to hang, meet new friends and watch the sunset over the Adriatic. You can even go for a swim or dive",
          "Went to both Buza bars while in the city, we found one better than the other. One only serviced wine and beer while the other offered a full bar. The full bar service was great and friendly staff, and music and atmosphere good. You can swim here too, a great spot",
          "This place can be found in the upper parts of Dubrovnik - there is a cold drinks sign, you go through the wall and down some steps and voila! A little bar with an amazing view. Yes, they're out of a bunch of stuff, and the bathroom is for the brave only, but it's the view",
          "If you like warm beer, warm wine, and don't-care attitude from staff then this is the place to go. One round of 2 very warm beers, 1 glass of warm wine, 1 soft drink and no ice was 165 Kuna. Find somewhere else with a view. Not recommended.",
          "Look for the hole in the city walls, down the rickety steps to the bar, take a seat and watch the boats go by. Drinks are a little pricey and limited and the music is EuroPop!",
          "Quaint drinking spot... exit the old town of Dubrovnik via a hole in the wall to find yourself perched on the cliff side. Enjoy a drink and watch the more adventurist jump off the rocks into the sea. Lovely for sunset cocktails...",
          "We had SO been looking forward to visiting Cafe Buza after reading about it online. It is a bit tricky to find, as you will read. You'll enter through a hole in the city wall. Follow the sign that says, \"Cold Drinks with the Most Beautiful View.\" The view WAS beautiful. But",
          "Spent most of our time in Markaska but I've been wanting to jump off of the cliff at Cafe Buza since I saw others do it 10 years ago so we made a point to spend two days in Dubrovnik at the end of our trip. Best place to sip a beer and watch others jump or be brave and do it",
          "Great place to relax, have a coffee or a juice and take some time to enjoy the amazing view. Prices were a lttle high but is seems quite reasonable as the spot is really unique and the view is jaw-dropping",
          "You will be hard pressed to find a better sun set view in Dubrovnik with a drink. Find the hole in the wall & enjoy :)",
          "Similar to its neighbour bard, buzz serves quite expensive drinks but well worth it to take in the amazing views and watch daredevils jump off the cliffs. It is an amazing spot to take in the sunset and unwind.",
          "Good place to see, once. Take your swimsuit if you wish to jump off cliff. You can jump anytime. The bar itself is quite small with several leveks and lil airflow so quite warm. Drinks are expensive and not super cold. People linger and watch and then move on, it seemed.",
          "Worth a visit for a drink and the views when in Dubrovnik. It's cash only, 84 KRK for 2 bottles of beer.",
          "Perfect spot in the center of Dubrovnik, chill music and not a large choice of drinks but just good for the place ! Great place as well for Cliff jumping in front of the Adriatic. I\u2019ve done it and it felt so good! I recommend",
          "We went early, about two hours before sunset to get a place to sit. It was already crowded and they had reserved signs on a few tables that they insisted were held for reservations. They were very rude and short with us. We finally found a table on a corner. We ordered two soft",
          "View = Amazing! Staff = gloomy and rude Drinks = iced coffee 20kn and served in a tiny plastic cup, beer 42kn for a 0.33l bottle of local beer which is what we were paying for .50l in the old town. Wouldn't recommend apart from to take a few photos",
          "Very bad altitude from the time we entered the bar, we left after 5 minutes, we didn\u2019t order at all , and they were saying the \u201cmen\u201d staff something in croatian., all this because we asked 12 o clock if the bar is open, and they were laughing that we asked, Dont leave money to",
          "If you are in the Old City and not with kids, GO HERE for a drink! Such a fun place! Great music, friendly/helpful staff, cold drinks, and an unparalleled view! The entrance is through a small cave and you\u2019ll need to navigate some steep stairs (so it would be hard with a",
          "My group randomly found this place when walking around Dubrovnik. We heard music peaked out head through a small portal in the city wall and poof! Cliff divers, drinks and awesome views. We had two drinks but we\u2019re mostly there for the views it was excellent. A must see, but if",
          "Lovley views yes, but overpriced for the drinks even for Dubrovnik. We paid 42 kuna for a 330ml bottle of Ozujsko beer which was warm. I asked for cold ones as replacement and got 2 warm Becks. You will see cliff divers and it is a lovely view so worth a visit, but order",
          "Buza bar is not a secret any more, which means it can be overcrowded and not have the best service, but it still remains a great spot to have a drink and soak up one of the best views in the city. If it's busy when you get there just come back at another time.",
          "We found this place by chance but it was a big bad surprise. No cocktails, no ice and they even served hot beers. Rude waiters almost made a joke of us when complaining. If you see this place, you better don\u2019t get in.",
          "Great location,expensive due to fantastic views of the sea.3 stars are for the view alone.drinks were pricey and seating area felt crowded.would recommend going for one drink.heard people complaining about state of toilets but didn\u2019t use ourselves.",
          "Its been said, but worth repeating. Buza is on the edge of the walls, on the rocks looking out over the Adriatic. There's steps down, its narrow, no running water and plastic cups. Don't expect a high end bar. But its brilliant!! What a place to chill and have a local beer!!",
          "View might make up for it but this is otherwise a dingy place with plastic cups and expensive warm beer and cheap wine (at a not so cheap price). Tables dirty and rubbish piled up - no idea why such a dank place exists in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Don\u2019t",
          "The Bar is well situated, fantastic view. Everything is completely overprized, e.g. beer (0,3 l) for 50 Kn. The decoration is poor as well. If you want to enjoy the view, grab a beer at the supermarket and sit on the stairs in front of the bar...",
          "Look for the hole in the south wall for the Buza bar. And bring swimwear id you are ready to cliff dive. There is not much space and itcan be busy. By there is a constant flow and you will probably find a good spot after smite minutes.",
          "Walk by the old city's walls on your right hand side as you enter town and you will see a whole in the wall! There it is! Sit down, order a drink and enjoy the view of the Adriatic! You can also walk down a few stairs and sunbathe or even swim there! A bit expensive but",
          "Both of these cliff bars are interesting and worth going to for the experience. But try to hit a quiet period as they can be rammed and difficult to find a seat. Also certain tourists keep moving tables to get closer to the edge of the cliff where you have a good view of the",
          "So we had heard so many fantastic things about Buza we decided to go on our last evening in Dubrovnik for celebratory drinks. We arrived to an over crowded bar, the barman greeted us by telling us that they had run out of half of their menu of drinks, we ordered 2drinks and we",
          "We paid 70 kunas for 2x25 cl coke and asked the waiter several times to clean our table. He failed to do so and seemed more interested in chatting with girls in the bar. Finally we had to do it ourselves. Also, half of the bar is close to the toilet and really stinks of piss -",
          "The view is lovely. They play fun music in the background and a nice stop to grab a quick drink with a view. However the bathroom is disgusting and the waiters have a terrible attitude.",
          "I first came to this cliff side bar about 12 or more years ago. I was taken here for sunset by a local and remember being bowled over by this tiny secret cliff side venue and drinking chilled wine from a glass... I\u2019ve sent quite a few friends on a mission to find it in recent",
          "Having never been to Dubrovnik before we read up on its top attractions in guide books in advance of travelling, and Buza was highly rated as a \"must see\". Therefore we sought it out on our first visit to the walled city, but we were totally underwhelmed! Access is difficult",
          "There's a limited choice of drinks, & peanuts are the only food option - it's also difficult to find a seat, but when you do, it's well worth it - the bar clings to the rocks just outside the city walls, & there's a constant stream of boats, kayaks & other marine vessels passing",
          "Smelly, filthy, expensive, plastic cups, packed, surly staff. Nice view. Should have been romantic but so not!",
          "The only good thing? The View. Don\u2019t waste your time and money on this bar whereby the waiters and waitresses have 0 manners. 30 degree heat today and although they have about 15 umberellas - we were shouted at to put these down when we put this up. No explanation as to why.",
          "The drinks in service here or mediocre at best, and the prices are very high ...... But the views here are very impressive and on like pretty much any other bar in the area. The views alone make it worth the trip, if you have time you should check it out. The fact that they had",
          "Excited of coming to this cafe but very very disappointed with the service. Not so many seats available, but when we finally found empty seats, took ages to get attention from waiters/waitresses until I finally tapped a waiter and asked him if he could see me. They don\u2019t seem to",
          "Nothing special. View was ok but it seemed like everyone was crammed in, paying over the odds and convincing themselves they were experiencing something magical. The white wine was warm and the request for ice was greeted with \u2018we don\u2019t have ice\u2019. Ticked the box, jumped on the",
          "We stumbled upon this bar on the old city walls by accident. The drinks are a little bit expensive but the view was simply amazing.",
          "Our family stopped here after a hot walk along the city walls. The place was packed so we worked our way down to the water. We had fun jumping off the rocks and swimming in the Adriatic. Buza II is a gem!",
          "Be prepared paying the jackpot for a bottle of beer but be amazed by the amazing view. Trust me, it is worth it! Go around sunset and enjoy this amazing scenery!",
          "This bar is approached through the city wall and it clings to the cliff top. The sea view is good but finding a seat can be a challenge. The clientele is young and they are willing to pay the high prices for beer. The makeshift toilet is disgusting.",
          "Positives: the setting of this place is excellent and the views are fantastic. You can watch people cliff jumping, you can cheer them on, and some may get even braver as a result. Fun for an hour. Negatives: you cannot book and seats are limited, the toilets are disgusting and",
          "Great view and basic drinks in bottles. Music ok - vistas brilliant... beautiful views of the Adriatic. Delightful staff and lovely vibe.",
          "This place is crowded (like the rest of old town), but if you can manage to find a spot along the water you can sit for hours and just enjoy the view! It so beautiful and relaxing even with the crowds! And the walk to get to the \"hole in the wall\" bar is all part of the",
          "We went to Cafe Buze a number of times during our stay in Dubrovnik. The staff are all lovely young people and do a great job. The view is spectacular, particularly during a lightning storm, but it is just a great place to sit and watch the world go by. It is very busy in summer",
          "The views are super nice from the terrace, even if the prices are much higher than normal. The drinks were warm.",
          "Jumped 30-40ft, still here writing this review. Exhilarating, bit of a scramble to ledges! Poor for drinks. No ice, served warm-ish in plastic cups. Too many people here, service not up to it. Nice view. Go to other similar bar, just more civilised with service, glasses and",
          "There are 2 Buza bars in Dubrovnik. This one, which we didn't like because it was very busy and people were sitting shoulder to shoulder. Perhaps the price was cheaper here (not sure). The other one is called Mala Buza Bar located further east and you will get more space",
          "This is an absolute must when you visit Dubrovnik. Perfect spot for an evening drink or a break from walking around the city by day. The view of the Adriatic Sea is lovely with quick service and reasonable prices. We went almost daily during our stay.",
          "Attractive only to a millennial age group in search of warm beer and indifferent attitude. Cafe Buza manages to take a world-class setting, outside the ramparts of the Old City with spectacular full-on views of the Adriatic, and deliver an experience in utter mediocrity. No ice",
          "Set into the outside of the wall Buza has excellent views, particularly at sunset when the boats are coming back in. I managed to get a seat both times. Their drinks menu is a bit restrictive, so most people were drinking the local beer in plastic cups but I was fine with",
          "The bar itself is pretty basic - just some fridges with beer, wine and soft drinks - but being located just outside the Old Town walls facing the sea makes it very special. The relaxing atmosphere and views mean you could spend all evening there.",
          "Prior to arriving in Dubrovnik I read about this place & got so excited when I saw the sign. The views are beautiful and it's a nice place to stop when walking around the Old Town. The menu is pretty basic but satisfied our needs and the view can't be beat - right on the",
          "Early evening visit found warm beer and a number of drinks on the menu that were unavailable. Very disappointed.",
          "One of our group had heard about this bar but we only stumbled upon it by accident when we were walking around the top of the old town. There\u2019s only a very small sign that reads \u2018cold drinks\u2019, it should read hidden oasis. A series of steps brings you down to a little cliff side",
          "You sit outside the city walls looking over the water and Lokrum island. Stunning. Plenty of parasols to protect you from the sun. Didn\u2019t think the drinks were too expensive given the location - 42KN for a beer. Cash only. Music started off as reggae versions of 90s music (which",
          "Great view of the ocean on the cliff outside the old town wall. Drinks are inexpensive and people are layback. The drinks are not cold at night and the toilet is disgusting.",
          "After being recommended to go to this place I was very disappointed by the music, I love a chilled vibe but this music made me age 10 years listening to it!! I am on holiday and \u00a312 for 2 drinks in plastic cups!! I get you are limited as to what you can get delivered here but",
          "A lovely spot for a drink to chill and soak up the fab views. The bar itself is nothing special and the staff continually hunt down empty bottles to make sure you keep buying more. Limited drink options ... but that said it's worth a visit for somewhere a bit different",
          "Expensive food but if you are keen on a drink and don't mind paying a bit more I would recommend it as you could spend a whole day here!",
          "Expensive drinks and rather busy! When we got a seat the view was stunning. Great to watch the adrenaline junkies jump from the cliffs!",
          "Fabulous setting to catch a few rays, a drink and soak up the sunning view... Definitely worth a visit..",
          "Go for the great view and a relaxing drink, but expect tourist prices. Beer and wine are individual bottles, ok selection of beer, wine is pretty average (selection and taste). Music went from Ed Sheeran to Croatian chart toppers (I presume) at volumes that allowed",
          "Drinks are very expensive, and it served in the plastic cup.. It wrote on the drinks card \"fresh fruit juice\", actually it was a \"Pago\" industrial juice.. The waiter spilled a half cup of soda on my t-shirt. Naturally I asked to have some water to clean my clothes, but he gave",
          "A lovely time out moment from the hussle and bustle of the Old Town, yes it is a bit expensive but so are most places in Dubrovnik, worth a drink for the view and to just chill out!",
          "So I\u2019m sure we just had a bad experience. Server was a cocky little guy. Brought us a warm beer that tasted like it had gone hot/cold/hot/cold one too many times. The view was fantastic but the server and the beer kind of ruined the experience. There are too different Buza",
          "This bar is tucked away within the ols city walls of Dubrovnik. It is slightly pricier than the other bars in the city and the staff do seem to lack basic customer service skills however it is worth it for the excellent views. The bar is built in to the cliff side and is a",
          "The ideal spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of the old town. Just 5 mins yet it feels like a lifetime away.",
          "Nice location to have a beer next to the sea with a nice view. You can watch the boats and go for a swim.",
          "Great location and very cool bar. Gorgeous views of Lokrum Island. BUT as others have said, you serve all your beers in bottles, no-one needs a plastic cup to go with it.",
          "It's just too sad and too irresponsible to run a bar with only plastic cups, specially in such a touristy part of the old town. My partner and I were pretty excited to have a beer in such a prime location but we couldn't. Plastic is a massive problem nowadays and it seems to me",
          "A friend and I were exploring Dubrovnik and came across this bar. It was very busy so we decided to bring our drinks down to the viewing platform and sit on the rock. We didn't mind as we wanted to take photos but if you wanted to sit on a chair the chances were very slim.",
          "We were just wandering around Dubrovnik when we came across this little gem. We had no idea what to expect and it was a gorgeous little cliff side bar, how ideal for a beautiful day. We stopped for a drink and sat admiring the views, it speaks for itself. You could also take a",
          "Nailed on, a bar to head to. A little hidden gem with awesome views and friendly staff. Don\u2019t drink too much, or you may end up throwing yourself off the rocks into the sea for a bet. Search for directions via the internet, you won\u2019t be disappointed...",
          "Indescribably beautiful sitting with an ice cold Ozujsko beer watching boats tootle past! Friendly helpful service and comfortable seating.",
          "Nice, cool, relaxed. Perfect spot for a drink while the sun sets and the night begins. I will recommend this place to my freinds.",
          "Great view point overlooking the sea and lokrum island. Watch the boats go by. Must a good place for sunsets.",
          "Situated on the outside of the south walls of the city overlooking the ocean to sit and chill and escape the hustle and bustle of the town. The \u201cshack\u201d Toilet is not the greatest mind! Good Sunbathing and Sunset Spot",
          "fun little hole in the walls of the big city, the beers were the most expensive ive ever seen. i nearly bought one but realised you can just sit on the rocks adn swim without buying one. the view and location was so epic and it was the cafe online reviews/photos that got us",
          "Cafe Buza (otherwise known as Buza 2) is bar located on the outside of the city walls in Dubrovnik. The beer here is overpriced, especially as it isn't always cold, and it can get very busy. That said it's a great way to have a quick drink with fantastic views as well as being",
          "The drinks may be slightly overpriced, but honestly it's the view (and the chance to maybe jump into the beautiful waters below) that you're paying for. Just grab a cheaper beer or shandy, grab a seat and relax!",
          "Let's start by saying that my senior citizen husband hated Buza ll. Too on- the -edge, unpredictable, a precarious staircase, plastic lawn chairs. And the music was not to his taste. But for us other three travelers, those qualities only added to the charm of this amazing,",
          "Buza bar is tucked away and offers great views out to sea and reasonably priced drinks although with a limited selection",
          "My friends and I first spotted this little caf\u00e9 on a cliff as we walked along the top of \"The Wall\" in April 2017. We just had to find it! The caf\u00e9 was hard to find but well worth the effort. We sipped coffee while enjoying a spectacular view of the Adriatic coast and nearby",
          "Great location, great views, but...... The toilets are shockingly bad, even more so when the outrageous prices are factored in. It's not clear where the toilets are, until you at pointed to them. Then: They are unisex chemical camping toilets They STINK They were overflowing",
          "The only saving grace is the view it offers and for those who are diving enthusiasts then it\u2019s an ideal location as it\u2019s arguably owes its popularity in part to that. But, beyond the views and the diving it\u2019s absolutely not worth it and everything is terribly overpriced and the",
          "Visited while on holiday with my girlfriend. Really nice little place. Was a quiet getaway from the touristy old town. Was nice to relax and have a few beers and take in the amazing views. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Yes, for what they are, the drinks are a little pricey, but this is a gem of a location which more than makes up for the basics. Get here early if you want a table and chairs to watch the sunset, or grab a beer and go down to,sit on the rocks. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Had heard about 2 Buza bars - finally found 1st one , but was not serving drinks , due to onset of approaching storm. So carried on searching for 2nd one, which when we got there , definitely serving drinks, & even got a front row seat of the bar level, drinks pricey but great",

          "Not knowing about Cafe Buza before arriving in Dubrovnik, we spotted the sign reading \u201cCold drinks with the most beautiful view\u201d while strolling around the old town. The bar was absolutely packed the first two times we visited, but we finally got a table on our penultimate day",
          "Had 4 drinks in small plastic cups (2 small beers and 2 wines) \u00a337! Outrageously expensive. Pitch black and poor service. No receipt so think they make the prices up as euros different to kuna. Beware!",
          "Paid the equivalent of \u00a312 (96Kn) for two small bottles of beer (we just came from Zagreb where two large beers was under \u00a35). Yes the sunset is nice, but that\u2019s about all it\u2019s got going for it.",
          "A nice find! Relaxed casual bar through a hole in the wall on a cliff face offering wine & beer in bottles. A bit pricey but when you're on holiday you should try something new at least once a day. Nice place for a relaxing drink any time of the day but if you can make it for",
          "This was my fourth time visiting this bar. I went to Dubrovnik with friends this time and had told them how great this bar was. So I took them to have a drink there. My friend went up to buy three wines which came to \u00a320 (a bit pricey) she made a remark about the cost and the",
          "Great little niche, offers some much welcome respite from heat and exertions of uphill hike. Tranquil spot. Yes, drinks are priced exhorbitantly, so are snacks ( 5 Canadian fora pa ket of peanuts).but the business is small, cliff niche is limited, pricing quickly rids the place",
          "Pretty cool little place. Walk through a hole in the wall and there it is on a cliff. Beers are very expensive. Jumped off a cliff into the ocean which is pretty cool.",
          "A must do visit. It's not smart but stunning views. Plenty of seating and what a place to have a beer. Only bottled beers. Set on a couple of layers but you can usually get a seat.",
          "There is no denying that Cafe Buza is situated in a great location and features a spectacular view, but I think it's a victim of its own hype. The beers are cold, but pricey, they haven't really done anything to beautify the premises and the smell from the toilets was stinking",
          "Plastic glasses aside. The place to watch the sunset. Look for the sign mentioning the beautiful view and then make your way through the small gate in the city wall. Turnover is pretty quick, especially at cruise ship departure time!",
          "We were pleased to find the buza bar after all the hype online. However we walked in and around but the price for a beer was outrageous. There didn't seem any reason to stay as there was other places to see the sea. Vomit on the ground by the entrance didn't enhance the",
          "Read some of the reviews before hand and some were good and some not and thought we would try it. The views are beautiful, but the drinks were very over priced and it was very packed with people. Not many option to sit. Probably the worse place we had drinks in Dubrovnik, but",
          "OK, so it is crowded, noisy, a little expensive, and the drink menu is limited... but I would definitely go to Buza again! The view is great, the vibe is lively ... have a drink, it's a great way to take a break, take in the views, and relax after all the walking and climbing",
          "Pretty basic with limited drinks & plastic cups, but what you go for is the views. Spectacular at sunset, sat in the bar, watching the sun dip into the sea, with classics music playing. Not sure if it was pure luck, but one of the songs reached its final crescendo right at the",
          "The views are sublime and there's a wee set of stairs down to the water which makes it great for swimming. We paid 100 krona (\u00a312) for two bottles of beer and I reckon the waiter added 20 krona to have as a sneaky tip. There is no pricelist on the wall so we were none the wiser",
          "Come here for sunset, you can literally have your drinks on the rocks. Come early to get the best tables.",
          "Like many, had seen the reviews and been recommended not to miss cafe Buza. We arrived around 5pm a few hours ahead of sunset. It was very busy, but we found a small table at the front and settled down. Service was good, quick and friendly, they only offer local beer or wine",
          "Had read great reviews on another site that this was a welcome break from the tourist centre and not too expensive. The views are nice and it's a mellow vibe but it's pretty scruffy, with plastic cups and disinterested staff. Complete rip off prices mean I would go back. Wish we",
          "Absolutely breathtaking view. Picture perfect! This place is magical. We really didn't experience the service so I can't say anything about that!",
          "209 Kuna (nearly \u00a328!) for 3 small beers and a wine. Beware!! Get a receipt first. They charge you afterwards and are not clear on the pricing. On a plus side: the view is nice though, but the sting of the pricing spoils the experience.",
          "\u00a394 Kuna for two warm beers in a place that smells like piss, AVOID. There are much better bars right by the harbour in old town that are sooo much cheaper!",
          "The place could be very nice, but its overexploit for the tourists, so you hace no space, the waiters look tired and not friendly! super expensive!!! not worth a visit",
          "I went to Cafe Buza to see City Walls from different perspective and to enjoy the view above the cliff. Since it was crowded at the cafe, I didnt even have possibility to take a seat but enjoyed the amazing views standing there for 10 minutes.",
          "1. Rip off, even for the view 2. Place is a run down dive 3. Toilets should have the place shut down. You have to walk through a stream of urine which is coming from the porter potty. This is then being trampled through the bar. Honestly couldn't get out of there quick enough",
          "Having fought our way down the steps to the bar and having been so looking forward to visiting this bar, we were both extremely disappointed. Not only at the total lack of atmosphere, which is mainly due to the total carnage of a queueing system; there isn't one. But also after",
          "Cafe Buza was on my \"must-do\" list for Dubrovnik. But unfortunately it was disappointing. The views, of course, were amazing, but it was SO crowded and claustrophobic (and we went at an off time). Service was just ok and drink selection kind of stunk.",
          "What can I say, the view is absolutely incredible and that's about it! It's such a shame the bar staff tried to over charge us for four beers, luckily I overheard the barman serving the couple before us for two beers and clocked onto the fact he almost doubled the price for us.",
          "Buza bar is literally a hole in the wall gem! Such a great spot to spend the afternoon. Serves quick and efficient drinks (local beers and individual personal bottles of wine, served with a plastic cup). Also stairs go down the cliff sides where customers and visitors alike are",
          "I was wandering around the Old Town with my boyfriend and we just stumbled upon this place. Advert was \"cold drink amazing views\" it didn't disappoint. The view from this bar was amazing and drinks were indeed cold although a bit pricey (42 kuna for a 330ml bottle of local beer)",
          "Definitely worth a drink to take in the lovely view. It's quite a noisy, beach style bar but we were happy to have a glass of wine there in the afternoon to take in the sights. We were two friends but it would be a nice spot for couples in the evening. It was quite busy but you",
          "Massively overpriced, loud bar with nothing going for it but the view. If you want to sit in a cramped bar listening to the radio on loud, surrounded by drunk stag/hens then go here.",
          "Went here for a drink this evening and it's possibly the worst place I've ever been. The bar is situated on the cliff side and has amazing views but that's where the appeal ends. Drinks are extortionately overpriced 99 kuna (approx \u00a313) for a coke and a red wine both served",
          "Can't see why people rave about this place it's a little , bordering on scruffy, bar on a cliff edge. The place is littered with cigarette ends and discarded plastic cups. The 'view' basically looks out over the island of korcula which is the same you can see off the harbour",
          "This bar located on a cliff edge outside the old town walls has lovely views, but the drinks are extortionately overpriced.",
          "Just thieves we got 3 juices and 1 beer and they charged us 178 kuna When I asked for proof after being persistent and immaculate that I would bring the police gave me the receipt where I realized they had charged me 3 juices and two beers and they returned me back 42 Finally I",
          "Having been duped like so many others to visit, the setting doesn't disappoint, just the lack of managing the narrow cliff edge, as piles of litter bags, bottles and garbage shrewd everywhere, busy place with no friendly staff, some parts of the little flat bar area looked",
          "This could be so much more! Whilst you get amazing views and friendly staff. You pay an overinflated price for drinks. A recommendation would be don't use the toilet facilities or look what they do with their rubbish if you respect the ocean!",
          "By the time we visited Trgovina Buza, we were well used to Dubrovnik's \"tourist prices\". But this was just a whole other level of extortion. I wonder when I'll learn to ask the prices in advance, rather than just trusting that business owners will be fair, if only because they",
          "This was a great place to unwind midday but I can imagine it gets very busy towards the end of the day. Drink selection is not great but you're there for the views not the drinks.",
          "Amazing views out to the sea but they charge 42 kuna for a small 33cl beer. The standard in Croatia is 13-17.",
          "Came to buza bar based on lots of recommendations. It was absolutely packed which we didn't mind at first, but added with extortionately priced warm bottled beer (54 kuna each), poor service and sitting amongst the cliff edges which were totally littered with beer bottles left",
          "Called in at about 1130 on Sunday and we were lucky that there were a few spare seats although things got busier later. There is no drinks menu and no price list but it isn't cheap. We had bottled beers and soft drinks which were around \u00a315-\u00a320. There's a great view of Lokrum",
          "We had been looking forward to going to Buza Bar in Dubrovnik, probably the most out of anywhere! We decided to go just after lunch, when a storm was imminent (hoping there would be less people) and had not anticipated the hoards of crowds (mainly Americans/Australians) that",
          "Nice bar outside of the city walls and friendly bar staff. The five star review is given as reward for the worst toilet I have ever visited. Even Glastonbury toilets don't have 4 turds sitting on top the toilet! The smell of excrement leaking down the rocks into the sea coupled",
          "The place is beautiful and unique, with a great view , but had a lack of drinks and was extremely overpriced. Two simple cider bottles cost 116 Kuna! That's about 15\u20ac! And in a plastic cup! In the supermarket you can buy them for a tenth of the price. The place had no menu cards",
          "One of the most glorious spots in Dubrovnik with a view worth a thousand sighs. The sea is wide and infinite as viewed from here. You can order only beer or water here! The spot is always bustling because it has one of the best views in the city. People also cliff dive from",
          "The best about this bar is it's location, at the coast, by the sea, on the rocks, through the city walls, really special and amazing feeling while you sitting and having various kinds of drinks. P.s. cocktails are very nice.. prices are affordable, but the ambience is so",
          "The staff was very rude, no patience with customers. Sat near the bar and could hear them making fun of the customers. This is a place you should def go see but staying for a drink is hopefully a better experience than the one we had.",
          "Not a wide range of drinks options available for a cocktail/wine lover like myself. But nonetheless worth the visit for a cold beer/house white to enjoy the atmosphere and view. Busy place so might have to wait a little while for a free table.",
          "Very cool environment, a bar literally situated cliffside that you can walk down and jump in the Med. So much potential for an amazing bar but it is not. Only bottled beer, only cash. Still worth it though for the location!",
          "This is one of just a few places to grab a drink with a view outside the city walls. The prices were expensive but the view was stunning. I have rated 3 stars as somewhere that charges this much for drinks should at least have sanitary toilet facilities. This does not. The",
          "Great for a brief stop to enjoy stunning views over the coast. Also a place fir the brave to jump off into the sea! Service average and range of drinks not huge so would not recommend for a long stop.",
          "The view is nice but the offer of drinks is disappointing! like 4-5 drinks!!?? You have all over the city banners with \"cold drinks and the most beautiful view\" but you serve drinks almost room temperature, in plastic cups and have no ice??? Typical Croatian scam!",
          "Pros: great views. Cons: trashy service. Waiters treated all like garbage. I have been to places, lived in several places globally ( New York City, Spain, etc) stayed long and short term. I have never been or have seen people be so humiliated by a staff until I walked in here.",
          "We knew beforehand the 2 Cafe Buza locations didn't offer food more were they going to be bargains but we wanted to see the cliffhanging location on the outside of the walls of Old Dubrovnik. We had a general idea where they were and the tiny entrance that opened to narrow",
          "First things first you might think this may be a mistake but my god was it not. My girlfriend and I ordered one small beer and one wine which we were told came to 91 kuna. I only had a 200 and the small brunette girl gave me two notes and a hell of a lot of change so I assumed",
          "It's just an expensive bar outside the wall on the old city. You can go to some other bar on top of the wall of the old city. The service is low quality. No food and a lot of smokers. Sincerely... big disappointment. You can have the same view from a lot of places, so why pay a",
          "The view is good but it's even better from the city walls... They have small chemical toilets that smell incredibly bad. And worst of all: we overheard the couple behind us was given back 20 Kuna less than they should have received - and the same happened to us five minutes",
          "The view is nice but the drinks are expensive for bottles of beer and alcopops. The toilets were awful, overflowing down the rocks with no hand washing facilities.",
          "We went in for an afternoon drink. Their choices are limited, which makes sense considering the high traffic and how little space they have. A bit too pricy seeing as it's not fancy at all. But if you get a good table the views are nice, and there was kind of a buzzing",
          "Not the easiest place to find - starting from the harbour in the old town, keep to the left and look for a small doorway in the walls with a sign that reads 'Cafe Buza - cold drinks with a beautiful view'. After passing through the small doorway ( feels like a scene from a Harry",
          "The view is lovely but the place is a dive. You get served drinks in plastic cups and there is litter all over the place. The furniture is dated and not comfortable. This place has so much potential but it is pretty poor at the moment.",
          "Worth a look, but drinks are served in white plastic cups which litter the floor around you, some get blown into the beautiful Aegean, the one reason most of us attend. Also they have no price list on display, the choice isn't exhaustive so even a blackboard would do the",
          "Went there in the night. Nothing of a great view to watch, they could do w some ambient lighting. The place looks awful, chairs are old and worn, toilets are awfully filthy to non existent, beers and water were hot. I'm sure they've got a great spot but they have to try a lot",
          "Stopped here for a short while and enjoyed the views and watching the adrenaline filled people jump off the cliffs. The noise of impact on the water was intriguing. The cups are plastic, but I'd imagine this is down to cleaning and the safety element due to the constant flow",
          "We visited here on our last visit to Dubrovnik. The weather wasn't too good and we said we'd return. It's still tricky to find but this place is no longer a secret. You'll be lucky to find a seat and if you do, don't be expecting a vast drinks menu. They do beer, wine and a few",
          "This place seems to be overhyped. Lots of people but the view is really the only thing going for it. The beer was very expensive and could have been colder. You could not pay by card and the toilet was just a shack with no water or paper. We saw other people sitting on the rocks",
          "No price lists.... \u00a35 per drink which were pretty awful in terms of selection and what you could have in other bars for half the price Basic Plastic cups .... Waitress with an attitude Steer clear of this place! Clearly wanting to make a quick buck ..cheap and nasty god knows",
          "Today I visited BUZA a bar in the Old City of Dubrovnik with the 'most beautiful views'. Agreed the view was beautiful though I only got a small window of opportunity to see these 'views' due to the traffic of people pouring in and (wisely) out. After being shoe horned onto",
          "Ok, so the view here is as good as it gets, however they regularly run out of things, and the prices are outrageous for what you get. Top tip, don't order an iced coffee, you'll get a shot of cold coffee in a plastic vending machine cup. If you're going in for a couple of beers",
          "Yes the beers are a bit over priced here. But myself and my wife had a great time looking at the views and watching people jump off the rocks. The views are magnificent. And it's a fun place to hang out.",
          "Great location let down by warm beer and only beer wine and soft drinks I can understand it must be hard to get your drinks to the bar and to keep it all chilled in the warm conditions but its something the owner should maybe look into resolving",
          "The place has good views if you can get a table, but we were served warm beer at a price of 52 HRK each, which is not acceptable To top it all, they don't accept credit cards, and do not try to go to the 'rest room' Service was fast though, as I guess they are printing money",
          "As going to a place for the first time, we always follow people's advice and website's ratings and reviews. For this place, it was a big mistake! Cold drinks only, no cocktails or any other alcohol, you either drink a beer or a beer! Place is too crowed, if it\u00b4s for the view,",
          "Me and my boyfriend were wandering around dubrovnik old town and found a plaque saying \"cold drinks in the most beautiful view\". Sounded good idea. Well, not so much...it was super overcrowded with no seats available but we stayed and asked for 2 beers that were not cold at all.",
          "Great view below the city walls, good concept but no longer a \"secret.\" Very busy, fun with people jumping into the sea but as sunset approaches it is mobbed. Prices are high, you are lucky if you can get a table. Service was pretty good considering. Not suitable for children",
          "It is all about the view. Come here for that and enjoy yourself. Go almost anywhere else for better prices.",
          "Don't go here expecting anything fancy. It's cheap furniture, crowded and has London priced drinks but the atmosphere is great and it's a nice place to shade from the heat. The views are spectacular and in the day it's full of young people enjoying a drink and jumping off the",

          "Expect London prices, staff who would rather you weren't there and a fight for a table. Loved the eighties vibe playlist, but it's clearly an iPod or a tape, the songs don't even fade into one another. No money has been spent on this place.",
          "We visited in early June 2017 and had an enjoyable time having a drink with beautiful view. It is difficult to find but worth the effort. We went to the other Cafe Buza first but it was out in the sun and exposed. The second one was where we settled in for a drink. It was",
          "This place is really average.... unless you take a trip to the toilets and then it gets a whole lot worse. The staff were uninterested, forgot to bring us our change, took another 2 reminders. The prices were ridiculous and to add insult to injury..... the toilets. Where do I",
          "Buza bar is definitely worth a visit if even for one drink as it is quite overpriced and the toilet facilities is basically just a portable loo that doesn't flush as the bar is carved into the side of the cliff. You can relax watching people cliff dive from the spot below and",

          "\"Buza Bar\" or \"Hole in the Wall\" as many call it, has the most unbelievable views of the ocean. This is a must visit during your time in Dubrovnik, but please, come for the vistas, not for the drinks or drink prices. Highly recommend doing a cocktail in the evening as the",
          "This is a tatty little bar, basic seating,' cheap furniture' there has been no money spent here. There were six of us so it was also difficult to sit together, 5 bottles of beer and one apple juice \u20ac45!!!!\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 Find somewhere else to get a cold drink",

          "My friend and I went to Buza Bar because we just had to check it out. It's totally touristy, but the view is amazing! There was a crowd leaving when we arrived, so we were able to get a good seat. Our 4 beers were pretty darn expensive (168 kuna, which is about $26 American).",
          "Nice view and concept (you can go to swim from the bar) but the prices are ridiculous. Other big minus was that the drinklist consisted only of beer, cider and breezer when we visited this place.",

          "This terrace bar would get four Stars even if they sold poison. The view from the terrace is something I've never experienced before. it's remarkable. If you would take someone here on a first date it would be totally rude if you didnt get lucky that night. The only downside is",
          "Not cheap but you pay for the view. Nice way to cool off from the heat of the city with a nice sea breeze. Small bathroom with limited choice of drinks. Busy so hard to get a good seat but quite a bit of turnover so be patient.",
          "Wow. Some friends suggested we try to find this place and we are not disappointed with out efforts. It is a small place which you need a good map or luck to find, fortunately we had a bit of both. Beers, ciders and wines are all available. Everything came with a plastic cup but",
          "This was recommended in Rick Steves guidebook. There is another buza similar to this but this Buza II is suppose to be the better one. Best spot in town for a scenic drink. Little shade so bring sunscreen or a hat. Establishment takes credit cards or cash. Can order at the bar",
          "The views are nice but the place is an absolute rip off... over 7 Euros for a cheap small bottle of local beer...smelly dirty toilet and very casual sitting... also they only give u a bill if u explicitly ask for it before paying... otherwise they ll tell you the amount you have",
          "Another place my boyfriend and I stumbled across whisky meandering the streets of old town. We were thirsty and there was a sign which said \"cold drinks, good views\" so we followed eagerly. They weren't wrong. The view was stunning!!! It was lovely to sit down, relax and soak",
          "Absolute rip off, 109KN, (\u00a314), for a packet of peanuts and two small beers which to add insult to injury weren't very cold and were served with a cheap plastic cup. There are plenty of alternative places to get a great view and it will cost you nothing. Had a fabulous full",

          "Fantastic views of the sea in the blazing sunshine makes it totally worth the higher drink price to sink a few beers here. Admittedly a bit of a tourist trap but that's Dubrovnik as a whole, so enjoy one of the best bits and take it at fave value! Stunning views and a very",
          "I wish I'd read the reviews on here before visiting rather than being swept up by a 'cool cave bar with great views'. Great views yes but that's it. There's a lot of people in a very small space and if you don't get a front row seat, the only view you'll get is the back of",
          "I liked the view from the Buza bar. It wasn't what I was expecting from other reviews. The drinks were minimal and what you did get was a boxed drink. They didn't have any food at this place either. It was really crowded and was hard to find seats. When you did sit down you",
          "We were recommended this place by our tour guide but we found the views to be no better than those on the walls, it was so busy we couldn't get a seat at the cliff edge anyway so only views were the back of peoples heads and the drinks were almost double that of other bars in",

          "The view at Cafe Buza is very nice, particularly near sunset. You cannot see sunset from the cafe, but the evening view is still quite nice. We found the servers to be attentive and friendly. Those are the upsides. The less fortunate realities that may make you want to limit",

          "There's not much to it, but you won't experience this type of spot anywhere else in the world. The service was super fast and the selection is good. It's a great spot to take a break, catch the breeze and enjoy a cold drink!",
          "Great find! Set in the cliffs on the edge of the old town overlooking the sea. Great spot for afternoon drinks or to watch the sunset. Surprisingly quiet probably because it's hidden by the old walls so you could easily walk past it. Much nicer than the advertised bar slightly",
          "There are 2 bars hugging the cliff outside the wall about 100metres apart. Easy to confuse the 2 but both are great. The eastern one was a little classier and less crowded with wine from a glass instead of a plastic cup. Both are must see for the view and vibe. One has brave",

          "We found out about Buza bar from a travel show, and glad we did. Nothing like a good swim followed by a cold drink (or vice-versa). The views are spending, the atmosphere is very laid back, and the people are very friendly. If there is one fault with the place is that the",

          "Having read some negative reviews about the venue I wasn't initially going to visit, but having walked the walls and seen the position of the bar, I thought I would give it a try. It's true that the drinks are pricey, and there are some pretentious patrons, but these are both to",

          "Buza sits on the side of a cliff facing south, southwest. There are a small number of tables and a bar; bathroom, not so much! The excellent rating is for location and views. However, you will not get better sunsets in all of Croatia. Pick the time, get there an hour before",
          "This place is a little tricky to find, but worth the search! You have to hike up to the top of the city walls, but once you're there it's great. There are amazing views of the sea and you can sit and have a drink and enjoy the view and watch the cliff divers jump. I great",
          "The view is delightful up here, like the most of Croatia. I would recommend to go and take a visit. It can be very busy and there are many people and staff rushing around. I would assume its quite expensive and touristy due to its location etc. Do visit though and ideally go at",

          "This is a must do whilst visiting the old town! Fantastic setup overlooking the sea - bit of a trek to the bottom of the old town to get here but well worth it. You can relax and watch the sunset whilst watching the boats and a few cliff divers jump into water.",
          "We stumbled upon this little place whilst exploring the old town of Dubrovnik. It's very popular and understandably so, the views are spectacular, the beers are ice cold so grab a seat and watch the world go by, oh and the 'jumpers' of course \ud83d\ude1c",
          "You won't find signs to get there, but most vendors in the walled city can point you along the way. You finally turn up a set of steps forming a narrow alley, and you eventually come to a rectangular door in the wall, with no sign. Inside the door is an l-shaped alcove which",
          "What a great find and loved watching the sun go down from this very quirky but adorable place. It's accessed through a hole in the first wall and the staircase is steep and narrow. We arrived at 5pm and waited on the rocks for a table and chairs to become vacant. Well worth the",
          "Very nice and romantic place but; No tap water, toilet smell on the terrace. One speaker (near the exit) works. Overpriced drinks. Beer price is 8 euros, no glass but plastic cup. Seven beers on the menu, only two are available. Be aware of the mosquito bites. ~ AMBIENCE: \u2606\u2606 ~",
          "This bar in the cliffs of old town Dubrovnik was the perfect spot to rest weary legs after a long day sight seeing. Such a chill out vibe thanks to an awesome soundtrack. Even our kids 8yrs and 12 yrs enjoyed watching all the life in the sea that just drifts by... Posting photos",
          "The \"hole in the wall\" leads you to this amazing panorama view bar nestled on the rocks outside the old walls of Dubrovnik over looking the Adriatic Ocean. It appears that some reviewers on this site somehow were under the impression that there is a \"diving\" show here provided",
          "Nice enough bar, but it is rammed for the sunset so we couldn't really enjoy it. Just isn't worth going. So many other places to relax and enjoy the sunset but if you don't mind being squashed in then go for it...",
          "Attracts many visitors for the view but staff are extremely rude. The drinks are overpriced, ordered a glass of white wine and can honestly say it;s the worst I've ever tasted. Left it behind. There are much nicer places to view the sunset so I'd give this place a wide berth.",
          "This was a really great bar, overpriced but it offered really good views and was really beautiful at sunset. We stayed for one drink and watched some people go for a swim off the rocks.",
          "Had planned to go to this cafe/bar the minute we saw it situated precariously on a cliff face while sailing, but did not realize how lucky we were to have chosen to go before dinner. Arrived just as the sun was setting and it was the most beautiful sunset we had ever seen in",
          "We came here as a group (18-20 people) for drinks one night. We had a great spot way up on the rocks and watched the sunset and the water traffic (mostly kayaks) and it was great. We were part of a private tour so we really didn't experience the 'service' because we had our",
          "It's set through a small hole in the wall amongst the rocks. Tranquil setting and would of loved to spend some time here but there were no seats free!",
          "Great little hole in the wall (literally) spot to pull up a chair, a few Ozujsko and watch the cliff divers. A cold beer is a bit more expensive here, but the view is fantastic. I did not partake in the cliff jumping/diving, but it's open to anyone who wants to give it a go.",
          "Got drawn into this by hype of brochures and Insight guide. Not very good, overpriced beer. Poor bar selection and now a tourist trap. Toilet is a portaloo. Don't expect much and be prepared to walk away disappointed. Yes the view is nice, but there are much better in",
          "A bit of a struggle to find, literally a hole in a wall (maybe a sign on the outside would be helpful?). Worth the hunt though, packed with people looking to enjoy their drinks with a view. The bartenders have a snappy attitude and the bar was out of wine and margarita glasses",
          "Found by ducking through a tunnel in the city walls this bar is really a collection of seats perched on the rocks above a bathing deck. The views across the bay are sublime and it's a great place to relax from the hustle and bustle inside the city.",
          "You have to go through a hole in the city wall and you will reach the rocks, where you can have a drink in the cafe or have a cool jump into the sea from the rocks. We have down so every night and enjoyed the beautiful views during sunset.",
          "Fantastic location with a stunning view, it isn't cheap but I think given the location it isn't bad value either. Our drinks were cold we didn't eat though. Would definitely seek it out if you are in Dubrovnik.",
          "The location makes it perfect. The view is amazing Totally recommeneded to sit and have a drink and even swim a bit!",
          "Whole new meaning given to having a drink \"on the rocks.\" This seaside bar requires you to duck through a small hole in the city wall and descend a flight of stairs down to it. The journey alone is worth it!",
          "Set on the rocks outside the City of Dubrovniks walls a truly great place for a drink and to soak in the views",
          "We saw this bar from the walls . It looks like it hangs off the cliffs between the City Walls and the Adriatic. The views are amazing. Access is gained via steep steps . The bar was a little short of stock on the day we visited so we could not have our first choice of drinks.",
          "Amazing views It serves cold beers Not cheap but worth the view Don't tell the world:) Make sure you check it out",
          "Warm welcome from a lovely young lady server smiling and friendy. Great views good place to chill. Yes probably more expensive than most places but you are on holiday enjoy its quality not quantity.",
          "I was meeting with a good friend of mine and I wanted to show him an amazing, but hidden place in Dubrovnik. It's positioned on the southern part of the old town, outside of the walls on the cliffs. The beverages are quite expensive, 4,50 Euros for cold drinks and almost 6",
          "The atmosphere, the views and the service are very nice. I could be sitting there for hours. On the down side I will say that it's very pricy, 47 kn (7\u20ac) for a beer that wasn't even cold. Also what happened is that they didn't have half of the things on the menu available. I",

          "Genuinely one of the nicest locations for a cafe I have every been to but it was a shame that the menu was fairly limited and they didn't even have everything on it available. The service was good and it was a place that you could sit at all day and watch the world pass. With a",
          "We stumbled across this 'rock bar' whilst exploring the Old Town. Just below the city walls there is a gap in the fortifications and a wooden sign telling you that there are 'cold drinks' to be had. Maybe the most underrated way of announcing a dramatic location for a bar that",
          "The location is simply the best of any bar in Dubrovnik . Its on a cliff through a hole in the Walls of Dubrovnik When it comes to the menu- Just a few pricey drinks and peanuts . Go there for the view",
          "Loved this place on our first visit to dubrovnik just over 4 years ago, really unimpressed now. We should of knew when there were large advertising boards out for it in the old town, gone are the little wooden signs that just said cold drinks with an arrow. Also gone was the",
          "Beautiful n happening pub , its a must go if you have spare time. Recommended for young people. Afternoon time is better for a beer.",
          "We were told it was a \"hard\" place to find, and that may be their lure to get you in there and have a beer. There also wasn't any cliff jumpers, which was another lure to get us to go there. However, it was a beautiful view, and had there been cliff divers, it would have been",
          "Amazing view from this place and was recommended highly , had couple of beers here and met some lovely people who were on a cruise around med , very busy whilst we were here but plenty of tables , a must have drink stop whilst walking around old town",
          "The bar has an excellent music, view and good vibe, located on the cliffs of Dubrovnik walls, spread on 3 levels. Many people in difficulty of finding a table, buys a beer and sits direct on the rocks. There is even a jumping place into the sea.",
          "You go here for the views which are incredible. Watching people sit on the cliffs or diving into the sea. There are lots of seats you may need to find one in the nooks and crannies of the cliff. The drinks are limited and served in plastic glasses I suspect it's because of the",
          "The bar does not offer many seats so many people end up on the rocks down below. That said, the view is brilliant, especially if you go around sunset.",
          "It's not a big place and everyone wants to be there at the same time! Stunning view but unless you go when it's still hot you won't get a seat!",
          "Ok for a quick beer but they really don't offer more than that. We were glad we stopped in for a half hour and a couple of beers before dinner, to take in the views and quirky setup, but we would have been fine if we didn't make it here either.",
          "This bar squeezed onto the rocks through the city wall is a must for any visitor. Escape the fridge magnet buyers from the cruise ships and sneak a cheeky beer or two perched high above the water in a one of a kind bar. A real gem.",
          "but rest is sad. This place screams for \"take the money from tourists\". pricy drinks and really lousy quality. ice coffee was a joke: you get a mug and 2dl of room temperatured sugar-coffee that you can buy from every market. luckily you can find beer in the bottle (Corona)",
          "Personally I thought this place was pretty cool, I didn't visit the toilets so cannot comment on them like some reviewers have. Don't expect waiters dressed ammaculatly or guilded menu's it a basic fun busy bar on the side of a cliff , yes you may pay a few Kona more for a beer",
          "Great location for a bar Seating is s bit cramped and as a result it's not as relaxed as the sister bar further down the rocks Prices for drinks a but pricy",
          "Visited here 4 times during our 1 week stay in Dubrovnik and to be honest I'd have spent hours in here if only our budged would have afforded it...Your sitting on the rocks on the outside of the wall with a great view out into the Aegean where boats and canoes will pass you by -",
          "Worth a visit to watch the cliff jumpers and take in the view. Beautiful location. Drop in for a cold drink and some crisps.",
          "Best in the cafe at the foot of the walls is the views of the endless blue sea and island of Lokrum . It has a very high cost of drinks ( beer 0.33 45 kn / 8.20 \u20ac ). Dogs are welcome and commend the waiters who bring them water to drink without asking.",
          "Kinda agree with the reviews that state it falls short of expectation. Had been looking forward to it. Service - indifferent is fair. Helpful to a point. Prices - far too high. Two 330ml Staropramen cost 88kn - that's \u00a310. We had asked for a Leffe but they had no cold ones",
          "It's not actually that easy to find this bar and there are a lot of steps up but once there it is worth the view. Downside - nothing other than beer and soft drinks available; they are on the menu just didn't have any! We were entertained by the cliff top jumpers though -",
          "The only advantage of this place is the sea view! No other! I ordered Ice coffe....and got something...seemed Nescafe with milk and water in the cheepest small plastic cup. Already sweet. Indifferent waiters with tired faces. One of them tried to cheat us with the bill. He",
          "This place was packed with people so we had to be a little pushy to even get a table. I'd have to admit the view is amazing overlooking the water but we were really put off how overpriced the drinks were. We were prepared to sit here and treat ourselves to a few rounds but when",
          "I'm glad we went once during our visit, but we were in Dubrovnik for a week. That we were not compelled to go back speaks for itself. It was a nice view to enjoy at sunset, but as others have noted the drinks are on the pricey side and the view available from the walls. Also,",
          "Frankly the view is not worth the awful service, ridiculously overpriced drinks, of which are of an extremely poor selection (Ordered a Cherry Cider, was a small bottle of STRONGBOW cherry, and it cost 47 kuna, nearly \u00a36!) and then to be given plastic cups to drink in! We have",
          "The cafe offers great view at the cliff, and you can see water activities out there. The drinks are very small portion, and only cash is accepted. Not convinient for credit card users.",
          "Fun to sit and have a drink watching the divers off the rocks - plan a half an hour unless you're tired and footsore. Finding a table can be tricky.",
          "We have been so looking forward to this after family and friends recommended, seriously don't bother ! It's peak season, so crowded, expensive and the smell from the port a loo! Yuk. So many other lovely bars and the view ~ well you can get that from several other spots",
          "We arrived when it was fairly slow, and service was OK. It degraded as the place filled up. The prices are above average but so are the views. I would recommend many of the small restaurants along the top of the wall for a comparable view...and those have better prices and",
          "The price in itself may perhaps not be the problem if the service would follow. Just cause I can afford it does not mesn I will pay it if I am treated poorly. Great view from the location and you can dive into the sea off the cliffs there. But such uncomfartable chairs, small",
          "The bar has a limited selection of drinks and the prices are not the best. However, if you go there to buy drinks, you're kind of missing the point. The place really serves as a beach access point for some of the best swimming and cliff diving in Dubrovnik. Also, feel free to",
          "We didn't get a menu to check the prices. The waitress only offered wine and beer in plastic glass. Over 5\u20ac each and didn't even get the bill. Don't go to this place. Only worth for the views.",
          "Went there around 1 am, the music was fantastic, lots of different languagges could be heard, the view with the moon above the water was amazing. Completely different story told at night. Durring the day just another caffe with the good view. Prices- small bottle of water around",
          "Yes the views are amazing but you get the same view from the city walls and the top of the cable car. This bar/cafe has absolutely zero atmosphere and the drinks are more than double the price of anywhere else (83 Kuna for 2 small bottle of beer) Only beer & wine on offer, no",
          "We were told not to miss this experience, and I have to say it was well worth it. Just don't go here b/c you want to get soused. Like most other ppl, we walked the wall (LOVE LOVE LOVE) and then stopped at Cafe Buza. It was so much fun, if you are in a suit you can also jump",
          "The view from the restaurant is excellent. However the variety of drinks is quite limited and during the sunset when we visited all sparkling wine was already gone. Also a great place to go swimming.",
          "We were told not to miss this place, so we duly obliged! We just had one drink here after walking the city walls, and it was a great idea. I agree with previous contributors that it is pricey, but so worth it. The view and the atmosphere are just everything you want when you're",
          "The drinkas are average and pricy, but the view is worth every penny! Don't miss visiting late at night with the moon lighting up the water.",
          "Cafe Buza may be the coolest venue for a bar/cafe that I've ever seen. Located outside the famous walls of Dubrovnik, there's basically no real reason to want to go back in once you find this place. Perfect place to grab a drink and watch or participate in some amazing cliff",
          "This place has beautiful views and only serves cold drinks, once you are there you will understand why. It is located in the old city wall of Dubrovnik and therefore a bit hard to find but really worth it!",
          "Fantastic views. Hard to find which adds to its charm. Quite expensive. Half a pint of lager and a red wine...\u00a310. Felt like the guy behind the bar was doing me a favour serving me. You know, that 'blas\u00e9 attitude' that seems to be too common nowadays.",
          "Visited for a drink and to relax in the heat of the evening. This is a very nice place in a very nice setting and good to take in the view. As you would expect it is very busy and it goes with the territory. The wine are served in small bottles.",
          "Stumbled across this place accidentally and so glad we did. Incredible views, very chilled out vibe. Music being played was good, not your average Euro pop stuff thankfully! Drinks we about right for Dubrovnik",
          "This is a great place to take a drink and enjoy the view. Its a little hidden so not overcrowded. We were here as a friendgroup and got to see an beautifull moonshine.",
          "located just outside the city walls this is a great location to have a break and enjoy the sea views and watch people cliff jumping. found it by following cold drinks sign from the Jesuit church",
          "Went to this bar as it was highly recommended by every guide book. The bar seemed to be out of every drink on the menu. Place was untidy and in poor repair. I can't even being to describe the port a loo that easy supposed to be a toilet without feeling sick. The views were",
          "Totally recommend to spend a couple of hours in this hidden away place. International crowd but not too touristy, not too expensive and you can go swimming at the beach below.",
          "Cafe Buza has a nice view on Lokrum island but the sunset is not actually in front of this place. The drinks are quite expensive and the stuff is not nice.",
          "The views were excellent! Could have sit there for hours in nice sea breeze and follow all the different kind of boats, kayaks, swimmers and divers. Drinks were really expensive, but worth of it.",
          "This was a must visit on my to do list. Not what I was expecting. There is no question the view was amazing, it was interesting watching people jumping into the sea from the rocks, & the music was chilled. But, the bar options were bottled beer or wine served in plastic cups &",
          "The usp of this bar is the cliff jumping. Adventure enthusiasts just come and Go diving into the sea off the cliff. I gave it a shot too but failed after an hour long of trying. While my friend jumped twice and had the best adrenaline rush - we were really proud of him. Wish I",
          "Great location, good music, bad services -waiters and waitreses too much relaxed and not being profesionals!! They seem to be missing money change all the times. Plastic glasses look really tacky - too expensive for very low level of services!!",
          "We went here to grab a drink after a long day of sightseeing. They have a load of tables and chairs in the shade which was perfect. The selection of drinks was very limited - basically soft drinks, beer, wine. My partner really fancied a cocktail or g&t but they didn't have",
          "We had spotted this place on our walk around the walls and decided it looked a great spot for a drink. Sitting overlooking the sea below we weren't disappointed. The beer menu is not extensive and possibly the most expensive in town but everything has to be brought in by hand",
          "We loved this place. It was a cool experience to sit on a cliff side and have a drink and take in the fab view!! This bar would also be popular for the cliff jumping/ swimming (which can be fun to watch). There is steps the whole way to the bottom (If you are not up for",
          "This bar was recommended by a tour guide because of its 'romantic sunset' however, there is no real view of the actual sunset because it is hidden behind the walls of the old town! Not only did that disappoint us, but the bar had run out of most drinks on both occasions we went-",
          "Had a lovely time sipping on our wine and enjoying the view of the sea from old town Dubrovnik. We really wanted to see the sunset but it was a bit windy and drizzling that day but nevertheless we had a great time at Cafe Buza. The view was absolutely stunning!!",
          "Ok, i get it, popular places are crowded and expensive, but at the very least should justify the cost, this place did no such thing. Paying double here for a bottle of beer than in the restaurant i was in 10 mins before is insane, and it wasnt the best sunset place i had been",
          "Chill atmosphere, generous drinks, views of the islands. It's just really pleasant to seat outside of the wall, drink a cocktail and watch people dive into the bay.",
          "Well worth it for the view alone! Not difficult to find at all 2 big signs which say cold drinks with a beautiful view signposting your way! Drinks are very expensive but worth it for 1 or 2 looking at the view. Lots of people also cliff jumping here so fun to watch.",
          "You should go there just for the view! Everything else is a bonus! We went for a walk in the old city and got there as if we were lured in\u2026didn\u2019t want to leave...",
          "We did the city walls and wanted to chill out with a view of the sea. This was lovely to visit and a simple concept of drinks. The corner however smelt of urine so wasn't always pleasant!",
          "A bit off the beaten track and through a little gate and down some steps you'll find a little bar clinging to the rocks. Everyone wants the very front tables and people jump tables when someone leaves. Not many tables and it can be busy. No rose' wine when I was there but",
          "This cliffside location, which is accessed through a narrow opening that has been carved out of the city wall, offers a tremendous vista of Croatian coastline. Optional extras include a wait for others to vacate the crowded seating, and a limited range of unmemorable yet pricey",
          "Was a great concept, although difficult to find. Very busy with mainly younger customers. Needs some work doing to tidy it, especially the toilets that belong at a festival. With a bit of money spent, will be fantastic but the views were incredible and made up for the negatives",
          "Managed to find this quirky place from following best instructions found Address: Crijevi\u0107eva 9 The easiest way to find Buza Bar, coming from the main street of Stradun, is to climb the wide stairs leading up from Gunduliceva (this is the square with the little outdoor food",
          "Loved this spot. As the sign says cold beers and great views. Can get a little busy and there's not always a great selection of drinks but sitting there at sunset looking out of the water is amazing.",
          "Went there for a quiet drink in the evening with a friend. The view was amazing! Straight out over the water and the moon created a beautiful stairway of light.. gorgeous. Waiters not really attentive and you have to really attract their attention to get them to serve you.",
          "Took some finding but we did it and even found their 2nd bar which is very similar. So cool having to search these places down and then be greeted with the amazing views. Proper sun traps so you need to sit under a parasol. Not cheap to drink there but worth it just to",
          "I can't quite believe all the hype about this place. Yes - views are good. But it's cramped, with cursory service and the drinks are overpriced and come served in disposable plastic cups. The toilet was THE most disgusting experience of my life - and I've been to many a festival",
          "Dropped in for a couple of beers at sunset on our first night in Dubrovnik. Beer is \u00a34 a bottle and service was quick. Great spot. Will be going back.",
          "We hit this bar earlier today and were really happy with the experience. It was 30 degrees, the skies were crystal blue, the water was soooo inviting and we had a front row seat looking across the ocean while indulging in some quiet drinks. The back ground noise was a warm",
          "Buza, as they say means Hole in the wall and literally this is a hole in the wall place, you can easily miss it. The place is buzzing. The location is great and has some scenic view, you can enjoy your drink and the cool breeze. The service is quick but slightly on the rude",
          "Cute place, off of a cliff... Views are probably nice during the day but not much to see at night. Selection of wine is limited but wines were good. Very windy up there, bring a jacket! Romantic spot.",
          "Really cool bar in the old town which is on the outside of the city walls. We went twice on our 3 day trip and the cocktails were lovely, really good selection and about \u00a37 each. Amazing views and was lovely at sun set!",
          "I found this cafe in Dubrovnik 15 years ago and loved to sit and watch the sea lap up onto the rocks and watch the boats go by. 15 years later I visited the cafe again. Easier to find this time as the little hole in the wall that you go through had been sign posted . Still the",
          "Through a little hole in the wall down and down some steps are tables perched on a cliff top with the most beautiful view out from Dubrovnik. It really can't be rivaled. Service however was rubbish - young waitress Marina really wanted to be anywhere other than serving you an",
          "What a view drinks in the moonlight. A nice little find after a walk around the streets of dubrovnik.",
          "Little hard to find spot. It is worth exploring to find it. We were wandering one afternoon and came across it. Go to this place for the view. Pretty amazing. Did not have a drink so I cannot comment on the prices. I will say the manager went out of her way that day to",
          "I can't understand people from UK complaining about price of drinks in Buza. No more expensive than a town centre bar in most UK cities. View is spectacular, chilled out music...busy but what do you expect from a wonderful location like this. A must visit when in",
          "Really cool place by the rocks and ocean facing the view of Lokrum island. Don't go on a windy evening since theres no blankets and its freezing.",
          "We came by this place by chance as we followed the prospect of cold drinks directed on the wall in the scorching summer sun. It basically was a hole in the wall on first look but the views are breath taking as soon as you pass through the city walls. It was jam packed when we",
          "There are 2 Buza bars but both of them similar. They both have a great view and you can sit down and watch the Adriatic sea. They are expensive, their offer is very limited and it is hard to find a table in a sunny hot day.",
          "This place our favourite evening spot for my girlfriend and I, and we went there on three consecutive evenings. Buza clings to the cliffside, and seems almost at risk of tumbling into the sea! The panorama is astounding; dominated by the yawning water, we were able to watch the",
          "We didn't know about this bar before we did the wall walk. We noticed people siting out on the cliff edge from the wall and we had to be there and have a drink. It's not an easy place to find but once there you just want to be there all day. They only serve drinks but once you",
          "What a stunning view, chilled by a pleasant sea breeze and listening to the waves breaking, a perfect place to recharge and have drinks before/after dinner",
          "The drinks are pricey but your paying for the views and experience. Beautiful views across to Lokrum and all of the boats, ships and kayaks in the harbour. Heard it's quite hard to find but we stumbled across it while exploring the city. Very cool bar.",
          "This hidden bar is accessed through a small doorway at the south of the walled city of Dubrovnik. Surprisingly good selection of reasonably priced drinks, and there's even table service which is a plus, considering the many levels of the bar area (spread out across the cliff).",
          "Great little cafe on the edge of the cliff just outside the walls. Staff are really friendly and the view is untainted and gorgeous of the Adriatic and Lokrum.",
          "My first night in Dubrovnik I had to find this place. I've seen it on TripAdvisor and it looked great. Let me tell you, words cannot describe how cool this bar is. It's basically right on a cliff and overlooks the water. If you get there too late in the day your drink",
          "This place hasn't got the biggest range of drinks and no snack options however it does have the most amazing view and a nice and relaxing atmosphere. You can easily spend a couple of hours enjoying the sunshine, admiring the Adriatic. The staff were very friendly and were very",
          "Out of everything in Dubrovnik this was not worth seeing or sitting in for drinks. there are many other beautiful place in the city worth going to. the price for beer is way to high and they know tourist will pay it.",
          "This bar is hidden away through the City walls. If you're lucky enough to find it you can sit on the cliffs and watch the locals jump in to the sea off the cliffs. The views are stunning. The drinks are a little expensive but it's worth it for the view and the experience. Only",
          "I stayed in Dubrovnik five nights and visited this place twice. The view is everything. The beer is good, and expectedly a little pricey considering the view, but I very much enjoyed it. Definitely come by here at least once if you're visiting Dubrovnik."

        "wiki": "The Walls of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Dubrova\u010dke gradske zidine) are a series of defensive stone walls surrounding the city of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia. With numerous additions and modifications throughout their history, they have been considered to be amongst the great fortification systems of the Middle Ages, as they were never breached by a hostile army during this time period. In 1979, the old city of Dubrovnik, which includes a substantial portion of the old walls of Dubrovnik, joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.The oldest systems of fortifications around the town were likely wooden palisades. Today's intact city walls, constructed mainly during the 12th\u201317th centuries, mostly a double line, have long been a source of pride for Dubrovnik. The walls run an uninterrupted course of approximately 1,940 metres (6,360 ft) in length, encircling most of the old city, and reach a maximum height of about 25 metres (82 ft). The bulk of the existing walls and fortifications were constructed during the 14th and 15th centuries, but were continually extended and strengthened up until the 17th century.This complex structure, amongst the largest and most complete in Europe, protected the freedom and safety of a \"civilised\" and \"sophisticated\" republic that flourished in peace and prosperity for some five centuries. The walls were reinforced by three circular and 14 quadrangular towers, five bastions (bulwarks), two angular fortifications and the large St. John's Fortress. Land walls were additionally reinforced by one larger bastion  and nine smaller semicircular ones, like the casemate Fort Bokar, the oldest preserved fort of that kind in Europe. The moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls, which were armed by more than 120 cannons, provided superb city defense capabilities.\n\n\n== Former city walls ==\nThe construction of the first limestone forts around the city began in the Early Middle Ages, towards the end of the 8th century. But, the \"old chronicles\" say that some sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that. It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls, probably mainly by wooden palisades. The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long invasion by the Saracens in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified.The city first spread towards the uninhabited eastern part of the islet, which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city, near St. John's Fortress, is called Pustijerna. The name \"Pustijerna\" comes from the Latin statement \"post terra\", which means \"outside the town\". In the 9th and 10th centuries, the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city. When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in the 11th century, the city merged with the settlement on land, and soon, a single wall was built around the area of the present-day city core.During this same time period, Dubrovnik and the surrounding area were described as a part of the Croatian (Grwasiah) entity, in one of the works by the famous Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi. In his book Nuzhat al-Mushataq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq (English: \"Joy for those who wish to sail over the world\") from 1154, he mentioned Dubrovnik as the southernmost city of \"the country of Croatia and Dalmatia\". The basic city plan dates from 1292, when the port was rebuilt following a fire. The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century, except for the Dominican monastery, which came under its protection later on, during the 14th century.\n\n\n== Modern-day city walls ==\n\nThe city walls have been preserved to the present day, not only because of the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.\n\nThe present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from Venetian suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally unaffected by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667.\nThe largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Ragusan fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by Turkish military forces, especially after they conquered Constantinople in 1453.\nThe city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians. For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city-republic by skillful maneuvering between East and West. A strategic treaty with Turkey protected Ragusa's liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe.The irregular parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik consists of four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Min\u010deta Tower, and to the east side of the city port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, freestanding, St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as Lovrijenac), protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city.\n\n\n=== Land Walls ===\nThe main wall on the landside is 4 metres (13 ft) to 6 metres (20 ft) thick, and, at certain locations, the walls reach up to 25 meters (80 feet) in height.\nThe land walls stretch from Fort Bokar in the west to the detached Revelin Fortress in the east. On the landside, the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire, especially against possible Ottoman attacks.\n\n\n==== Gates ====\nThe town has four city gates: two that lead to the harbor and two (with drawbridges) that lead to the mainland. During the time period when the Austrian Empire controlled the city, two more gates were opened in the wall.Communication with the outside world on the land side was maintained with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side of the city and the other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.\n\n\n===== Gate of Pile =====\nThe Pile Gates are a well-fortified complex with multiple doors, defended by Fort Bokar and the moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls. At the entrance gate to the Old Town, on the western side of the land walls, there is a stone bridge between two Gothic arches, which were designed by the esteemed architect Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107 in 1471. That bridge connects to another bridge, a wooden drawbridge which can be pulled up. During the republican era, the wooden drawbridge to the Pile Gate was hoisted each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city's keys to the Ragusan rector. Today, it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds. Above the bridges, over the arch of town's principal gateway, there is a statue of city patron Saint Blaise (Croatian: Sveti Vlaho), with a model of the Renaissance city. After passing the Pile Gate's original Gothic inner gateway, it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls.\n\n\n===== Gate of Plo\u010de =====\nOn the eastern side of the land walls stands the second major entrance to the city, the Gate of Plo\u010de. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Plo\u010de was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107. Mili\u010devi\u0107 was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.\n\n\n===== Gate of Bu\u017ea =====\nThe Gate of Bu\u017ea (meaning \"hole\") is located on the northern side of the land walls. This gate is relatively new compared to the other gates, as it was constructed during the early 1900s.\n\n\n=== Sea Walls ===\nThe main wall on the sea-facing side of Dubrovnik stretches from Fort Bokar in the west to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5\u201316 feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance. The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.\n\n\n==== City Harbour ====\nOne of the oldest sectors of Dubrovnik was constructed around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today. It was constructed on the site of the Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107 in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Bo\u017eidarevi\u0107 around 1500.The most prominent portion of the harbour is the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large arsenal built in the late 12th century and enlarged in the latter part 15th century. The harbour is also the oldest shipyard within the city and is still in use today.Porporela was built in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty (Ka\u0161e Breakwater) was built in 1485, according to the design of Paskoje Mili\u010devi\u0107, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves. The breakwater thus shortened the harbour's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder.Today, the arsenal hosts the City Caf\u00e9 and a movie theatre, whereas both the harbour and Porporela have become pleasant promenades and tourist attractions.\n\n\n==== Gates ====\nIn the city port area, one of the most significant areas of the maritime trade city, there were two entrances: the Gate of Ponte (port) and the Fishmarket Gate. The entire layout of the Dubrovnik streets, as well as a range of expansions, was intended for fast and effective communication with the forts of the city walls.\n\n\n===== Gate of Ponte =====\nConstructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is situated westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, built at the same period, leads from the Gate to St. John Fortress. The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century when the sewage system was completed, and building houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed.\n\n\n===== The Fishmarket Gate =====\nThe Fishmarket Gate, built in 1381, stands eastward from the Great Arsenal. The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where small boats were repaired, are situated a bit further. The old tower of St. Luke's protects the harbour in the east, and the harbour entrance is encircled and guarded by the Revelin Fortress.\n\n\n== Forts ==\n\n\n=== Forts within walls ===\nThe fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans was a clear sign to the cautious citizens of Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues. The fall of Bosnia, which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited the architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence to direct the improvement of the city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance for the defense of Dubrovnik.\n\n\n==== Min\u010deta Tower ====\nThe Min\u010deta Tower was built by a local builder named Nicifor Ranjina and Italian engineers sent by Pope Pius II in 1463, at the height of the Turkish threat. Originally as a strong four-sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the Men\u010deti\u0107 family, who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls. In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, Michelozzo built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low scarp walls. The full six-meter (20 feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Min\u010deta tower. He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the battlements are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.After a long excavation, a 16th-century cannon foundry was discovered under Min\u010deta Tower in Gornji ugao (Upper Tower). It is now a museum.Since Min\u010deta Tower is the highest point of the wall, it is considered to offer a seemingly \"unforgettable\" view on the city.\n\n\n==== Fort Bokar ====\nThe Fort Bokar, often called \"Zvjezdan\", is considered to be amongst the most beautiful instances of harmonious and functional fortification architecture. Built as a two-story casemate fortress by Michelozzo from 1461 to 1463, while the city walls were being reconstructed, it stands in front of the medieval wall face protruding into space almost with its whole cylindrical volume. It was conceived as the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate, the western fortified entrance of the city; and after the Min\u010deta Tower, it is the second key point in the defense of the western land approach to the city.\n\n\n==== St. John Fortress ====\nThe St. John Fortress (Croatian: Sveti Ivan), often called Mulo Tower, is a complex monumental building on the southeastern side of the old city port, controlling and protecting its entrance. The first fort was built in the mid 14th century, but it was modified on several occasions in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, which can be seen in the triptych made by the painter Nikola Bo\u017eidarevi\u0107 in the Dominican monastery. The painting shows Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik. Dominant in the port ambiance, the St. John Fortress prevented access of pirates and other enemy ships. Always cautious at the first sign of danger, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with heavy chains stretched between the St. John Fortress and the Kase jetty, and they also used to wall up all the port entries to the Great Arsenal.Today, the fortress houses an aquarium on the ground floor, stocked with fish from various parts of the Adriatic Sea. On the upper floors there is an ethnographic and a maritime museum devoted to the Republic Maritime Period, the Age of Steam, the Second World War, and the section of techniques of sailing and navigation.\n\n\n=== Detached forts ===\n\n\n==== Revelin Fortress ====\nIn the period of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a detached fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Plo\u010de Gate was built to the east of the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses in the service of the Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.The new Revelin became the strongest of the city fortresses, safeguarding the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped in the form of an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Plo\u010de Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic.\n\n\n==== St. Lawrence Fortress ====\n\nSt. Lawrence Fortress (Croatian: Lovrijenac), often called Dubrovnik's Gibraltar, is located outside the western city walls, 37 metres (121 ft) above sea level. The fortress has a quadrilateral court with mighty arches and, as its height is uneven, it has 3 terraces with powerful parapets with the broadest one looking south towards the sea. Lovrijenac was defended with 10 large cannons, the largest and most famous of which was called \"Lizard\" (Croatian: Gu\u0161ter). The walls exposed to enemy fire are almost 12 meters (39 feet) thick, but the large wall surface facing the city does not exceed 60 centimetres (2 feet). Two drawbridges lead to the fort, there being the inscription \"Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro\" \u2013 \"Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world.\" above the gate. To ensure loyalty, the troops in St. Lawrence Fortress were rotated every 30 days. And to ensure complete loyalty, they were given only 30 days of rations when they went into the fort. According to old scripts it was built in only three months.Today its interior is one of the most dignified stages in Europe, and a well-known place for William Shakespeare's Hamlet performances.\n\n\n== Fortifications around Dubrovnik ==\n\n\n=== Walls of Ston ===\n\nThe Walls of Ston are originally a series of defensive stone walls of more than 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) long. Despite its small size, the well protected Republic of Ragusa decided to use Pelje\u0161ac to build another line of defense. At Pelje\u0161ac's narrowest point, just before joining the mainland, a wall from Ston to Mali Ston was built.\nToday's 5.5-kilometre (3.4 mi) long wall that links these two small communities has the shape of a pentagon. It was completed in the 15th century along with other 40 towers and 5 fortresses. The \"wall\" meant protection to the precious salt pans that greatly contributed to Dubrovnik's wealth, which are still being worked today.\n\n\n=== Falcon Fortress ===\n\nThe Falcon Fortress (Croatian: Sokol Grad) was one of the largest and most important fortresses on the territory of the Republic of Ragusa, due to its position in the mountainous region near the Bosnian inland. It was built at the location of earlier Illyrian and later Roman fortifications, evident from the remains of ceramics and Roman bricks in its walls. In 1391, the Sankovi\u0107 brothers, at that time the rulers of Konavle, gave to the Republic of Rag full authority over the Falcon Fortress, while it came under republic's final possession only in 1423.Due to its strategic importance, the Republic of Ragusa constantly invested in the maintenance of the fortress, which contained a cistern, a powder storage, wine and food cellars, sentry-boxes, military barracks, and sanctuary buildings to accommodate refugees from nearby villages in the event of war.\n\n\n=== Imperial Fortress ===\n\nThe Fortress is placed at the top of the mountain Sr\u0111, just above the city of Dubrovnik. It was built in 1806 by Marshal Marmont, called the Imperial, in honor of emperor Napoleon. The fortress was strategically important to defend the northern side of the city.\n\n\n=== Prevlaka Fortress ===\n\nThis fortress is placed at Ponta O\u0161tro, at the very end of Prevlaka peninsula. It was built in the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor at the time of the Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time. Today, the fortress is out of use and badly damaged by various destructions during history.\n\n\n== City walls during sieges ==\n\n\n=== Saracen siege in 866\u2013867 ===\n\nIn 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, and then laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending over one hundred ships. Finally, the 866\u2013867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the intervention of Basil I, who sent a fleet under the command of Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.\n\n\n=== Venetian siege in 948 ===\n\nWith the weakening of Byzantium, Venice began to see Ragusa as a rival who needed to be brought under her control, but the attempt to conquer the city in 948 failed. The citizens of the city attributed this to Saint Blaise, whom they adopted as the patron saint of the city.\n\n\n=== Nemanja's siege in 1185 ===\n\nAfter some territorial disputes, war broke out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Ra\u0161ka, and the city of Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly.\n\n\n=== Venetian and Fourth Crusades siege in 1205 ===\n\nIn 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia with the forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, eventually becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.\n\n\n=== Siege by Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da in 1451 ===\n\nIn 1451, the very powerful Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.\n\n\n=== Russian siege in 1806 ===\n\nBy 1800, the Republic had a highly organized network of consulates and consular offices in more than eighty cities and ports around the world. In 1806, the Republic surrendered to the forces of the First French Empire to end a months-long siege by the Russian and Montenegrin fleet during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city. The French lifted the siege and Ragusa was saved. The French army, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, entered Dubrovnik in 1806. In 1808, Marshal Auguste de Marmont abolished the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamated its territory into the French Illyrian Provinces, himself becoming the \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse).\n\n\n=== Anglo-Austrian siege in 1814 ===\n\nAustria declared war on France in August 1813 and by the Autumn the Royal Navy enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea. Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy Rear Admiral Thomas Fremantle's ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another, forcing the surrender of the strategic ports one after another December. Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns) along with HMS Saracen an 18 gun brig, arrived at Ragusa already blockaded by Pro Austrian Croat forces led by Todor Milutinovi\u0107. The British with the Austrians were able to take the Imperial fortress and positions on Lokrum island. By hauling cannon up to Sr\u0111 hill they bombarded the city until the French General Joseph de Montrichard decided it was best to surrender. British and Croat troops entered the city via the Pile gates shutting the Ragusan rebels out.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav army siege in 1991\u20131992 ===\n\nThe Siege of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Opsada Dubrovnika) is a term marking the battle and siege of the city of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area in Croatia as part of the Croatian War of Independence. Dubrovnik was besieged and attacked by forces of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in late 1991, with the major fighting ending in early 1992, and the Croatian counterattack finally lifting the siege and liberating the area in mid-1992. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the prosecution alleged that, \"It was the objective of the Serb forces to detach this area from Croatia and to annex it to Montenegro.\"In 1991, the American Institute of Architects condemned the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, in conjunction with UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) had been hit by projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It is a testament to the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFort Lovrijenac\nList of walls\nList of cities with defensive walls\nList of castles in Croatia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Main sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOld City of Dubrovnik \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre\nVideo, Dubrovnik Digital reconstruction by GRAIL at Washington University\n(in Croatian) Dru\u0161tvo prijatelja dubrova\u010dke starine \u2013 Gradske zidine",

          "I wouldn\u2019t recommend this aquarium The aquarium is placed in a beautiful old building and on a hot day, walking around with 3 children can be tiring. We found the fish beautiful but they all looked the same and were in very poor shelters. I was very sad to see a lonely turtle",
          "We were caught up in Dubrovnik in a huge downpour of rain so decided to take shelter in the aquarium. That was a huge mistake we walked in to find a lonely turtle in a tiny enclosure with nothing inside it eg. Coral, sand or anything fun for the turtle. It was disgusting to see",
          "Going to get straight to the point and say this place is straight up appalling. To start there\u2019s dead starfish/fish and other creatures in the tanks (see pictures) and the turtle is kept in a horribly dirty \u201cpool\u201d with no company and no more than 4/5 rocks to keep it",

          "Unless you really need to get out of the sun for half hour save your cash for something else. It\u2019s very small and so are the tanks and enclosures for the marine life. Felt especially sad for a lonely sea turtle in a small enclosure which was empty of anything remotely",

          "No more than a glorified fish tank. Very over priced at 60 kuna per person. There are only around 10 exhibits most of which are very small. Takes less than 10 minutes to walk around it. Do not waste your time going here as you will be very disappointed",
          "We visited the aquarium as it was bad weather and had already visited the museums. It was nice enough to have a wander round but not a huge amount to see here. It was reasonable enough at 60kuna each but not something that we'd rate as a must-see attraction.",
          "We found the aquarium after getting lost in side streets and regret it from the moment we paid. All the animals are in small, dark tanks with no enrichment or plants. There was a turtle who looked so depressed and was in a tank on his own. A sign on his tank assured us that his",

          "I left this aquarium almost in tears. The level of animal cruelty in this place is disgusting. There is a sea turtle kept in a pool with 5 rocks, the poor thing looked like its given up, no stimulation no company. Same with the octopus kept in a tiny tank with nothing but some",

          "It has a high price for the offering, the aquariums are small and empty of items other than the sea animals. They were mostly either overcrowded or super lonely without activities. Small and dull aquariums.",
          "Awful, awful place - and I don't say that to be dramatic. The fish are overcrowded in dull aquariums, the octopus looks depressed and the turtle enclosure boarders on animal cruelty. Please, do not go here.",

          "Went here randomly, as quite like aquariums generally. What a bad choice! Entry fee was 80KN each. Thought not too bad price considering the rest of the attractions for the town. You expect something much bigger! It is in a historical cool building, you feel like in a cave,",

          "We found this place on trip advisor and despite the reviews we were intent on visiting. I'm glad we did - it's not huge bit it's amazing. It's not a man made building with regular fish like sea life centres. The aquarium used to be an ammunition store during the war so well",
          "60kn entry fee. Brilliant little aquarium located close to the harbour area. Walk around takes about 30/45 mins and has lots of fish and sea creatures to see. The exhibits seemed to be quite different from usual sea life centres. Would recommend a visit.",

          "Despite being at the peak of the tourist season we were the only visitors. Sad because the location is great, sad because the building could contribute to the experience and sad because the exhibits seem unloved. Family of 4 cost 200 kuna and we left more depressed than",

          "Unfortunately the internet in my hotel wasn't great otherwise I would have been able to check this place out and probably given it a miss. You pay 60 Kuna for an adult (currently just short of \u00a37) and I had hoped to while away half an hour or so however the aquarium is tiny,",
          "The only good thing about this attraction is that it is built into the city walls, which did make it feel atmospheric. What it also did was make it very dark, you can hardly see anything. Not that there's much to see in the first place. It only took us about 15 minutes to go",
          "If you are an aquarist you will probably be disappointed. As someone who works with fish for a living this didn't exactly \"blow me away\" but my young daughter absolutely loved it and threw tantrums upon leaving. If you need something to entertain the kids for about 45mins this",
          "It's quite small, especially when the admission price considered. The best part of any aquarium is the tunnel you walk through, there's none to be found here. The tanks are very small, I felt bad for the Loggerhead Turtle who isn't fully grown yet but is swimming up and down in",
          "there's a lot of bad reviews here for the aquarium but we loved it. I visited end of May with my 2 girls 3 and 7. Its small and will only take 30 mins to get around but its worth it. We saw turtles, sea horses and ray amongst others, the location is beautiful set in an old 13th",
          "The Dubrovnik Sea Aquarium is set in a vaulted chamber in the base of St John's Fortress. It is also part of a marine research centre. Inside were numerous tanks featuring fish from the Adriatic. Amongst the species on display there was a large loggerhead turtle, a flying squid,",
          "By and large it's a nice little aquarium. I understand they are building a newer larger one near the main port. The collection seems to be rather smallish tanks, despite a sufficiently large vaulted chamber for a larger tank that would allow more interaction vertically as well",
          "I go to every aquarium I can when I travel. This is no Monterey Bay, or Okinawa Churaumi. But it's still pretty cool and unique in it's way. I was as mesmerized by their moray eels as I have been by just about anything elsewhere - they are both so beautiful and revolting at",

          "Great selection of local species, which is a welcome change from the usual variety of colourful species from around the world, and an amazing setting inside a fort!",
          "The place smelt awful and I expect animals were not well looked after. The tanks were all small but we mainly felt sorry for the turtle kept in a small and dirty concrete pool with nothing for it see. It's a beautiful creature but visitors can't see it and it can't see anything.",
          "I have seen many aquariums in Europe and this was worse the one in Dubrovnik. And not only simple, but also very expensive entrance fee. I would not recommend to anyone.",
          "Anyone with experience visiting other sea aquarium like this will find nothing exotic aka boring. There were very little variety of sea lives, very very very small in size & above all it is so expensive. Nevertheless, I find the aquarium in the old brick walls kind a unique. But",
          "There is very little here to win you over. Janet liked the conga eels and I liked the turtle, and we both liked the octopus, but we left feeling very sorry for the crowded conditions and the small number of exhibits.",

          "Good way to spend 30 minutes if hanging around. Don't be expecting much, plenty of fish and a big turtle at the entrance but lacks the wow factor of other aquariums I have been too.",
          "This aquarium is located at the harbor and it is easy to find. It has a lot of \"local\" mediteranean fish and other sea inhabitants. Definitely a must see in the rainy day in Dubrovnik! Would recommend if you need a \"cool off\" or in rainy days as said!",
          "It's OK to kill about half an hour. Very dark inside and never very busy. One of the smaller aquariums I've visited. A mix of open pools and tanks",
          "Hands down this is the worst aquarium I have ever visited. Took us just over 5 minutes to see the whole \"attraction\". Just read a few reviews saying they spent an hour there... I find that very very hard to believe. The species there weren't the most interesting... would find",
          "This was a disappointing aquarium for a town that is so close to the sea. The highlight is the turtle at the entrance. The rest of the exhibits contained dull fish or empty tanks. For example, we hoped to see an octopus but it wasn't there. Tanks are so small I find it difficult",
          "I wish I have something nice to say about this aquarium, but I can't. Set in the stunning site of the old town next to the sea you would imagine that it could be a real attraction. However, the reality was quite unsettling. Middle aged woman on the counter didn't seem to know",
          "We enjoyed this aquarium and spent the best part of an hour in here. The turtle was nice to watch, and so was the octopus. Lots of fish to see. Our 6 year old really enjoyed watching the fish and spent ages at her favourite tanks watching the fish in them. The signage is in",
          "Grumpy woman on reception not at all welcoming. One of our party was obviously unwell and was told \"you can't sit there\" complete lack of human empathy and no interest in encouraging paying customers to come to this museum. Point taken, we shall'nt go again.",
          "If you have never been to an aquarium before you may find this interesting, otherwise, compared to any other aquarium this would have to rate as the worst. The location is stunning, built into the city walls. I saw nothing of a 'maritime museum' so my comment relate only to the",

          "Yes the building is beautiful but the fish are crammed in tiny tanks . The sea turtle was in a talk about the width of a single bed that wasn't clean or had any stimulation. The Ray as mentioned before had its barb removed. All the fish swam in circles and there was a dead fish",
          "The aquarium is small, dark, thoroughly miserable and can be walked around in 5minutes. The marine life live in small tanks, some of which seem over crowded and the fish look thoroughly fed up in the cramped and limited conditions. The star of the aquarium is a majestic turtle",
          "We just visited the aquarium which is set in a very nice historic building. The aquarim itself is small and I think that the price of 60 kn per person for such a small aquarium is too much (that's the main reason for the average rating).",
          "This was the most depressing part of my holiday. The tanks were dark, small and very over crowded! Large fish were crammed into small tanks unable to have a good swim. A poor turtle on its own sat depressed in an extremely small dark tank which actually really upset me! This",
          "The aquarium is atmospheric - set inside the deep walls of the city walls - but it is low key and nothing unusual. The Naval Museum is a real treat. Spread over two large floors the exhibition gives the best history of the role of this sea-faring City state within the region.",
          "Even if you are not a huge fan of maritime artefacts it is worth having a look in this museum. It is located in St John's fortress in the south east corner of the old town. It is a brilliant exhibition space and a good place to escape oppressive summer heat. Entry is 35kn or",
          "An oasis of cool in a hot city. My 3 year old loves aquariums so it was a hit with us. Not very big but had good displays including open pools. Had to lift my boy up to look at most of the displays, some at floor level would be good!",

          "The museum and the aquarium have nothing to do with each other so this should be two attractions. We did not go to the museum but I kinda felt it was my duty as someone who actually looks after their pet fish to report quite how grim this \"aquarium\" was. The place was small",
          "In my travel book, the Maritime Museum was recommended but I'm really not sure why. It's exhibits are badly displayed and really not that interesting. Unless you're into pictures of container ships that is! The aquarium is alright, but nothing to write home about just a place to",
          "Really just a few tanks situated under the city walls. A little dark inside and the exhibits were not exactly breathtaking. This is ok to kill half and hour if you want to get out of the sun but if you have ever visited a Sealife Centre or similar it will disappoint you",

          "I have been to huge aquariums, and was not much eager to come in, but my companion have not. No amazement if you plan to pass it quickly. However all 25 aquariums might be a fantastic time-pass, if you are curious enough to spend some 5 mins at each and check what is going on",
          "Nice location but very little to see. Only a handfull of different aquariums with ordinary sealife inside. Hard to call this place as an aquarium. You can spend only 15 min inside after it gets boring. Do not plan to stay longer.",
          "I only went to the aquarium and it really wasn't worth it. It is very small, with only a few aquariums and the animals are put in very small boxes. I was bored after a few minutes already, I don't recommend it.",

        "wiki": "Tourism is a major industry in Croatia. In 2018, Croatia had 19.7 million tourist visitors who made 110.275 million overnight stays. The history of tourism in Croatia dates back to the middle of the 19th century in the period around 1850. It has been developing successfully ever since. Today, Croatia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\nTourism in Croatia is concentrated in the areas along the Adriatic coast and is strongly seasonal, peaking in July and August.Eight areas in the country have been designated national parks, and the landscape in these areas is afforded extra protection from development. Currently, there are ten sites in Croatia inscribed on the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites and 15 sites on the tentative list.\nLonely Planet named Croatia as the top pick destination for 2005, while National Geographic Adventure Magazine named Croatia as Destination of the Year in 2006.\n\n\n== General ==\nCroatia has a rich historical and cultural heritage, and natural beauty. Its greatest advantage in terms of tourism is its Adriatic Sea coast which, according to the 2010 European Environment Agency's survey, had the second cleanest water in all of Europe. A mild Mediterranean climate with a warm summer and moderately cold winter favor tourism. The tourist offer of Croatia is very diverse and consists of nautical, excursion, diving, congress, cultural, ecological, rural, religious, adventure, hunting or fishing and health tourism.\nIn 2014, Croatia had 851 registered tourist facilities, of which 605 hotels, 84 campsites, 52 tourist apartments, 41 tourist settlements, 19 apart-hotels and 50 marinas. In all these facilities, there were more than 100,000 accommodation units and about 237,000 permanent beds. In 605 hotels, there were 53,217 accommodation units and 102,430 beds. Out of 605 hotels, 301 had three stars, 192 four, and 29 five stars. Adriatic.hr is a leading tourist agency providing online booking services on the Adriatic since 2000, they have over 13500 apartments and 500 hotels on offer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first tourist object in Croatia, considered the first Croatian hotel, is Villa Angiolina that was built in Opatija in 1844. In 1868 on the island of Hvar, a hygienic society was founded, and this year is considered to be the year of the beginning of organized tourism on the island. Hotel Kvarner was opened in Opatija in 1884, Hotel Therapia in 1894 in Crikvenica, and Hotel Imperial in 1896 in Dubrovnik. As early as 1914, Opatija recorded over half a million overnight stays, and tourists spent 20 days on average in the city.\nSocial benefits of tourism have gradually begun to be recognized so the legislation in tourism and catering was introduced. The hotel capacities of the time between the two world wars were mainly owned by foreigners, and 80% of foreign traffic was made by tourists from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.\nIn 1926, over one million overnight stays were recorded for the first time, and in 1929 there were more foreign guests visiting Croatia than local tourists (52% vs 48%). The Decree on the Improvement of Tourism and the Decree on Conditions for the Proclamation of Tourist Areas were enacted in 1936. The record tourist season in this period was in 1938 when 399,608 visitors made 2,719,939 overnight stays.\nSignificant development of tourism in Croatia began in 1952, but although the overall number of tourist was growing, Croatia lagged behind its competition in terms of profit, and the quality of services decreased. After WWII, Croatia was a federal constitute of SFR Yugoslavia so the overall tourist offer was rated as unfavorable according to the \"value for money\" criteria. Educated people were leaving the country for better-paid jobs overseas, and under such conditions, small private renters developed, and the Croatian coast become a destination for mass tourism, which was particularly evident in the 1980s. The expansion of tourism capacity building lasted until 1975, at a growth rate of 11.4% for basic capacities and 9.7% for complementary capacities. In that period, 69% of the basic and 72% of complementary capacities that were offered by Croatia on the tourism market in 1990 were built. 68.2 million overnight stays were recorded in 1986, while in 1987 there were 10,5 million visitors, representing the largest number of overnight stays and visitors up until Croatia's independence from SFR Yugoslavia in 1990. In that period, Croatia accounted for about 75% of foreign tourist revenues of Yugoslavia.\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence (1991\u20131995), tourism stagnated in Istria, while in much of Dalmatia and the areas affected by the war drastically fell. Between 1990 and 1995, the number of tourist arrivals was lower by as much as 69.3 percent, while the number of overnight stays fell by 75 percent, so the numbers were close to those recorded in the 1960s.\nAfter the war, tourism began to recover and in 1996 there was a slight increase in relation to the 1994 season. Gradually, foreign tourists returned. With the return of tourists, the interest of foreign investors in Croatia was growing steadily, with the introduction of foreign capital increasing the role of destination management and marketing efforts to promote Croatia as a whole and unique destination. The increase in tourist arrivals and overnight stays also generated large revenue which increased their share in the country's GDP, so that it rose from 7.2 percent in 1995 to 17 percent in 2002.\nSince 2000, a number of tourist overnight stays has been rising continuously (downfall was recorded only in 2008 due to the global financial crisis). The record tourist season with the best results in Croatia's history was recorded in 2017 when Croatia was visited by 17,400,000 tourists who had 86,200,000 overnight stays. That same year Croatia's tourism revenues amounted \u20ac9.5 billion. In 2013, Croatia joined the European Union. Since 2012, the year before Croatia joined the EU, the number of annual tourist arrivals increased by nearly 6 million. Economists argue that Croatia's joining the EU made them a more desirable tourist location due to reinvestment in their economy, more open trade barriers, and lessened customs control.Tourism is fairly well-developed in Croatia but has room to develop further. Only 15% of the coast, the main tourist attraction in Croatia, is urbanized, and many plans are in progress to gradually develop Croatia's tourism sector even more. The Croatian Tourism Development Strategy has a goal to make Croatia a globally recognized tourist destination for all seasons, and is working towards that goal by making more luxury accommodations, including hotels and tourist services, or renovating older ones. Croatia also has one of the UNWTO's Sustainable Tourism Observatories, part of the organization's International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). The observatory is considered a commitment to monitoring and building sustainable tourism.\n\n\n== Tourism statistics ==\n\n\n=== Arrivals by country ===\nMost visitors arriving to Croatia on short term basis were from the following countries of nationality:\n\n\n== Tourist regions ==\nThe Croatian National Tourist Board has divided Croatia into six distinct tourist regions.\n\n\n=== Istria ===\n\nThe west coast of the peninsula of Istria has several historical towns dating from Roman times, such as the city of Umag, which hosts the yearly Croatia Open ATP tennis tournament on clay courts.The city of Pore\u010d is known for the UNESCO-protected Euphrasian Basilica, which includes 6th-century mosaics depicting Byzantine art. The city plan still shows the ancient Roman Castrum structure with main streets Decumanus and Cardo Maximus still preserved in their original forms. Marafor is a Roman square with two temples attached. One of them, erected in the 1st century, is dedicated to the Roman god Neptune. Originally a Gothic Franciscan church built in the 13th century, the 'Dieta Istriana' hall was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century.\nThe region's largest city Pula has one of the best preserved amphitheatres in the world, which is still used for festivals and events. It is surrounded by hotel complexes, resorts, camps, and sports facilities. Nearby is Brijuni national park, formerly the summer residence of late Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. Roman villas and temples still lie buried among farm fields and along the shoreline of surrounding fishing and farming villages. The coastal waters offer beaches, fishing, wreck dives to ancient Roman galleys and World War I warships, cliff diving, and sailing. Pula is the end point of the EuroVelo 9 cycle route that runs from Gda\u0144sk on the Baltic Sea through Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia.\n\nThe town of Rovinj contains well-indented coastal areas with a number of small bays hidden within dense vegetation, open to naturists. Although the beaches are not specified as naturist, naturists frequent them.The interior is green and wooded, with small stone towns on hills, such as Motovun. The river Mirna flows below the hill. On the other side of the river lies Motovun forest, an area of about 10 square kilometres in the valley of the river Mirna, of which 280 hectares (2.8 km2) is specially protected. This area differs not only from the nearby forests, but also from those of the entire surrounding karst region because of its wildlife, moist soil, and truffles (Tuber magnatum) that grow there. Since 1999, Motovun has hosted the international Motovun Film Festival for independent films from the U.S. and Europe. Groznjan, another hill town, hosts a three-week jazz festival every July.\n\n\n=== Kvarner and Highlands ===\n\nOne of the most varying regions, the entire Kvarner gulf provides striking scenery, with tall mountains overlooking large islands in the sea. Opatija is the oldest tourist resort in Croatia, its tradition of tourism ranging from the 19th century.The former Venetian island towns of Rab and Lo\u0161inj are popular tourist destinations. The island of Rab is rich in cultural heritage and cultural-historical monuments. Rab is also known as a pioneer of naturism after the visit of King Edward VIII and Mrs Wallis Simpson. The island offers nature, beaches, heritage, and events such as the Rab arbalest tournament and the Rab Medieval festival \u2013 Rapska Fjera. With around 2600 hours of sunshine a year, the island of Lo\u0161inj is a tourist destination for Slovenians, Italians, and Germans in the summer months.  Average air humidity is 70%, and the average summer temperature is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) and 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) during the winter.\n\nThe interior regions Gorski kotar, Velebit and Lika have mountain peaks, forests and fields, many animal species including bears, and the national parks of Risnjak and Plitvice Lakes. The Plitvice Lakes National Park lies in the Plitvice plateau which is surrounded by three mountains part of the Dinaric Alps: Plje\u0161evica mountain (Gornja Plje\u0161evica peak 1,640 m), Mala Kapela mountain (Seli\u0161ki Vrh peak at 1,280 m), and Medve\u0111ak (884 m). The national Park is underlain by karstic rock, mainly dolomite and limestone with associated lakes and caves, this has given rise to the most distinctive feature of its lakes. The lakes are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is deposited by the action of moss, algae, and bacteria. The encrusted plants and bacteria accumulate on top of each other, forming travertine barriers which grow at the rate of about 1 cm per year. The sixteen lakes are separated into an upper and lower cluster formed by runoff from the mountains, descending from an altitude of 636 to 503 m (2,087 to 1,650 ft) over a distance of some eight km, aligned in a south-north direction.\n\nThe lakes collectively cover an area of about two square kilometers, with the water exiting from the lowest lake to form the Korana River. The lakes are divided into the 12 Upper Lakes (Gornja jezera) and the four Lower Lakes (Donja jezera): Under the travertine waterfalls Cratoneuron moss sometimes grows, the moss gets encrusted with travertine and fresh moss grows further out, first a crag is formed but later a cave roof forms under the crag. If the water continues flowing the cave becomes progressively bigger. Limestone caves are present as well. The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species. Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species. At least 126 species of birds have been recorded there, of which 70 have been recorded as breeding.\n\n\n=== Dalmatia ===\n\n\n==== Zadar ====\n\nThis region caters to yachting and leisure travel.

        "wiki": "The Lazzarettos of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Dubrova\u010dki lazareti) is a group of interconnected buildings located 300 meters away from the walls of Dubrovnik that were once used as a quarantine station for the Republic of Ragusa.\n\n\n== History ==\nRepublic of Ragusa  was an active merchant city-state and was thus in a contact with people and goods from all over the world so it had to introduce preventive health measures to protect its citizens from various epidemics which broke out in countries across the Mediterranean and the Balkans due to poor hygiene. The time period between the 14th and 18th centuries was known as the most difficult time of plague and cholera epidemics in Europe and Asia. Old chroniclers wrote that the main cause of epidemics in the Middle East was \"the lack of any sense of hygiene\". Given that the preparations for the treatment of various infectious diseases recommended by the doctors at the time, such as vinegar, sulfur, and garlic, were ineffective, people came up with the idea of stopping epidemics from spreading by isolating the infected.\nOn July 27, 1377, the Great Council of the Republic adopted a decree which introduced a quarantine as a measure of protection against the spread of infectious diseases by which all merchants, sailors, and goods arriving from \"suspicious lands\" could not enter the city if they haven't spent a month in a quarantines which were on the remote, uninhabited islands of Mrkan, Bobara and Supetar. These quarantines were at first in the outdoors but since the weather conditions were almost as deadly as the diseases, the government decided to build few wooden dwellings (wooden so that it could be burned if needed). This decision was made after Dubrovnik was struck by an outbreak of the plague in 1348 which killed a few thousand citizens. This decree was published in Dubrovnik's book of laws, the so-called Green Book (Latin: Liber viridis); Veniens de locis pestiferis non intret Ragusium nel districtum (English: Whoever comes from the infected lands shall not enter Ragusa or its territory).In 1397, the Great Council adopted a new decree - De ordinibus contra eos qui veniunt de locis pestiferis anno 1397 factis (transl.\u2009On Decrees Adopted in 1397 Against Those Arriving From the Plague Infestated Lands)  which determined duration and the place of the quarantine, imposed penalties for the perpetrators and ordered the appointing of three healthcare officers called kacamorti to supervise the implementation and compliance with quarantine provisions. The penalties for not complying with the provisions of this decree were 100 ducats or prison sentence and severe corporal punishment. The penalty was applied only to commoners. In addition, a Decree prohibited the importation of goods from the countryside for the entire duration of the epidemic.In the 15th century, the quarantine facilities were moved closer to the city because the Ottoman Empire could have used them as a base for the attack on the city. By the mid-15th century, quarantines have become complex institutes that employed scribe, two guards, gravedigger, two cleaners, and additionally, since 1457 epidemic, priest, barber, and two kacamorti's. In 1430, some houses in the Gradac public park were used as quarantine facilities. In 1457, a lazaretto and a Catholic church were built by builder Miho\u010d Radi near Dan\u010da Beach. The good organization of this lazaretto allowed complete abandonment of quarantines on the islands near Cavtat. This quarantine facility had its own surgeon who replaced barber and two kacamorti's. In 1526, Dubrovnik was struck by the hardest outbreak of the plague which completely paralyzed the city (Government fled the city).Construction of a large lazaretto on Lokrum started in 1533, and was completed at the end of the 16th century. In 1590, the government started with the construction of the lazaretto in Plo\u010de. The constriction was completed in 1642. It contained 10 multistory buildings (5 for goods, 5 for people) connected by 5 interior courtyards. This lazaretto had five areas and five residential buildings for passengers who had to go through quarantine. From each side of the area where the houses for people were, there were the towers for the guards and the apartment for the Ottoman envoy who acted as a judge for Ottoman subjects who were visiting Dubrovnik.With the construction of the lazarettos, epidemics were significantly suppressed with last breaking out in 1815-16. After the fall of the Republic in 1808, lazarettos were used for quarantine of merchants coming to Dubrovnik from the inner-Balkans, and later for military purposes. Lazarettos were damaged by fire in the second half of the 19th century and again at the end of the First World War. Following the first renovation, the arcades in the courtyards and the gates facing the sea were bricked up.\nToday, the Lazarettos are used for recreation, trade, and entertainment. On July 7, 2017, Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds gave 33,8 million kunas to the City of Dubrovnik for the project \u2018Lazareti \u2013 kreativna \u010detvrt Dubrovnika\u2019 [Lazzarettos - Creative Neighborhood of Dubrovnik].\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nLazarettos were built in stages between 1590 and 1642. At first, three courtyards and a number of covered porches and dwellings for the ship crew members and caravan companions were built. Two additional courtyards and buildings were added later. Every courtyard had a door facing the seaside which was used to unload the goods from the ships. There were concealed porches with large arcades for goods storage on both sides of the yard. Arcades and courtyards form Lazarettos lower ground floor. A staircase leads from these groundfloor courtyards to the upper, large, shared courtyard in which small residential buildings, used for housing passengers who had to go through quarantine, were built. Tenants in these buildings were at the same time guardians of the goods stored in the arcades. Each building had one small window so the ship crew members could look after the stored goods. By the addition of the new part in 1633, Lazarettos had five courtyards with ten porches and ten residential buildings in the upper yard, nine of which were ground floor and one single story.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions.

          "The church is away from the main drag and is situated at the top of a lovely staircase. Inside it is just lovely and in great condition (it's around 300 years old). As it is a little bit away from Placa, it was not as packed as some of the other churches in Dubrovnik. Definitely",

          "This was my favourite church in Dubrovnik. The inside was magnificent, and it was also the least busy. Only problem that it is not easy to get to for anyone who struggles with steps, as there is a steep and large set of steps that you have to take to get here.",
          "This medieval church has some lovely frescoes and also houses the biggest bell in Dubrovnik. The elegant steps that lead up to it reminded me of the Spanish steps in Rome. Lovely monument.",
          "This is such an old yet beautiful church which reminds you of the Roman and Byzantine worlds. You can enjoy the peace and tranquility inside the church and admire the intricate design and paintings on the wall. The temperature was soaring outside but it was really cool inside,",
          "There are churches everywhere, most of them big, but many in the old city are not as well-maintained as this one. Compared to the dismal Cathedral, this one is smart and fairly beautiful. Something to do with Jesuits I think but by the time we got here I was reeling from all",
          "I think this was actually the most beautiful church I saw in Dubrovnik. You have to go a bit out of your way in the old city, but it is worth it; The church is more decorated than other churches in the city.",
          "Lucky to be able to join the English Sunday mass in this old and beautiful church. A bit hot because it was summer time, however worth to do.",
          "The architecture and design is amazing. A great place to meditate and get away from the crowds. One of the best maintained churches I have visited",
          "We made a point of finding this attraction, basically, i wanted to find the nod to the Spanish Steps....it was worth it.",
          "If you are there during high season and enjoy visiting churches go early in the morning, watch the sunrise hit the face of the church, then explore inside. Great when you are there by yourself.",
          "Most of the people marching around the city walls of Dubrovnik will probably miss this stunning fresco. Too bad. We loved it.",
          "Peaceful baroque church with some nice marble and frescos. Seemed less busy than some of the other sites and churches in dubrovnik and was a cool haven from the heat of the day. Advertises holy mass in English every sunday at 11am.",
          "St. Ignatius is a beautiful church located in the old town in Dubrovnik, entrance is free and it's well worth going to as it's not far from the Main Street in the old town.",
          "You can get too much exposure to churches in Croatia and become inured to their beauty. This certainly is a quiet and peaceful place with some beautiful art but so are many of the other numerous places of worship in this country.",
          "Quietly lovely, very ornate, unfortunately it was mass on so visit cut short, but good atmosphere and pretty building",
          "This church is stunning and offers such peace giving time for reflection and thanks, in a city buzzing with tourists.",
          "Nice church with beautiful interior. Nothing to suggest its beauty from the outside. Sound quality in the church not great but worth a visit.",
          "Located at the top of the historic steps, nothing exciting from the outside, but the inside painting around the altar is spectacular... One of the nicest I have witnessed in the town, and has to be seen",
          "Sorry, but been spoiled by churches and cathedrals. This is a lovely church but nothing spectacular.",
          "A very nicely decorated place of worship and a bit harder to find than other churches inside the old city walls. We went inside with a Rick Steves tour. Very nice break from the hot sun. Lovely decor, nicely kept. Medium sized place of worship. Worth a look.",
          "There are many fine churches in Dubrovnik each with an interesting history. This church is at the top of a flight of stairs and well worth visiting after you have made the effort to climb the stairs. You can then relax at the cafe in the square and absorb the outside of the",
          "My daughter and I found this beautiful church at the top of the stairs used during Cersei Lannister's Walk of Shame in Game of Thrones. Not being part of a tour, we really had the time to look around and admire this breathtaking church. We loved the Madonna's garden inside! I",

          "A monumental Baroque staircase leads to the Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola, which is for me the most representative Baroque complex in Dubrovnik. I was built and decorated by Italian architects. The fresoes inside the church are fantastic. A must see in Dubrovnik.",
          "This building is in the main square of the city and whilst its not a large place of worship, the frescoes and decoration take your breath away. A must place to visit",
          "We visited both in the evening and during the day. I was saddened during the day that the church is unlit and a bit dark so the amazing parts or not easy to enjoy. At night, they are lit up and the place becomes magical. While it is inappropriate to take pics during mass, you",
          "The Church of St Ignatius is a little off the beaten path, but not by much. It\u2019s worth the diversion to seek this place out. We visited this site as a side visit on a Game of Thrones tour. Located on the south side of the Gundulic Square you will see a grand Baroque staircase",
          "This church is a real blessing. Tall and imposing though it be, nevertheless it gives a sense of real worship, helped by some beautiful and remarkable pictures in tiny mosaics of the 'stations of the cross'. It was a good place to pray.",
          "Amazing how this church has been well preserved. The history behind its construction is fascinating. You'll want to see it from every angle.",
          "One of the rare few churches here that actually offers English service. Happened to be here on a Sunday so got to attend their mass (tourists are welcomed too). Unique experience.",
          "One of the finest examples of baroque architecture in Croatia. The steps leading to the square resemble the famous Spanish Steps in Rome. Strange grotto inside the church.",

          "Stunning, well kept and clean. Free to enter and family friendly. Less than 5 minutes walk from the main thoroughfare.",
          "Lovely church, well worth taking a look if you are in the Old Town. Open all day and into the evening.",
          "We took this in and i cant say its the best church i have been inside, i guess i have been spoilt by italian churchesm but i would still recommend visiting as all tastes are different",
          "Stunning as the architecture of Dubrovnik is, I was shocked at the rampant commercialism of the Old Town. You quickly realise that there are no local businesses and everywhere is a bar, cafe, souvenir shop or even a Star Wars merchandise outlet. No kidding. That's part of why I",
          "After ascending a flight of relatively steep stairs, one comes to a landing where the Baroque styled St. Ignatius Church is seated. It's belfry is said to house a bell casted in the 14th century, the oldest in Dubrovnik. It is nothing grand but worth taking a look.",
          "The Church of St. Ignatius is not one of the top attractions of Dubrovnik. Its interior is intricate, but relatively simple when compared to the more grand Italian churches. The steps going to the church are quite steep. So why would one bother to even visit the church. First,",
          "Happened to walk past this church on our way back from Bar Buza and the door was open at approx 19:45 on Saturday evening on our way for dinner. We just wanted to view the beautiful church inside but we're amazed to see a 10 piece all female choir singing the most beautiful and",
          "So impressive. The attention to detail is phenomenal. We walked through the streets of the old town and we came across a few gems like this. You may feel that it's sometimes disrespectful to take photos inside a church, but how can you resist when it looks like this. Stunning.",
          "Going from a busy touristic placa to a peace and calm vibe is very different, but pleasing. I am not religious but I can recommend you to atleast make a short visit.",
          "This church radiates calmness on its own. It's simple from the outside,but has a nice vibe. On summer evenings,musicians play at the entrance.",
          "You have to walk up a steep staircase to get to the church. Game of Thrones fans will recognise the stairs as the \"stairs of atonement\" or \"walk of shame\" in series 5 I believe? The church itself is located in a small square, it was very cool inside and peaceful. Not heavily",
          "It's easy to find the monumental Baroque Staircase that leads up to the Poljana Ru\u0111era Bo\u0161kovi\u0107a Square where the Church of St Ignatius and Dubrovnik's well-known Jesuit College, are located. This urban complex is considered by many to be the most representative Baroque example",
          "After touring the city walls, we headed over to see St. Ignatius Church. It's just past Gundulic Square, up the \"Walk of Atonement\" Stairs from Game of Thrones. The interior of the church was just beautiful. And unlike the rest of Dubrovnik that was incredibly crowded, it was",
          "An amazingly beautiful church. Incredible altars, art, architecture, Just humbling to think they built this with a pendulum and a lot of blood sweat and tears.",
          "From Gundulic Square with its wide Baroque staircase leading up to Boskovic Square, you see the beautiful Baroque Jesuit church, which was built at the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century...worth a visit.",
          "It's a smaller church some some of the biggies throughout Europe but it is very beautiful. The painted ceiling is the highlight but there are lots of alcoves that have been decorated very nice as well. It won't take long to see and it was very quiet and uncrowded when we went.",
          "Tucked away from the main thoroughfare of the city we came across this magnificent but simple church quite by accident. We noticed some pretty steps and wondered where they lead to. A lovely quiet piazza with a beautiful church set to the side of it. It was a Saturday evening",
          "Myself and husband visited this church. We had lost our way in this beautiful city and were on our way back to the Main gate. This church is at the top of another set of steps, I personally was drawn to this rather large building, not as elaborate as the other religious",
          "This is a lovely church with several altars inside.It has a wonderful mosaic on the wall of the main altar.There is a place at the back where you may light candles",
          "This is by far the most stunning church in all of Dubrovnik and certainly one of the most beautiful on the whole of the Dalmatian coast. The art work is breathtaking. However, it is the curved back wall of the main alter that simply draws you in. The concave wall adds this three",
          "This is a lovely old church in the old town. It is a peaceful place to sit or to pray if that is your wish. There is nothing too ornate or fancy about it. Outside their are curved stairs leading down to the street or a small narrow street in the opposite direction.",
          "The church is simpler than many Roman Catholic churches but lovely in its own way. The frescoes are a treat and the tourist traffic is not too heavy.",
          "In the hubbub of trying to jam in as many sights as possible, this church is a place of quiet reflection. A peaceful place of quiet in the middle of the old town, this church gives a traveler a place to sit and reflect. It is worth a little time to see this place.",
          "Beautiful church! Don't miss going in to see! Our guide, John, actually got married in this church and had much to say about it.",
          "A beautiful peaceful church in the middle of the old town. Definitely worth spending 10 mins to admire and experience this lovely church.",
          "Not my favourite church but then again I prefer older medieval ones with more history. However there are some nice paintings and the sculptures are very good. Its a nice place to relax and get away from the herds off the cruise ships.",
          "In middle of town! Actually we had our thoughts of climbing the long steps from Game of Thrones and eat lunch at top. Until we saw this church so close which was on to see list. What a pity to miss the artwork and feel of this historical church. We were lucky it was organ",
          "A quiet church that provides a moment for reflection as well as some nice iconography and wonderful views from outside.",
          "Last spring one of my best friends got married there! amazing place for such an event with family and friends! a must do in case of a wedding! and right in the middle of the old city!",
          "lovely Church and was lucky enough to attend the Sunday English Mass. Worth a visit inside to travellers.",
          "Right in the center of old town is this church. Point for game of throne the long steps you will recognize immediately",
          "What a beautiful church must be seen to admire this just from a brochure would be a great pity. Candles rather pricey though for two \u00a31.50- we pay 25 pence at my church at home",
          "Church of St. Ignatius is one of the most beautiful baroque churches in the region and beyond. A church care Jesuits . The church is the artificial cave dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes. If you manage to arrive at the right time you might be lucky to hear the organ playing that",
          "The church was designed by the Roman architect Andrea Pozzo and is based on the church of St Ignatius in Rome. Its construction began in 1699 and was completed in 1725. Its a very peaceful and beautiful church. For me, the highlight is the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, one of",
          "A lovely early 18th century Jesuit church and a place of peace and quiet away from the heat and the crowds outside. The frescoes depicting scenes from the life of St. Ignatius of Loyola are well worth seeing. The impressive (and steep) steps leading up to the Church featured in",
          "All the churches in Dubrovnik are reasonably small compared with their peers in other major European centres so don't get your expectations too high if you have toured some of the jewels in other capital cities. The architecture and stonework (in marble?) is eye catching and the",

          "This is a beautiful church that goes back to the 1700s. My wife and I celebrated mass in English here every Sunday at 11am. The father is very welcoming and there were around 40 parishioners attending this mass.",
          "My favourite chruch , there is a grotto of St Bernadette, such a beautiful place, not as ornate as some",
          "This is the church we liked the most in Dubrovnik. Quiet and much more impressive than St. Blaise. Well worth the climb.",
          "This is quite a small church but very peaceful with some wonderful murals. An excellent pause in your wandering around the old town. There is an English mass at 11am on Sundays...",
          "This is the only Church in the Dubrovnik area where Mass is spoken in English each day. Loverly decorated inside but a big walk up lots of steps buy worth it.",
          "Just getting to this place is sensational. It is situated in a hilltop within the ancient walled town and is well worth the visit.",
          "It is a stunning Church, with amazing frescos on the walls and roof, and the art and architecture is brilliant, I really enjoyed seeing this Church",
          "Stunning church in the middle of Dubrovnik old city. Beautiful & colourful paintings & sculptures. Worth popping in.",
          "If you divert away from the main tourist hub of the Square of the Loggia by only 200 metres and climb the so-called 'Spanish Steps' - which aren't as impressive as their name-sake in Rome, but are still quite imposing - you arrive at the baroque facade of this early 18th century",
          "This church is immediately above Gundulic's squad, up yet more steep steps. It has an abundance of Baroque features and is a restful place away from the main hurly burly of the city. There are several restaurants, for a pit stop, and some concession stalls adjacent to it in the",
          "If you can see every church you can it's unbelievable. THe art is crazy and open for all to view. Amazing artifacts saved everywhere you look",
          "It is a bit of a climb up some steps but well worth visiting this church. Inside some interesting paintings and it is very peaceful. A cool place to sit in quiet surroundings. The Lourdes grotto quite beautiful if you like looking at that sort of thing",
          "Visited while walking round the old town. It's truly worth a visit inside. Very beautiful. We walked round late afternoon to avoid the crowds and tour guides. Restaurant near by where you can have a coffee or something to eat. They have a toilet too.",
          "Stunning church, there is a bit of a climb up a fair few steps to get there but worth it once you had made it to the top! The church is very informative with sufficient information inside the church to find out a little more. It was wonderful to be there to see a wedding party",
          "The church is at the back end of old town. Beautifully painted and decorated. Have a look around this stunning church.",
          "Beautiful Jesuit church, open to public and with services in English. Very nice to visit and view the Jesuit influence in croatia",
          "Beautiful very big church situated at the top of the Old Town although access was up quite a lot of steps, but well worth the effort.",

          "visited this church twice,absolutelly stunning.there is a corner at the back dedicated to the soldiers that died in the war. so touching.",
          "The internal architecture of the the Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola is just amazing. Not something to be expected given the rather ordinary look from the outside though. Definitely worth a short visit if you travelling to the Old Town of Dubrovnik.",
          "Some of the best free artwork in Europe is found inside these old churches and Saint Ignatius will not disappoint.",
          "Had an Old Mate pretty crook back home so combined the viewing of some pretty impressive Churches all over the place with the lighting of a candle & prayer for him and others ! A good habit I thought ? The Church of St. Ig was pretty impressive, beautiful interior with a",

          "This church is part of a complex in the old town, which adds a Jesuit College , dating from the early 16th century. Shortly after the start of its construction happened the great earthquake of 1667 - which practically razed the entire city - it is a magnificent example of",
          "Small but lovely church with some lovely paintings, especially the dome over the alter. We were dining on the same square and saw a kitten and it's mother go in, so we only went in to follow them. We never saw them in there but instead were awed by the church itself.",
          "from the outside looks like a building site but once in the paintings and ceilings are really wonderful to look at Worth the 20 mins inside studying the walls and taking a rest from climbing the steps",

          "This is a beautiful church - kinda out of the way, up on a hill. The colors are fantastic. Worth a visit.",
          "We stumbled across this place by accident and are so glad we did. Its up a load of steps and doesnt look much from the outside but is a beautiful site once you step inside. It is a lovely peaceful setting with a spectacular alter. Beautiful!",
          "well worth a visit even if its jsut to escape some of the hustle and bustle of the city streets. Beautiful interiors",
          "We came across St Ignatius Church accidentally after walking up the Spanish steps. It's such a beautiful church with a really impressive altar. It's free to get in and it's located in quite a nice square.",
          "Dubrovnik churches and their art cannot match the glories of their Italian neighbours. This one comes closest. It's on a surprisingly grotty piazza in a quiet corner of Dubrovnik, at the top of a grand \"Spanish steps.\" The tall fa\u00e7ade leads to a truly glorious, soaring",
          "Enjoyed the church with fine proportions and a daze of pinks and blues around altar. The church was full of tourists - best to pick carefully in Dubrovnik when it comes to what is worth the time - this was better than most.",
          "If you enjoy architecture and old churches, this is worth your time. Although the city was crowded, this church was not and it was simply beautiful and peaceful to walk through.",
          "You'll have to climb the stairs to get to the Church of St. Ignatius, but it is well worth it. The interior is stunning, and each one of the side altars is a work of art on its own. Bring your camera as this church allows you to take photos as long as there isn't a Mass going",
          "We enjoyed spending some time here, away from the bustling crowd... inside it was pure silence! Everyone was awed by the impressive murals in this beautiful little church!",

          "Peaceful and beautiful. One of the few churches still in operation in the old town. The high gothic ceilings allow natural light in to highlight the painted walls. Large and plain from the outside and a lovely surprise when you walk in.",

          "One of the most beautiful churches I have been to....and there have been many. The attention to detail of the paintings and the architecture are a wonder to behold.",
          "If you read all the reviews of this 1725 church you will get the feel of what you can expect. If you are into churches of this era it is pretty average but if you are just visiting places of interest then you will think it was a nice place to vist it is really as simple as that.",

          "Situated up an impressive set of steps (which I subsequently saw on the last episode of \"Game of Thrones\") - is also a great photo opportunity. The church itself is a welcome oasis from the bustle of Dubrovnik - stunning ceiling & side chapels. We decided to go here for Sunday",

          "There's only so many Renaissance churches I can take before starting to feel I've seen it all before. Mostly interesting for the Jesuit connection, but personally I preferred the Franciscan monastery (just inside the Pile Gate), and the old synagogue (on Zudioska) - now a museum.",
          "We have visited quite a few churches in the Dubrovnik / Cavtat area and this was our favourite by far. The altar is wonderfully ornate, there is some beautiful artwork and the Our Lady of Lourdes diorama is quite unique. The church is situated at the top of a fair few steps,",

        "wiki": "The eighth and final season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones, produced by HBO, premiered on April 14, 2019, and concluded on May 19, 2019. Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the seventh season, which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. In the first half of the season, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and many of the main characters converge at Winterfell to face the Dead. During the long, bloody battle, which includes aerial combat by dragons, Bran lures the Night King into the open, where Arya destroys him; the army of White Walkers and wights crumble. Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister remains in King's Landing and strengthens her forces to set traps for a weakened Daenerys. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as Daenerys suffers losses until she finally assaults King's Landing on Drogon, her last dragon. She defeats Cersei's forces, burns the city and kills Cersei and her brother Jaime. Daenerys vows to \"liberate\" the whole world as she has liberated the capital of Westeros. Unable to sway her from her destructive path, an agonized Jon kills her. Drogon flies away with her body. The leaders of Westeros choose Bran Stark as King, who grants the North independence and appoints Tyrion his Hand. Sansa Stark is crowned Queen in the North. Arya sails west, and Jon leads the Wildlings north of the Wall.\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. The season was adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.\nThe season was met with mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the widespread acclaim of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website Rotten Tomatoes. Criticism was mainly directed at the writing and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners.\nThe season received 32 nominations at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, the most for a single season of television in history. It won twelve, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\n\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\nThe recurring actors listed here are those who appeared in season 8. They are listed by the region in which they first appear.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nHBO announced the eighth and final season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones in July 2016. Like the previous season, it largely consists of original content not found in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. As Benioff had verified in March 2015, the creators have talked with Martin about the end of the series, and they \"know where things are heading.\" He explained that the ends of both the television and the book series would unavoidably be thematically similar, although Martin could still make some changes to surprise the readers. When asked about why the television series is coming to an end, he said, \"this is where the story ends.\"\n\n\n=== Crew ===\nSeries creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss serve as showrunners for the eighth season. The directors for the eighth season were announced in September 2017. Miguel Sapochnik, who previously directed \"The Gift\" and \"Hardhome\" in the fifth season, as well as \"Battle of the Bastards\" and \"The Winds of Winter\" in the sixth season, returned to direct two episodes. David Nutter, who had directed two episodes each in the second, third, and fifth seasons, including \"The Rains of Castamere\" and \"Mother's Mercy\", directed three episodes for the eighth season. The final episode of the series was directed by Benioff and Weiss, who have previously co-directed two episodes, taking credit for one episode each.At the series' South by Southwest panel on March 12, 2017, Benioff and Weiss announced the writers for the series to be Dave Hill (episode 1) and Bryan Cogman (episode 2). The showrunners divided up the screenplay for the remaining four episodes amongst themselves.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nWriting for the eighth season started with a 140-page outline. Benioff said that the divvying up process and who should write what section became more difficult because \"this would be the last time that [they] would be doing this.\"\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said that instead of the series finale's being a feature film, the final season would be \"six one-hour movies\" on television. He continued, \"The show has proven that TV is every bit as impressive and in many cases more so, than film. What they're doing is monumental.\" Filming officially began on October 23, 2017 and concluded in July 2018. Many exterior scenes were filmed in Northern Ireland and a few in Dubrovnik, Croatia; Paint Hall Studios in Belfast were used for interior filming. The direwolf scenes were filmed in Alberta, Canada.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe eighth season saw the return of Tobias Menzies as Edmure Tully and Lino Facioli as Robin Arryn in the final episode, neither of whom appeared in the seventh season. Marc Rissmann was cast as Harry Strickland, the commander of the Golden Company.\n\n\n=== Content ===\nCo-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have said that the seventh and eighth seasons would likely comprise fewer episodes, saying that after the sixth season, they were \"down to our final 13 episodes after this season. We're heading into the final lap\". Benioff and Weiss said that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the series' usual 12 to 14-month timeframe, as Weiss explained, \"It's crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule.\" HBO confirmed in July 2016 that the seventh season would consist of seven episodes and would premiere later than usual in mid-2017 because of the later filming schedule. Benioff and Weiss later confirmed that the eighth season would consist of six episodes and would premiere later than usual for the same reason.Benioff and Weiss said about the end of the series: \"From the beginning, we've wanted to tell a 70-hour movie. It will turn out to be a 73-hour movie, but it's stayed relatively the same of having the beginning, middle[,] and now we're coming to the end. It would have been really tough if we lost any core cast members along the way[;] I'm very happy we've kept everyone and we get to finish it the way we want to.\" The first two episodes are, respectively, 54 and 58 minutes long, while the final four episodes of the series are all more than an hour in length\u2014episode three is 82 minutes (making it the longest episode of the series), episodes four and five are each 78 minutes, and the final episode is 80 minutes.A two-hour documentary, Game of Thrones: The Last Watch, which documents the making of the eighth season, aired on May 26, the week after the series finale.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nRamin Djawadi returned as the series' composer for the eighth season. The soundtrack album for the season was released digitally on May 19, 2019 and was released on CD on July 19, 2019.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Broadcast ===\nThe season premiered on April 14, 2019 in the United States on HBO.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nOn December 6, 2018, HBO released the first official teaser trailer for the eighth season. A second teaser trailer was released on January 13, 2019, which announced the premiere date as April 14, 2019. The trailer was directed by David Nutter. HBO released a promotional advertisement with Bud Light on February 3, 2019 during Super Bowl LIII. Later, first-look photos of several main characters were released on February 6, 2019. On February 28, posters of many of the main characters sitting upon the Iron Throne were released. The official full trailer was released on March 5, 2019.\n\n\n=== Illegal distribution ===\nThe season premiere was reportedly pirated by nearly 55 million people within the first 24 hours of release. Of these numbers, 9.5 million downloads came from India, 5.2 million came from China, and 4 million came from the U.S. On April 21, 2019, it was reported that the second episode of the season was illegally leaked online hours before it aired due to being streamed early on Amazon Prime Germany. On May 5, 2019, it was reported that the fourth episode of the season was leaked online, with footage from the episode circulating on social media.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe season was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on December 3, 2019.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe season received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 58% based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 6.5/10, the lowest rating for a season of Game of Thrones. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Game of Thrones' final season shortchanges the women of Westeros, sacrificing satisfying character arcs for spectacular set-pieces in its mad dash to the finish line\".The first two episodes were met with mostly positive feedback. On Metacritic, the premiere garnered a score of 75 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" \"The Long Night\" was praised for the cinematography and grand scale of the battle between the living and the dead, but was criticized for its lack of catharsis, disorienting lighting, and the anticlimactic ending of the White Walker storyline that had been built up for seven seasons. \"The Last of the Starks\" and \"The Bells\" were criticized for their rushed pacing, writing, and deviation from character development, with \"The Last of the Starks\" being labeled as \"anticlimactic\" and \"a huge letdown.\" \"The Iron Throne\" was described as \"divisive\", and according to Rotten Tomatoes, the series finale represents \"a modest rebound\" but it \"went out with a whimper.\" \"The Bells\" and \"The Iron Throne\" are the worst-reviewed episodes of the entire series on the website, with an approval of 49% and 48% respectively, while the last four episodes of the season \"plunged to record low scores.\"\nDavid Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the final season \"has been the same story over and over again: a lot of tin-eared writing trying to justify some of the most drastic story developments imaginable, as quickly as possible. As usual, the actors did their best with what was on the page.\" Lucy Mangan of The Guardian wrote that the final season \"has been a rushed business. It has wasted opportunities, squandered goodwill[,] and failed to do justice to its characters or its actors.\" Zack Beauchamp of Vox wrote that the final season \"dispensed almost entirely with trying to make sense of its characters' internal motivations \u2014 let alone the complex political reality that its psychological realism initially helped create.\"Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote that the series ultimately betrayed its \"identity\" of \"tragedy and injustice\" with a \"pandering\" ending. Judy Berman of Time wrote that the series failed to complete the answer to \"conflicting ideas about freedom, justice and leadership\"; these were themes that previously brought depth to the series. Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly agreed that the final season was not as complex as previous seasons. Franich gave the final season, featuring \"big-huge set pieces,\" a 'C' rating. The final season's \"broseph mentality shined through,\" shunting the interaction between female characters. Additionally, Franich criticized Cersei doing nothing this season, as well as the ultimate focus \"on Jon Snow, the least complicated main character.\"Huw Fullerton of Radio Times wrote that the eighth season was not \"Thrones at its best\" but still had \"some sort of ending for the characters.\" For Fullerton, the season was \"like the finale \u2014 some bits I liked, one or two I loved, an awful lot that leaves me scratching my head.\"\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\n\n\n=== Audience response ===\nA petition to HBO for \"competent writers\" to remake the eighth season of Game of Thrones in a manner \"that makes sense\" was started on Change.org after \"The Last of the Starks\" aired, but went viral after \"The Bells\" aired. The petition described showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss as \"woefully incompetent writers\". As of September 6, 2019, it has amassed over 1.73 million signatures. Digital Spy reported that fans of the series criticized the season for the way it handled several character arcs and the \"rushed\" pacing. The petition's creator stated that he never expected HBO to remake the season, but saw the petition as a message \"of frustration and disappointment at its core\".The petition was labelled as \"disrespectful to the crew and the filmmakers\" by actress Sophie Turner (who plays Sansa Stark), \"ridiculous\", \"weird, juvenile\" by actor Isaac Hempstead Wright (who plays Bran Stark), and \"rude\" by actor Jacob Anderson (who plays Grey Worm). Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen) indicated she was previously unaware of the petition, but gave a warmer response when she was asked what she would want to see happen if the eighth season were redone: \"I can only speak to my own character, and the people that I interact with on the show. But I would've loved some more scenes with me and Missandei. I would've loved some more scenes with me and Cersei\".Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun Times, wrote: \"Over the last 25+ years, I've reviewed thousands of movies and dozens of TV shows, and I don't think I've ever seen the level of fan (and to a lesser degree, critical) vitriol leveled at [this show] in recent weeks\". However, Roeper noted that social media was not yet widely used during much of this time period.Lenika Cruz, writing for The Atlantic, wrote that with the end of the series, \"there are folks who don't feel as though the hours and hours they've devoted to this show have been wasted\", but \"there are many others\" who felt the opposite. Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote that the ultimate ending of the series was not what fans \"signed up for\".CBS News has described several plot points that fans are dissatisfied with: the character arcs of Daenerys and Jaime; the fates of Jaime, Missandei, Rhaegal, and the Night King; the Battle of Winterfell being visually too dark; the \"basic existence of Euron Greyjoy\"; and \"Jon's treatment of Ghost\".\n\n\n=== Cast response ===\nIn an interview published just as the final season premiered, Kit Harington said, \"whatever critic spends half an hour writing about this season and makes their [negative] judgement on it, in my head they can go fuck themselves. [...] I know how much work was put into this [...] Now if people feel let down by [this final season], I don't give a fuck\u2014because everyone [working on the series] tried their hardest. That's how I feel. In the end, no one's bigger fans of the show than we are, and we're kind of doing it for ourselves.\"In an interview with The New Yorker, Emilia Clarke said she had to hold back her innermost anxiety from Beyonc\u00e9: \"I was just, like, Oh, my God, my absolute idol in life is saying that she likes me, and I know for a fact that by the end of this season she's going to hate me. [...] All I wanted to scream was 'Please, please still like me even though my character turns into a mass-killing dictator! Please still think that I'm representing women in a really fabulous way.'\"Nathalie Emmanuel, who played Missandei, was heartbroken when she read her character's sudden demise: \"...I think the fact that she died in chains when she was a slave her whole life, that for me was a pungent cut for that character, that felt so painful\". Emmanuel, who was the only woman of color who was a regular on the series for the last several seasons, said, \"It's safe to say that Game of Thrones has been under criticism for their lack of representation, and the truth of it is that Missandei and Grey Worm have represented so many people because there's only two of them.\"Conleth Hill, who played Varys, told Entertainment Weekly that the seventh and eighth seasons were \"kind of frustrating\" and not his \"favorite\", noting that Varys \"kind of dropped off the edge\". Hill reacted with \"dismay\" to Varys apparently \"losing his knowledge\": \"If he was such an intelligent man and he had such resources, how come he didn't know about things?\" After being \"very bummed to not have a final scene with [Littlefinger]\", Hill was \"bummed not to have any reaction to [Littlefinger] dying, if he was [Varys'] nemesis\". Also, once the series ran out of book material as a source, Hill noted that \"special niche interest in weirdos wasn't as effective as it had been\". However, Hill was \"not dissatisfied on the whole\" regarding the series.Lena Headey had a \"mixed\" initial reaction to the manner of death of Cersei Lannister, the character she played. Headey would rather have Cersei die by \"some big piece or fight with somebody\". Eventually, fellow actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau persuaded Headey on how to appreciate the scene, and she said her eventual belief that \"it seemed like the perfect end for\" Cersei because Cersei and Jaime \"came into the world together and now they leave together\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nWith 32 nominations, Game of Thrones broke the record of the most nominations received by a regular TV show in a single year.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGame of Thrones \u2013 official US site\nGame of Thrones \u2013 official UK site\nGame of Thrones \u2013 The Viewers Guide onHBO\nGame of Thrones \u2013 list of episodes on IMDb\nList of Game of Thrones   episodes at TV.com\nMaking Game of Thrones on HBO",

        "wiki": "Gru\u017e (Italian: Gravosa - Santa Croce) is a neighborhood in Dubrovnik, Croatia, about 2 km northwest of the Old City. It has a population of approximately 15,000 people. The main port for Dubrovnik is in Gru\u017e as well as its largest market and the main bus station \"Libertas\".  While historically a manufacturing and industrial base for Dubrovnik, today it is one of the city's main residential areas along with Lapad and Moko\u0161ica.\nFrom the 13th century and greatly through the 16th, Gru\u017e was a separate town from Dubrovnik that provided a summer retreat for the inhabitants of the Republic of Ragusa.  The shores, like those of Ombla, are populated with a great many stone homes and former summer palaces that are surrounded by cultivated grounds.\nStarting in December, 1910, Gru\u017e was the terminus point for the now defunct Dubrovnik tram that ceased running in 1970 following a deadly accident where the tram slipped off its rails and landed in the park in front of Pile Gate.  The line has since been replaced by bus routes.\nLocated in a naturally protected bay, the port was used an Austro-Hungarian naval facility until the end of 1918 and today is able to accommodate large passenger cruise ships. Ferries run from the port to the Elaphiti Islands and Mljet regularly. There is also a customs building for ferries that are international arrivals, specifically from Bari.\nGru\u017e sits right at the entrance to Port Ombla.  It is directly across the water from Cantafigo point, which lacks anchorage points due to the shores and the bottom of the inlet being immersed by banks of mud, deposited during heavy rains. Vessels belonging to Dubrovnik spend their winters at Gru\u017e. Violent squalls descend from the highlands bring the cold, northerly bora, but the waters in the bay of Gru\u017e remain calm.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Dubrovnik (Croatian: [d\u01d4bro\u02d0\u028bni\u02d0k] (listen); historically Ragusa) is a city on the Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.\nThe prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as dubron, a Celtic name for water (Gaulish dubron, Irish dobar, Welsh d\u0175r, dwfr, Cornish dofer), akin to the toponyms Douvres, Dover, and Tauber; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word d\u01ebb\u044a meaning 'oak'. The term dubrovnik means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word dub, d\u00e0b, means 'oak' and dubrava, d\u0105browa means the 'oakwood'.\nThe historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form \u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Rhaousin, Latinized Ragusium) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek \u1fe5\u03ac\u03be, \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"grape\"; from Greek \u1fe5\u03ce\u03be, \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \"narrow passage\"; Greek \u1fe5\u03c9\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \"ragged (of rocks)\", \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2) \"fissure\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"Pelasgian\"), from a root cognate to Greek \u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \"fissure\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Bra\u010d, Elaphousa.The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (\u1fec\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd) is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km (9 mi) to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \u03bb\u1fb6\u03b1\u03c2 \"rock, stone\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio (c. 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \"rocky island\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions.Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.\nThe size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.\nThere is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.Antun Ni\u010deti\u0107, in his 1996 book Povijest dubrova\u010dke luke (\"History of the Port of Dubrovnik\"), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Kor\u010dula, 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) apart from each other.\n\n\n=== Republic of Ragusa ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205\u20131358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro\u0161 I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum. After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, sold Pelje\u0161ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tribute at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, especially Italy, brought her into the full current of the Western Renaissance.Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map.\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A 20 km (12 mi) water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\nThe city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.\n\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the Latin: Libertas word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\nMany Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of \u0160ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and HMS Saracen. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic..\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \"Slavic\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of \u017dupa Dubrova\u010dka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. \nThe Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.\n\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\n\nWhen the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.The combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. \nIn 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko\u0161ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.\nIn 1832, Baron \u0160i\u0161mundo Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795\u20131860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \"Baron\".\nCount Rafael Puci\u0107 (Raffaele Pozza), (1828\u20131890) was elected for first time Podest\u00e0 of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Kor\u010dula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest\u00e0) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puci\u0107, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \"Slovinac\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebi\u0107, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.\nIn 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldi\u0107-Gunduli\u0107 founded the Societ\u00e0 Philately on 4 December 1890.\nIn 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buni\u0107 \u2013 certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project \u2013 was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato \u0160ari\u0107, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graci\u0107, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Kati\u0107 and Antun Mili\u0107. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.\nPero \u010cingrija (1837\u20131921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.\n\n\n=== Yugoslav period (1918\u20131991) ===\n\nWith the fall of Austria\u2013Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.\nDuring World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950. The \"Adriatic Highway\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.A villa on Dubrovnik\u2019s Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family. It now belongs to a Croatian entrepreneur.\n\n\n=== Since 1991: Breakup of Yugoslavia and its aftermath ===\n\nIn 1991 Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared their independence. At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia.\nDespite demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatovi\u0107, and prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili\u0161i\u0107. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing.\nGeneral Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack.The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F), and at night drop to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F). Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.\nAir temperature\naverage annual: 16.4 \u00b0C (61.5 \u00b0F)\naverage of coldest period: January, 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F)\naverage of warmest period: August, 25.8 \u00b0C (78.4 \u00b0F)\nSea temperature\naverage May\u2013September: 18.7\u201325.5 \u00b0C (65.7\u201377.9 \u00b0F)\nSalinity\napproximately 3.8%\nPrecipitation\naverage annual: 1,020.8 mm (40.19 in)\naverage annual rain days: 109.2\nSunshine\naverage annual: 2629 hours\naverage daily hours: 7.2 hours\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.\nThe patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.\nFebruary 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\"In the bay of Dubrovnik is the 72-hectare (180-acre) wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.\nAmong the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.\nBy 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.\n\n\n=== Important monuments ===\n\nFew of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa\u00e7ade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection.The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\nThe 31-metre-high (102 ft) Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church).\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to 51.2 cm (20.2 in).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Walls of Dubrovnik ===\n\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) around the city. The walls are 4 to 6 metres (13\u201320 feet) thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe total population of the city is 42,615 (census 2011), in the following settlements:\n\nThe population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991 In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nDubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near \u010cilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru\u017e. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.\nThe A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Plo\u010de, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology),   a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFranco Sacchetti (Ragusa, 1332 \u2013 San Miniato, 1400), poet and novelist\nBenedetto Cotrugli (Ragusa, 1416 \u2013 L'Aquila, 1469), humanist and economist.\nBonino de Boninis (Lastovo, Ragusa, 1454 \u2013 Treviso, 1528), typographist and bookseller.\nElio Lampridio Cerva (Ragusa, 1463 \u2013 1520), humanist, poet and lexicographer of Latin language\nMarin Dr\u017ei\u0107 (Ragusa, 1508 \u2013 Venice, 1567), playwright, poet and dramaturge\nMarino Ghetaldi (Ragusa, 1568 \u2013 1626), mathematician\nGiorgio Raguseo (Ragusa, 1580 \u2013 1622),  philosopher, theologian, and orator\nRajmund Zamanja (Ragusa, 1587 \u2013 Ragusa, 1647), theologist, philosopher and linguist.\nIvan Gunduli\u0107 (Ragusa, 1589 \u2013 1638), writer and poet\nAnselmo Banduri (Ragusa, 1671 \u2013 Paris, 1743), numismatist and antiquarian\nRu\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1711 \u2013 Milan, 1787) physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian\nMato Vodopi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1816), bishop of Dubrovnik\nMatija Ban (Dubrovnik, 1818), poet, dramatist, and playwright\nMedo Puci\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1821), writer and politician\nKonstantin Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1832), politician, university professor and rector in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Habsburg Monarchy\nIvo Vojnovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1857), writer\nDubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d Srebotnjak (Dubrovnik, 1940), pianist\nAndro Knego (Dubrovnik, 1956), basketball player, Olympic and World champion\nDragan Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1962), water polo player, two-time Olympic champion\nNikola Prka\u010din (Dubrovnik, 1975), basketball player\nVlado Georgiev (Dubrovnik, 1976), pop singer, composer, and songwriter\nFrano Vi\u0107an (Dubrovnik, 1976), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nEmir Spahi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1980),  football player\nMiho Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1983), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nNik\u0161a Dobud (Dubrovnik, 1985), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nLuk\u0161a Andri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nHrvoje Peri\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1985), basketball player\nAndro Bu\u0161lje (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nPaulo Obradovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1986), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMaro Jokovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nAnte Tomi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), basketball player\nAndrija Prlainovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1987), water polo player, Olympic, World and European champion\nSandro Sukno (Dubrovnik, 1990), water polo player, Olympic and World champion\nMario Hezonja (Dubrovnik, 1995), basketball player\nAlen Halilovi\u0107 (Dubrovnik, 1996), football player\nAna Konjuh (Dubrovnik, 1997), tennis player\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nDubrovnik is twinned with:\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nThe HBO series Game of Thrones used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King's Landing and Qarth.Parts of Star Wars: The Last Jedi were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie Fan (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan. \nIn early 2017, Robin Hood was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.In Kander and Ebb's song \"Ring Them Bells,\" the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.The text-based video game Quarantine Circular is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.\nThe Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987. Often regarded as a 'Supergroup' due to the band members having played in various established bands such as Hoodoo Gurus, Beasts of Bourbon, and The Scientists. The band chose their name due to two members of the band Roddy Radalj (guitar vocals) and Boris Sujdovik (bass) being born in Dubrovnik.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDalmatia\nDubrovnik chess set\nList of people from Dubrovnik\nRepublic of Ragusa\nTourism in Croatia\nWalls of Dubrovnik\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Ragusa\", Bradshaw's Hand-Book to the Turkish Empire, 1: Turkey in Europe, London: W.J.

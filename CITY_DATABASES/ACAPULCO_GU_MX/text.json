        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

          "We paid more for a table at a restaurant overlooking the cliff where the divers went, and it might have been a little too far away from the action. It probably would be better to go down to the observation area (where, obviously, the more clued in tourists went).",
          "We attended the lunch show and the night fire show. Lunch was delightful and great value with the show. Night time is spectacular...buy the shirt ($8)! Take $ or pesos to tip the divers...that is what they work for\ud83d\ude09At night we saw a young Nino maybe 7 who also jumped\ud83d\ude16scarey.",
          "You will be mesmerised with these divers jumping off high cliff. Our biggest surprise was that to get up there they simply climbed up almost vertical cliff wall, in our book probably the most dangerous part of the show. Go at least an hour before the show if you want to have",
          "When in Acapulco, the cliff divers are a must. Entrance cost is $40 pesos or $2.50 USD. The divers are incredible, climbing up the cliff of 35 meters to dive into approximately 3 meters of water. Don\u2019t miss the silver jewelry store across the street for some reasonably priced",
          "The Cliff Divers are amazing!The divers scale the cliffs with spider-like agility. It is almost unbearable to watch them dive! There is very little room for error. Still they dive with confidence and grace.",
          "A must stop the cliff divers are brave and gave a great show! This is also where did one of his scenes. Make sure you have a camera. The night show is suppose to be fantastic.",
          "Not only because of the movie by Elvis Presley but because it is a must see diving show. I see it every time I have a chance when visiting Acapulco",
          "Everyone I suppose has seen pictures of the divers at La Quebrada. But I was not prepared for the reality and the scope of what they performed. They free-climbed the rock wall with the ease of mountain goats, then jostled with other as they stood on the edge of the cliff, 35",
          "We enjoyed the show, my kids were super excited each time a person would jump. We watched from the El Mirador restaurant. We paid for the Quebrada show and two drinks for 170 pesos. The food was expensive for what it was so we are somewhere else on our way back to the hotel. The",
          "I went at night and there were people selling food and souvenirs on the street. The show was great, however, depending on where you stand to watch the show you may not be able to see everything. The boys who were diving were very entertaining.",
          "We did a tour with tour by Van with Rudy and it included this stop. Our tour got us the best seats in the house while every one else had to stand in the hot sun. It was so thrilling to see these men dive. It was the highlight of our tour in Acapulco.",
          "Its really nice and interesting to see the cliff divers. They have food they have a lot of things around.",
          "There is not much to say because this is the most famous thing in Acapulco and everyone already knows what to expect. We still think it is worth seeing on every trip.",
          "Incredible experience in Acapulco, you coming to this City you need to go to La Quebrada. . The show take about 15 minutes , try to hire a cab , shipper. And in the end you will take a picture with all the divers.",
          "To be honest - not impressed. The boys had great jumps - they jump from a 30m cliff. They are surely not diving, just jumping off the cliff. And to watch that you have to pay 40 pesos. Same show can be watched from the road which is 50m away and you just cant see the last part",
          "Great show of a must see in Acapulco. We saw the noon show and we were please to find a clean and neat place. I recommend to arrive early to find your favorite spot to enjoy the show. You can bring your favorite drinks and snacks but collect all your garbage. The fee to access",
          "A well spent afternoon with your family. A true iconic, unique place in Acapulco - \u201cLa Quebrada\u201d. Highly recommended.",
          "This is the second time I have been to see the cliff divers. I was a bit disappointed as their were only 3 divers. The prior time, about 2 years ago there were at least 6 divers. It is amazing to watch them climb up the cliff and then to make the high dive. I highly",
          "Amazing watching the jumpers climb and then dive. Very cool. Nice dinner but not the best we had. It was a Christmas buffet- there where some good portions, but not everything",
          "We have visited Acapulco several times over the years and this is our fav attraction. The divers are all amazing and the night show is spectacular! There is so much old world charm in old town Acapulco - we love it!",
          "La Quebrada-one of the most famous places in Acapulco and definitely a place you must visit. This was a one of the attractions of the day trip we too with Sebastian Hernandez (our local tour guide) - what fun we had. The divers entertain tourists by jumping off two cliffs -",
          "What a site to see these cliff divers not only dive but then watch them climb back up to the top. we saw them from the bay which put us a little further away, but 3 divers swam out to our boat for pictures. This is a must see if ever in Acapulco, Mexico.",
          "A must if this is your first time to Acapulco. We chose the option with the meal in the restaurant overlooking the cliff",
          "This was so cool to watch. These divers are amazing. We saw the 1 pm show, which was super hot\u2014the only downside. They put on a very entertaining show, but it is short.",
          "Our tour guide bought us here to view the cliff divers and we ended up having the fish tacos (fantastic as well\ud83d\udc4d). Great viewing platform as well for the divers\ud83d\ude00",
          "The view in this picture is from sitting at the restaurant and awaiting the cliff divers to perform their stunts. The restaurant offers delicious food and it's the perfect seating spot to observe the cliff divers.",
          "The climb undertaken by the divers to get to where they jump is as impressive as the dive.It takes your breath away.Very little margin for error.Well worth a visit.",
          "Our tour guide Roberto Alarcon brought us for lunch here on our tour. What an amazing experience watching these talented divers.",
          "Been dreaming of this since I was a kid watching ABC wide world of sports. Only lasts 1/2 hr but worth the trip as there is so much to see in the area",
          "Cliff divers at night with dinner fantastic experience and good food. Must do in Acapulco very exciting",
          "Our tour got us onto the patio of the hotel so we did not have to climb the 71 steps down and up. View was good and photos turned out well. getting to meet the divers was fun too.",
          "We were less than enthusiastic about this part of our tour as we thought it would be a bit tame. However, we were so wrong. The sight of these divers climbing up the rocks with no safety harness was scary enough, but the diving was spectacular once they had climbed the rocks.",
          "We went to see the cliff divers and were amazed by the dives! One diver dove from half way up the cliff. The remaining divers dove from the top of the cliff. Before they dove they made the sign of the cross, waited for the water to roll in then they DOVE! it was fantastic!",
          "Our tour guide organised a private area for us to watch the divers. Well worth the $7 for a beer. Excellent show.",
          "It has been years since I went to see the divers at Acapulco and it is still an iconic experience. The road up to La Quebrada has been improved and the parking was organised. We paid 30 pesos to park our car. The entrance to the divers is 40 pesos for adults and 15 for children.",
          "This is a must to see. It is a very dangerous job and was amazing how they time their dives with the waves.",
          "Great show and the restaurant food was delicious try the enchiladas. Great view beautiful place...highly recommend",
          "The divers were incredible! I couldn't believe how they risk their lives diving from the top of this cliff and into the water! I'm from Hollywood, California, and this show beat any of the ones I saw at home! I loved it! The food was also delicious. I drank their water and there",
          "I'd seen the video before, but there's no substitute for watching people dive headfirst off a 100+ foot cliff in person. It's pretty amazing what they can do! We came on a cruise ship tour, which meant it was very crowded. If you come on a tour, skip the shop that they tell you",
          "No trip to Viejo Acapulco is complete without a trip to La Quebrada to see the divers tempt fate as they dive into the narrow gorge on the oncoming waves. The exhibition is neither expensive nor long, but it certainly is exciting. I'd recommend you avoid the hot sun at the 1:00",
          "Just want to say that this was one of many great thing we did out here. We where out here for 4 nights 5 days. And did coastal tours and city tour . It was the best way to experience Acapulco most beautiful sites. I am not going to lie me ad my boyfriend were a bit nervous do to",
          "They were amazing. Lots of young children diving and selling souvenirs in the area. Worth the drive.",
          "A unique thing which only takes place in Acapulco, this is why I can recommend it. Bring a headcover, it can take a while until they all jumped.",
          "The story behind the cliff diving was very interesting and I am glad that I got to see them diving. Personally I wouldn't make a dinner out of it though.",
          "There is no other place in the world like \"La Quebrada\", The Cliff Divers Show in Acapulco its absolutely UNIQUE. A must for anyone\u00b4s \"Bucket List\" of what to do while visiting Mexico.",
          "This was number 1 thing on my wife's list to see. Our driver and guide Angel recommended the 1:00PM diving which fit our schedule. I wasn't able to go all the way down the many steps due to recent foot surgery but Angel took me to an stone patio enclosure where I could sit on a",
          "Costs 30-40 pesos per person to go in to the viewing area. This gets you a show of about 5-6 dives. Awesome to see.",
          "I've never seen such a amazing show. That guys are \"crazy\". Divers entertain tourists by jumping off of two ledges on the cliff, one that is 40 feet (12 m) high and the top one which is 80 feet (24 m) high. The divers must calculate the right moment to jump to catch an incoming",
          "the divers were professionals, great form and great skill. So brave as well. The lunch was excellent.",
          "Sebastian of acapulcoforall.com took a group of us on the city tour. He is great I highly recommend him for tours and even airport transfers. He offers beer and even as a bottle of tequila you can pour yourself a shot during the tour. Awesome sight! Amazing view and fearless",
          "The chapel of peace was a beautiful sight. The history and origins of the building was interesting, including how it evolved from a Catholic chapel, and is now open to all denominations. The cliff diving sight was awesome, a must see sight during your time here. Our driver",
          "One of the most spectacular attractions in Mexico. Profesional divers climb to the top of the cliff to dive into a narrow sea strip with a high level of difficulty and risk. A local tradition of many years that every tourist must visit. One of the highest in the world. A must.",
          "When in Acapulco, right? Neat area and restaurant. The divers were amazing to watch. Enjoyed the history of the area.",
          "We had a good lunch and watched a exciting show by the cliff divers. That show was on my Moms bucket list to see, we got it checked off and she loved it.",
          "We did the daytime show because we want to catch them diving in still photos and video cliffs. Super impressive !",
          "La Quebrada are many things, a special place near a sea cave called la Cueva del Diablo (The devil's cave), a place where cliff divers risk their lives everyday and an historical and traditional place in the old Acapulco. La Quebrada is worth going mostly by both, this is where",
          "We saw 6 divers from the age of 7 to 38 diving. We waited a long time before they dived. Some did flips and some did back dives. Cost 40 pesos each.",
          "This was the location of the cliff divers. You will be amazed at how high the divers just from, truly incredible. You should find the time to go watch their show. There are a number of divers who jump from different heights.",
          "The experience watching the divings is incredible. The guys are so talented and it seems they have trained a lot. The entrance to a very good place for watching the show is very cheap.",
          "Went on tour with tour guide Roberto Alarcon! It was fun and we ate at the restaurant, which was good.",
          "It's a great place to see a native pleople to see how brave they are to Jump from ceirtan altitud becarse in the bottom it very full of rocks so they have to be very experience",
          "35 mts jump from \"La quebrada\" every day in this beautiful place of old Acapulco. Great views from a Yacht are suggested. Do not miss this experience!!!!!! Every day starting at 8 pm. And at 10 pm divers jump with torches. Bravo!!!!",
          "We were there when it was raining, and if you are there when it's wet, watch your step on the slippery floors. The cliff divers are amazing- there's a prayer station on the cliff, and some of the divers pray as they prepare themselves for the dive. Why is equally amazing is how",
          "The place has many great seats with a view of the Wolrd Famous cliff diving. sure you can stand it the sun and get a little closer or sit here and watch it all. if you have trouble walking this is a must.",
          "Wow was cool, watching them climb the rocks then jump off, was really neat to watch, do the show with drinks its cheaper",
          "Saw the evening (730pm) performance. It was quite interesting! Get there early to take advantage of the food and shopping.",
          "This is a must when in Acapulco. Cliff Divers make a very exciting show. Very inexpensive and fantastic... make sure you tip them well! PS: make sure you arrive early and get a good spot where you can see the water and diving area otherwise very difficult tio see with all the",
          "The cliff divers of Acapulco is one of the iconic activities of the city. For decades, a small group of divers have been performing, diving from ever increasing heights along the cliff. The square above the stairs and viewing platform is usually full of vendors selling",
          "Well past its glory days but a must if you've never been. It's so unique and traditional to Acapulco and so much a part of its history .... reminders of which are everywhere. Buy a ticket at the hotel for one beer, 'cause that way you'll get a good seat & viewing location.",
          "This is totally worth visit, the divers go all the way to the ocean while they interact with the people and then they climb the rocks to reach the point where they are going to jump. It costs 40 pesos plus they ask for a tip at the end of the show so its basically like 5 dollars",
          "This is a must do for Acapulco. You can view the divers and dine or drink from La Perla which has side view of the divers, The food is nothing to write home about but you can't go wrong with Tequila shots The best view is if you walk all the way down the stairs to a concrete",
          "Apparently the divers are children and grandchildren of past divers and acapulco is famous for their divers. Have several shows a day (at least 2 or 3 ) a must see",
          "Show was nice and very quick.. So you really can't be eating your food or having a conversation while they're diving it happens so fast. It's amazing how they dive off the high cliff.",
          "To watch the men jump never gets old. We walked from the main drag and it was a nice walk if you are a little fit. It costs 20 pesos each for the entrance fee and drinks may be purchased below at a price. Tipping is encouraged to the men.",
          "I found this an excellent attraction and the must do in Acapulco. It is inexpensive, great viewing from across the cliff for excellent views. If you wish, there are numerous choices for food.",
          "There is a restaurant at the HOTEL MIRADOR, named LA PERLA where you can eat great food while enjoying the shows. I strongly suggest to get there by 8:30 pm so you can see the last one with torches\u2026 not to miss if you dare to go to ACAPULCO",
          "You really should not go to Acapulco without visiting the cliff divers show. It is only $40 MXN to watch the young men do their dives, and they put on quite the show. I would recommend going around sunset for the nice lighting.",
          "Your in Acapulco! You have to see the famous cliff divers. It's reasonable price makes it a must. The show is not too long so it doesn't take too much time out of your day.",
          "Very unique place. Amazing views and entertainment watching the divers. Popular place. Breathtaking moment watching the last diver jump from the highest cliff. Worth to visit! Amazing sunset.",
          "Watching the divers here was amazing!! There was plenty of shade, cold drinks, and hot food. Much better than standing out in the hot sun!! I would come here again!",
          "The view is great. Watching the divers is breathtaking but it doesn't last more than 15 mins considering they could be diving to their death. But the show started in the 60's I believe and still goes on today.",
          "Acapulco is well known for its Cliff Diving Show. These divers do put on a good show. Its not a fast paced show, but still incredible to see. Make sure to get to the restaurant early so you can get a good table, have lunch and watch the show. Its iconic if nothing else.",

          "If you really want to see professional acrobats who challenge dead every minute, by the way in a gorgeous view, you must visit this place in the heart of old Acapulco. A perfect place to visit with family or kids and spend a great t\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb me in the local culture",
          "Went on a tour with Acapulco for All and we came here for lunch. Saw the cliff diving show and took pictures with the divers. I had fish tacos with a Corona and it was quite good. They have lunch specials for $12 which includes a meal and 1 drink. Warning: They do except US",
          "Impressive young men. We watched the show from a restaurant called La Perla booked for us by our tour guide Sebastian Hernandez (please check him out at Acapulcoforall.com). I suppose you could pay the entrance fee and watch it at the deck level but our view from the restaurant",

          "This show is a must-see in Acapulco. The divers dive from a height three times that of the Olympic divers.",
          "Paid for a great view with a drink but I think we could've had a better experience on our own. Met a couple of the divers and it was amazing to see their dives!",
          "If you are there for the divers, its fine. Small choice of food selections and nothing special. Too bad because service & location was great.",
          "These cliff divers were astonishing! Good lunch and view! Bring your video camera as it goes very quickly!",
          "Our driver, Angel Flores, recommended that we see the cliff divers at night. We were not disappointed! From the time they come down the stairs of the plaza, climb down one cliff, dive in, swim across, and climb up the face of the cliff bare-handed and bare-footed, the whole",
          "The divers are very impressive. Climbing up the side of the cliffs, preparing for the dive and nailing it at the right time. Couldn't be a better stop at 1:00 during the day to view such talented men.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the cliff divers. We ate dinner at the restaurant, and it was only so-so. I think I'd skip that and just watch the talented divers.",
          "Went with my wife and I to watch the amazing cliff divers at La Quebrada. It was an awesome experience. You can either sit at the restaurant and have a fantastic Meal which is quite reasonable or you can go down to the viewing area to get a closer look of the divers. Either way",
          "When in Acapulco, La Quebrada is a MUST SEE ! We went for diner at 8:15pm saw 3 shows, (8:30pm 9:30pm 10:30pm) each of them exciting and different. The 10:30pm show is very impressive when the last diver goes down with flames. It is worth to pay for the dinner which include a 3",
          "Cool show, a little hard for a 2 year old to sit through so the wife and I passed him back and forth, but overall a good show and the food was amazing.",
          "It is amazing to see how people jump from there every day insane to see it from the boat in order to feel the high and the low bottom depth !! Totally recommended!!",
          "We watched the show from the restaurant. You can do that or watch from the cheaper viewing area below. We got there just before the 9:30 show. We saw the 9:30 show and then they turned the lights off and jumped by fire light. It was amazing! The divers were outside to take",
          "As reviews of la Perla restaurant were not good, we decided to opt for the 40 peso viewing area. It was not overly crowded for the 7:30 show. We found there was a reserved viewing deck for senior citizens and the disabled (just ask) which was very nice as we had chairs in a",
          "A must see in Acapulco!! Amazing! I couldn't believe that they climbed up the side of the cliffs so quickly. Call Baldo Gomez and book this tour. :)",

          "Went here about 12:50 for 1 pm show. 5 dives lasted 45 minutes. That's it. Waited for a diver to swim out to watching boats and collect tips before they would dive. Started diving at 1:25. Needless to say it was hot and people were crowding around the lower area. 157 steps to",
          "the view is very good and the place is really nice the guys who make the show and jump in the sea are experts and it was nice show",

          "The divers climb the cliff with bare feet , bless themselves , milk the crowd for applause, then take a death defying dive into the water. I went at 1 pm and it was very hot. Luckily there was a cold bottle of water plus a cool air conditioned car driven by David",
          "The area is in need of some TLC. Beautiful old buildings. I visited it 20 years ago and it was shabby, now even more so.",
          "Good tacos with a nice view. You can have lunch while watching the cliff divers jump from cliffs into the water. Nice short activity that does not cost too much.",

          "I went to the night time show. It was nice. I was concerned about not being able to see the divers, but that was short-lived. They have very bright lights that easily illuminate the entire area. The show was about half an hour, start to finish. After the show, I was able to",
          "went for the pm show pay to eat in the restaurant the shade is a very welcome break from the noon day sun be prepared to tip the divers the food is mediocre by acapulco standards",
          "The water was extremely rough the night we visited. I was nervous for the divers. But the show was excellent. We saw the 7:30 and 8:30pm shows. Watching them climb the cliff is also a great part of the show. An experience you don't want to miss. We had dinner on a patio",
          "Did the lunch and dive show. Food was good, not great. Drink included which was nice. Only did 4 dives, was expecting a bit more, but amazing none the less.",
          "The seven divers put on a special show for our cruise ship at 10.00am. I'm glad it was early because the main viewing areas are 70 steps down and unshaded, This is the only area in the arena that you can clearly see the divers enter the water. Diving off the top is 130 feet up",
          "The 1:30 show had 5 men who performed. They were great to watch as they climbed the rock wall to the platforms. As they hit the water, you hold your breath that they will reappear to the arousing applause of the on looking crowd.",
          "It felt like it was a bit of hype.The divers were all boys and I know it's not that easy as it seems ,as the cliff was steep and they climb it after getting wet in the water.But,I was not so impressed.",
          "Here you will see the cliff divers, a very cool experience. You can view from the (hot) outside ledge , or have lunch on the shaded patio and a front row seat to the action. Our lunch was $13 USD pp which included fish and hamburgers and a drink. The fish with vegetables and",

          "The place is a good site to visit and see the famous divers that fly in the air and go very close to the mountain rock and sinks in to the beautiful blue sea water.",
          "It's worth going and viewing from the public gallery for just a few pesos rather than pay out for an overpriced meal at the restaurant as the view is just as good and the divers make their way to and from the cliff through the crowd. Saw 2 dive shows and the fire dive for the",

          "At the age of 12 and after about 5 attempts (climbing up to the top and then coming back down again) I finally jumped (not dived) off the 5 metre board at our local swimming baths! These guys dive from 40 metres into water not much deeper than our local pool. Unfortunately,",
          "Going to La Quebrada is something you cannot miss. I recommend you to visit it from monday to friday, because on the weekends it\u00b4s crowded. The 22:30 is with torches, that makes a little bit more special. The divers have to climb and swim to get to the place where they jump,",
          "If you go to Acapulco, you have to see the cliff divers. Watching the divers plunge into the shallow water far below is a heart-stopping spectacle. Not only are the divers dare-devils, but they are excellent divers as well, executing a variety of different dives solo or in",

          "My family recently saw the La Quebrada cliff divers. It is an exhilarating show with death defying flips and dives.",
          "You simply have to do this, being a big part of the attraction of the city. You can see multiple old movies, including Elvis Presley watching this. In fact, if you go watch it at the restaurant in front of it, they have walls and walls of signatures of famous people, from John",
          "We enjoyed the thrilling show and the view from the restaurant was wonderful. The entertainment between shows was also good and we enjoyed good service. The food, however, left much to be desired. The package price was very reasonable and the experience is well worth the",
          "It really must be seen to be believed. Word cannot begin to describe the bravery and spectacle of the cliff divers. Water and a hat are a must if you are unable to get into the shelter of the bar, which does actually give the best view.",
          "La Quebrada was part of our day tour with Sebastian Hernandez Ricardo in early January 2017. The divers are tremendous athletes, jumping from as high as 140-150 feet. The water below is shallow compared to the diving height, and each diver must calculate the incoming wave",
          "This is a must do in Acapulco. It's in the old city with kits of shops and restaurants nearby. Go all of the way down where the divers climb over the wall. It is very inexpensive but the divers want tips. Well worth it and very entertaining.",
          "Maybe this was an attraction 50 yr. ago. You have to pay to get in, than the divers only do 3 scheduled diving shows a day, that last 5 minutes no more and after is over you are asked to give them tip. There is nothing else to do in the close proximity, so if you don't make it",
          "The last time I visited La Quebrada was 50 years ago. The divers are just as impressive now as they were back then! You can't visit Acapulco and not go here. There are great viewing places from top to bottom. The waters are shallow and dangerous. They jump from about 140",
          "Kind of a tourist trap, the diving takes about 3 minutes but they make you wait for an hour. Disappointing",
          "When I first found out that the private tour we were doing ended at the La Quebrada to see Cliff Divers I wasn't sure what to think. But WOW it blow me away! It was a really great show! There was numerous divers from 3 different levels into rocky water below. They first climb up",
          "We went to la perla, it has GREAT views and includes a cocktail with your entrance fee. These young men take their lives in their hands with each dive in to 12 ft of water! We went to the last show of the night. Most enjoyable and daring.... Afterwards looking at all the photos",
          "Evening and night show, the last one at 10.30 pm is performed by the last man with torches in his hand. Now you pay a ticket at the entrance, but is very cheap. Some chairs available on a terrace, close to ticket office, on the right. A very special, traditional attraction you",
          "It's amazing!! Day in-out and multiple times. Day and night showings. Fun family activity. Has a symbolic fee entrance now, which before they didn't. It's okay, I thought. Once you experience what these brave cliff divers do for a living, you'll probably see their side. An",
          "you have to go there at night. very good excellent! great show! great divers they say they have a timing when they have to dive otherwise they will hit the rocks.",
          "The show is nice and the divers are excellent, however, the place does not have comfortable facilities. On high season you must stand behind 2-3 lines of people and probably you wont see anything, on the other hand, there are several shows so you can wait and get a better spot",
          "Did the tour of the city and finished it with the High Cliff Divers. Amazed with the bravery of these young divers (including a woman). If you aren't stunned by this. Just imagine that they climb over the rocks up to their diving platforms in Bare feet. AMAZING!",
          "be prepared to walk many stairs, there is a platform where you can see some views but not the actual drivers going into the water. It is beautiful and the divers very engaging and will pose for a tip! We enjoyed going with Roberto our tour guide and highly recommend him , small",
          "My family got to watch the cliff divers. My son and daughter walked down to be closer to the divers. Older people or handicapped folks cannot go down there. We watched from a shaded balcony in the restaurant. The show was delayed by an hour. The restaurant was a nice cool",
          "It is impressive how these young divers jump so far down. We went at night and looks great. They really do very well.",
          "We just froze when we saw these young boys going off these rock face, its a must to see, be aware thier timed shows, we walked up from the harbour when we berthed and only just managed to see the last of it!! I wouldn't walk again, easier to book a local taxi and go, they know",
          "My friend took me here on my first day in Acapulco. It was pretty great. Heads up, there is a fee to enter the diving area. However, when I went it was open. So, make sure to call them, if they have a number, and find the hours of operation.",
          "Young boys jumping from a cliff in a very narrow space into the sea. Soooo scary! If you do one thing in Acapulco, make it this one.",
          "Quebrada is where you watch the best divers in the world as they jump on a sharp edged cliff to the delight of the crowd. Dangerous yet captivating",
          "the food was very good an the service was great.very nice place watch the cliff divers. We enjoyed the view with a few drinks,",
          "these guy's are the bravest entertainers you could, see. the lunch time show is amazing very hot. best to buy a drink or lunch and watch from the restaurant. great view.",
          "Great experience! However do not fall for the tourist trap of eating at El Mirador hotel or any of the other restaurants surrounding La Quebrada. I've seen the day and night show and would definitely recommend doing the night show.",
          "It was a nice experience to see the famouns Clavadistas. We went to a restaurant were we had a good view, it was very exiting to see them from soo close. Specialy after seeing the insane hight they jump from and how narrow it get !! if you have the possibility great experience !",
          "Must see, enjoyed the divers speedy free form climbing to the dive platform. 40 peso fee per person.",
          "If you have the time to go watch this it is a classic thing to do, this has been going on for many years and the views are stunning. This is a place you want to go when there is a sunset. If you are in Acapulco try to make the time to see this.",
          "Went there on a boat with family and friends to watch the cliff divers jump. It's a very dangerous jump but these people are just fearless and have mastered it. Definitely a cool spot to stop for a drink and watch.",
          "I have been to the cliff divers o many times that I have lost count. Will definitely go again in January, as my granddaughter (who has seen them) is coming to visit me in January with a friend that has never been here. It is very staged, but very dramatic and quite dangerous.",
          "the divers were great, but the dinner was poor(airplane food at best) and not a venue you would book dinner and get a two selection menu of mass pre cooked fair",
          "Really nice place, even they charge $20.00 pesos per person to see the guys jumping but it is really cool!!!",
          "After a horrible food experience, we went down and went down to la quebrada. This place is awsome and beautiful, definetly recommended. They did have the attraction of the divers in to the ocean.",
          "When you are in Acapulco don't miss this amazing experience! Not only the impressive show of the cliff divers but also the setting, the amazing view this place has to offer. The show ends at 8pm and it's very beautiful in the night. Entrance is 40 Pesos and a bunch of taxis are",
          "This is a classic and a must visit while in Acapulco. You see the divers jump off the cliff in almost any movie made in Acapulco. It is a beautiful cliff and I still enjoy today watching the divers jump off into the sea. It's a must visit while in Acapulco.",
          "The divers climb up the cliff and then they dive off the cliff. There were 5 divers and they all did different dives. You must see this show. It takes about 30 minutes. They climb up the cliff rather quickly and then they spend some time warming up . One by one they dive.",
          "This is a must see in Acapulco! These guys are amazing!! We sat in the viewing area in the Hotel Mirador - for about ten dollars or less you get a national beverage of your choice and a great view of the divers. It is a great deal - better than than the 4 dollar platform down",
          "Excellent - had a wonderful time watching the amazing cliff divers whilst in Acapulco. It's a must see whilst here",
          "Best if seen from the ocean as you get a closer look but also can be seen from the Hotel. Incredible guys diving off the cliff from almost 40 meters up. A tradition in Acapulco for years.",
          "Fantastic experience and one not to be missed. I have heard a lot about the brave boys from La Quebrada, but to see this in person is a fantastic experience. We booked seats in the \"La Perla\" restaurant, which offers the best \"comfortable\" views from your table. I would not",
          "Sat at a restaurant called La Perla that over looked the \"Quebrada\" and watched the incredible diving that took place........wow, such brave and skilled young men. Later met them for a photo shoot with us. They were incredible better than I thought",
          "we were on a cruise and one of the ports was Acapulco. It was incredible to watch the boys diving from the high cliffs. This is something not to miss and definitely doesn't disappoint!",
          "we went on a city tour and saw these cliff divers, it was really amazing and I would recommend this for all tourists to see.",
          "When I was a kid I used to watch cliff divers on Wide World of Sports. Now to actually be here in person, Wow",
          "...and a great sunset view to boot!..., these men offer a great show, likely to never forget. 5 shows a day. We went at the 7:30pm one, and exceeded our expectations. Arrive early to choose a good spot.",
          "This where the cliff divers dhow takes place. The divers climb up the cliffs like it is the thing to do and the dives are great!",
          "Went to see the divers/jumpers, lasted for about half an hour, costed 40 peso to get a really good view! Super cool, well worth a visit!",
          "Acceptable Looking nice to watch for one time Is better to stay inside the resturant But don't expect good food Usually one juice is fare",
          "To me, the must thing to see in Acapulco. You can watch for free from different vantage points or you can pay a little and walk down the steps to get really up close and personal. If you eat at La Perla you can watch the show from the restaurant and then watch a later show down",
          "The cliff divers were great! We sat inside with the 2-drink deal... didn't eat there. It was a great show, we were in the shade with a perfect view. A must-do if you are in Acapulco!",
          "This is the most exciting thing I have seen in Mexico,maybe at all. You see different ages men jumping from a click.The story is interesting, the place-restaurant is nice, and the show is amazing.",
          "This is another \"must see\" in Acapulco. These guys do an amazing work at cliff diving. You must be really passionate to do this or I imagine that it remains within a couple of families as a tradition. I saw a kid that did not look any older than 12 doing it. Good performance!",
          "Recommended and impresive. It's is a big performance twice per day! It's a must in acapulco! Go earlier because it is very crowded",
          "Wow what a spectacular show. You definitely need to arrive early because we went to the last show at 10:30 pm and the little ones can't see well because of the amount of crowd you pay 40 per adult and 25 per children.",
          "In this attraction you see people jumping off a clief that is like 30 m tall it is a fasinating and exiting so you shouldn t miss it",
          "It's a place to have a time to relax and look the beautiful scenario. There you can see the waves shocking on the rocks. It's very beautiful.",
          "A spectacular show which now includes a woman diver as well. She is the daughter of one of the older cliff divers. It's one of a kind. The thrill of victory!!",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip. We were there for the first show of the day (near one o'clock) and it was great. I would imagine that it would be ever better at the sunset. The youngest diver that day was a nine year old. The entrance fee is forty pesos, and when you",
          "I guess when you are in Acapylco you have to see this. It is quite amazing when you see those young men jumping down the cliffs. The full \"show\" is over after 15 minutes, but it is worth to see it. Entry fee is 40 pesos per person, so not a lot and in my opinion worth the money.",
          "This is one of those iconic activities always shown when you see travel info about Acapulco. And it did not disappoint! It was exciting to watch the divers climb the rocks to the top, and you could feel the tension as they prepared themselves for the dives. A lot of fun.",
          "The shows that these young men put on is totally awesome. From the smallest to the biggest, these young men do some of the best dives I have seen and off of the cliffs. Once again AWESOME!!!",
          "It's a beautiful place to go walk and spend an evening. You can pay to see the divers jump from the cliffs up close or just watch from afar. There are many street vendors to buy food, drinks or souvenirs.",
          "Our guide took us by here to see the show and eat lunch. Divers jump in on one side, swim across, then climb up 142 feet in nothing but a speedo, and then do flips, tricks, and dive back down in-between massive waves. Lunch is only $15 p/p American and includes one domestic",
          "Enjoyed very much. we Watch the divers from the restaurant while eating A great lunch. Afterwords we were able to get pictures with the divers Highly recommend taking in this experience",
          "I was there for 7 days staying at the crown Plaza A+ and my activities was to see Acapulco. So I went on a sea trip for 3 hours fantastic whith music a live performance, I discover The baie of Accapulco. After that I wnt chopping in Acapulco for souvenir what a great day I",
          "La Quebrada is located in the Old Acapulco it is very easy to access by taxi. There is the public area where you 40 pesos and the restaurant La Perla. If you want to see the divers closer then the public area is the best, if you arrive early you have a great view. Now the",
          "We watched the show at 730pm from Mirador restaurant. You could also choose to pay 40 pesos to stand at the podium just opposite the cliff where they jump. At the restaurant you pay more for drinks - 180 pesos for 2 drinks including entrance to view the jump. The view was",
          "We watched the night divers show and it's a must thing to do when in Acapulco. We watched it from the La Perla restaurant and had a great dinner food (chicken fajitas were amazing). Mind you that there is a cover charge if you want to watch from the restaurant. It's $120 pesos",
          "we went back the week after having been here 10 years ago its is very run down the restaurant was a ghost town no one eating there but a handful of people.it was pretty sad. the worst part is my order was given to me wrong 3 times!!! i sent it back showed him what i wanted point",
          "We had a wonderful evening at La Perla watching the Acapulco divers. The cover charge is $120 pesos to get into the restaurant and for one drink. It's $180 if you want two drinks. There is a 3 course menu for about $400 pesos per person which includes the cover charge. We paid",
          "As part of our city tour, we went to see the afternoon performance of the cliff divers. There is a restaurant on site and there are packages that include dinner and the evening performance. This without a doubt was the best part of our city tour. These young men are amazing to",
          "It has the best views to see the show (clavadistas),but the food wasn't what I expected. First of all it was cold. We orderes the 3 course meal. And you would expect it to be the great, but its nothing special. It waa tasteless I didn't even finish it. Maybe order from the menu",
          "This was one of my top 3 memories in Acapulco! 40 pesos to watch the show from the observatory; show is more than 10xs the value you pay !!! Enjoy \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\ude4f",
          "We viewed the 1st afternoon session for the divers and were amazed and entertained. Had lunch at La Perla while viewing and as part of the city tour hosted by Sebastian Hernandez. Lunch was surprisingly good (shrimp tacos for the adults/burgers for the teens). Several flights of",
          "We paid the $120 Pesos to have drinks and seating inside the La Perla restaurant and the view was perfect. For $40 Pesos you can walk down a long winding staircase and watch the divers up close but since my mom could not walk down all those stairs and back up we chose the the",
          "This is a must do activity. We went for lunch and saw the divers from above, but the real show is later at night down below. It is amazing.",
          "We enjoyed the divers show from the bottom of a long steep staircase, later moving halfway up for another angle. They have nerves of steel or are crazy.",
          "Wow! These guys are unbelievable. We went to the 1 pm show and watched from the public viewing area. I'm glad we did not watch from La Perla since it's really quite far actually from where the divers enter the water. I think we paid @ $5 each and this was one of the best",
          "My husband and I went for Dinner at La Quebrada the last night we were in Acapulco after two weeks vacationing there. The steak we ordered was very good. The show the Cliff divers gave was excellent. It was very romantic.",
          "My understanding is that there is one daytime show. I went the other night and returned today to get better photos. I preferred the nighttime show but it was fun getting photos and meeting the divers!",
          "We were brought here by family that live in Acapulco, so we knew this was going to be good before we even got there. Wow, we are so glad we went! Admission for the balcony (non-hotel) that the divers actually enter from is only 40 pesos for adults (cheaper for kids but I don't",
          "The food was okay, but watching the cliff divers was amazing! By going in the daytime, I could really see them jump in the water, swim to the other side, climb the wall and prepare for their dives. Afterwards, they were eager to sign autographs and take pictures.",
          "The cliff divers were amazing...what we could see. We were in the restaurant at night. The food was excellent!",
          "Excellent show. Did the 1 PM show with lunch, ate at La Pearla. Great food great view. Get there early and get a good seat. You will not be disappointed.",
          "Really enjoyed the Divers' Show. Short (about 15 minute show). Was very hot and there isn't any shade. Many stairs so if you have problems walking, I don't recommend you walk down the many many stairs.",
          "Good place to stare at the sea, the show if the divers too. The shows are at 7pm, 8pm and 9pm. There is a small area full of small booths with vendors selling beautiful art pieces from clay dishes and monuments to food. And lots of taxis to take you back to your hotel.",
          "Skip the \"package\" and order off the regular menu! Excellent service and we watched 2and a half diving shows.",
          "We came to see a 1pm showing and arrived about 12.40pm and paid 40 pesos each to stand right across from the cliffs. It was hot and sunny and we wanted to keep our places at the front so didn't want to move to shade, so bring a hat and a drink! Watching the divers so closely was",
          "We walked through the city to the headland where La Quebrada hosts the divers. We went to the 1pm dive which had about 5 divers, the youngest of whom was 15 years old, and had been training since he was 8 years old. I was very moved by the simple prayers the divers did before",
          "The Acapulco Cliff Divers were the attraction on the first-ever episode of ABC's Wide World of Sports, 55 years ago. They are no less spectacular today. Personally, I find the barefoot climb up the cliff from the water more miraculous the the dive itself, and when you see these",
          "We saw this as part of a city tour and although I was some what sceptical it ended up being very enjoyable. Our driver indicated he thinks the best viewing was from one of the restaurants at the top, and cool off a bit and have a nice lunch. The view was amazing and we also got",
          "These people are amazing, I saw a kid jump of a cliff in the water. nothing but respect for these jumpers....",
          "If you are not a sufferer of vertigo, you will really enjoy these divers making their cliff dives into the ocean swells below. They actually learn to time their jump and their impact with the rise and fall of the water that surges back and forth in the cove. Pretty amazing to",
          "We traveled to see the cliff divers on day 3 of our trip and we were completely astounded by how agile the divers were climbing up the side of the cliffs to their diving positions and then how graceful the were actually diving. It was quite a site.",
          "So much more impressive than watching it on a film or on TV, absolutely thrilling. There are lot of stairs to get right down to the bottom but we had a great view from near the top.",
          "see the drives by day and night. get there early and pick your spot. skip the junk they sell and buy post cards of them in the air.",
          "Very exciting to watch these young men climb up the rocks and dive into the writhing water! Very brave young men.",
          "I enjoyed seeing the divers. If you've never been, it is definitely something to include in your plans. Once you've seen it, you probably won't need to see it again.",
          "Nice lunch, great margarita, fun to watch the divers. Enjoyed the signature wall full of old Hollywood legends.",
          "I visited this attraction several years ago, made very more famous by the Elvis film 'Fun in Acapulco. I am pleased I have seen this attraction, beautiful scenery & brave divers.",
          "Went during the day, had refreshments in the restaurant, saw many divers, an amazing experience. Grandsons will never forget.",
          "Arrive early and go to the restaurant right in front of La Quebrada to have a great view of the divers. The spectacle is great and amusing. Don't expect a fancy restaurant, it is very simple but quite enjoyable.",
          "We saw the divers from the Mirador Hotel but when you see them from La Quebrada you realize how dangerous the dive really is. The divers earn their living from the entrance fee, so please do not begrudge them this money.",
          "That 's an amazing show The guys jump from a mountain to the beach. Incredible! The Night show is more beautiful !",
          "This is one of those tourist attractions that is a must to see... everyone goes here on their visit to Acapulco. But with that said, it is overpriced, the lunch we ate while waiting for the \"10 minute show\" to begin was probably the worst meal we had while staying in Acapulco,",
          "Had been many years ago and viewed by boat. Went by private car this trip at night. Lots and lots of stairs so keep that in mind if your just going to pay the $40 peso to view.",
          "Be prepared to traverse a LOT of stairs unless you watch from the hotel. I'm glad we watched from the platform below, but I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath!",
          "We have seen the show at all times of the day and night. The best show is the last one, where they turn out all the lights and dive with torches. A must see if you are in Acapulco!!",
          "We went about 1/2 way down and could gone all the way down but would still be down their because would not be able to make it back up",
          "World famous cliff divers, had to see! We had to wait for some time in very hot temperatures for the divers to prepare but it was worth it. Divers are all ages and dive from various heights off the cliff face. There are two main viewing areas outside and also from the hotel. We",
          "The best dive show is at 2130...they use torches. We ate at the Hotel mirador (optional) all tables have spectacular views. The meal was a prefixed 3 course menu, and saw two shows while we ate. Food is good but not delicious. Purchased an optional photo for 100 pesos and took",
          "Worth the visit. Spectacular dives! Young men apparently train for years, starting with Olympic high fives in a pool. Beautiful cliff location. Interesting drive to the dive location through back streets of old Acapulco.",
          "I went to La Quebrada as part of a shore excursion from Acapulco. We had seats in one of the local restaurants so the view was just perfect and we could wait in comfort for the show. The divers climb up the rock face with bare feet, pray and then take their turns diving off",
          "I took a Peruvian friend to do \"something you must do in Acapulco\" Obvious choice La Quebrada. Over the years I have come to see the fearless divers that need to time their jump perfectly so the right depth is waiting for them when they reach the water surface. They must jump",
          "I took my teenage kids and smal children (2-3 years old) everybody enjoyed the divers show. Dives start st 1 pm, 7 pm and 8. Prices 40 pesos adult, 20 kids.",
          "How do you describe the amazing feat of scaling a rock face barefoot and then diving into the uncertain waters below?! Graceful, stunning, crazy! We ate at La Perla Restaurant and were able to just turn our chairs to see two complete well-lit evening shows. The 3-course meal",
          "Day was hot so made standing there waiting for the divers a little uncomfortable. Views amazing. Lots of steps to get to the best spot to watch the divers. Diving show Okay. As soon as they hit the water they are up for tips..it's cool..they deserve them. Lots of hawkers around",
          "Beautifully scenic and fun! Many steps down to get close to divers, or there are a few chairs under shade just a little way down the steps, near the toilets. Be sure to tip the divers - only the most experienced get wages from the entry fees. A fun excursion!",
          "These young men put a show on worth seeing, every dive is worthy of seeing, they put themselves at risk every show ,one mistake would be fatal as there is no safety net.",
          "Went to see the cliff divers as part of a Sunwing excursion. Great show!! Something I wanted to see all my life and wasn't dissapointed! Would recommend!",
          "3 couples went to dinner and watch the cliff do version, we had a blast. We each had the pre-fix menu which included 3 courses for $25.00 each plus tip. It also included 2 drinks per person. Everyone's meals were excellent, the service was good and the divers were incredible.",
          "Watching the cliff divers (we watched from the restaurant at the top of the cliff) is really a thrill. It's a short but impressive show.",
          "A breath - taking experience. We loved it. Best at the night, with fire show. Be careful about pocket thief /sorry, don\u00a8t know if it\"s right in English/",
          "Young boys dive a few hundred feet to the ocean below. They take their time to dive when the waves come into the passage way for their safety.",
          "My husband and I loved this and were so glad we stopped off to see the clavadistas here in acapulco. We had lunch at the restaurant which included the viewing platform which others say is a rip off but the food was good and we had a great uncrowded viewing point. The place was",
          "Visited here to watch the famous diver of Acapulco. Very reasonable for drinks and lunch and to watch the divers. Have to visit her if you are in Acapulco",
          "Took a taxi from the hotel, $100 pesos, $40 pesos entrance fee, midweek night show is better, it is not crowded.",
          "Amazing view, the diving show is spectacular. A must see while you are in Acapulco. You should definitely talk to the divers afterwards. Ask them how many injuries they've had.",
          "Visited here as it was on my list of must see places, you cant visit Acapulco unless you do so ! Show was ok if a kittle drawn out , 45 minutes to see 5 divers is a little excessive. Divers where ok but nothing that impressive. Be warned, you will most likely be hassles to",
          "I was always told you couldn't visit Acapulco without seeing the cliff diving. The divers were good however it was a little boring. The show was dragged out quite a lot with not much really happening. I am pleased that I went as it's a part of visiting Acapulco but I wouldn't go",
          "This is fascinating, and it is amazing the precision with which they must dive. A must see while in Acapulco. We also ate lunch at the restaurant there, and it was delicious.",
          "Cliff divers, great icecream, amazing view, weather, only 40 pesos to see the show. If you are in Acapulco you must come here.",
          "Got to the viewing section at 12:50pm on a Sunday for the 1:15pm show. We were lucky to get a viewing spot. Better to get their early enough to be able to stand as close to the wall to see when the diver hits the water. Otherwise you will only be able to see from anywhere them",
          "Have dinner at La Perla. Live music, good food and an excelent view of the cliff divers. Watching the divers at night is bretahtaking... simply a must.",
          "It's a lot of waiting to see a half dozen dives. Certainly brave young men, but sort of like watching Evel Knievel. BTW, there is no need to go to the restaurant with their $15USD cover for two drinks. For 40 pesos (+50 peso tip to the divers), or $6, you can walk down, and",
          "Second time seeing. First time in 2012, and it was a 20 minute performance. In January 2016, the performers jumped/dove only three times but it was a Wednesday night with only a few spectators.Watched both times from La Perla restaurant. Paid $30 pesos per person for entry,",
          "If you are visiting Acapulco this is the attraction you must see! Impressive diving! Great iconic location",
          "We chose to pay the extra money to eat in the restaurant and watch the show from that vantage point. We ordered 10 minutes before the show was to begin. The diving did not begin until 30 minutes later. We enjoyed the diving experience, but the service at the restaurant was",
          "A real show, difficult to find in the city! The swimmers are amazing! The place is a little bit old fashioned.",
          "Th\u00e9 best place to Watch the show is at the restaurant facing the cliff. For 220 pesos you can have a lunch ( fish is very good ) and a drink and see the divers. Go during the week for the 1 o'clock show. That way you get first row.",
          "This has always been a highkight of Acapulco. The skill of these divers, who have been training from very young age, is amazing",
          "I have been to This location three ways... The first from the belvedere, the second by boat, the third the restaurant La Perla! All three experiences were worth it. From the belvedere, the divers walk by you, cute guys... From the boat, they swim to you for money, cute guys but",
          "Been many times. Been in the day and at night. I prefer day as you can see more. At night they dive with the torches. Take house guests when they visit. Unbelievable how they do what they do--and only for tips.",
          "really interesting place. It is good to see once but not twice. you need to cab it there and back. I is located in the older part of town and caution should be used. go at night. You pay an admission fee, but the ticket is worth a beverage. the divers meet you at the end",
          "This is definitely a MUST attraction when visiting Acapulco!!! The divers put on an amazing show day and night!! I do recommend going in the even, it's beautiful and of course less hot;)!! Great family event. You should GO!!",
          "Amazing show....simply incredible. Daring divers will take ur breath away. You cannot visit Acapulco without going to the Quebrada. Elvis Prestley filmed 'fun in Acapulco' there!",
          "We took a tour from our hotel to view the diving. While it was an amazing display of talent and daring it was not worth paying the $15 usd we paid to have a seat at the hotel and watch. They said it was a 30 minute show. Well, they dived six times in all. Again, amazing but",
          "This is another attraction that have decades in Acapulco, if you don't visit it is like you never been here! These guys climbed all the way to the top to dive; they just follow theirs senses to see when is the right time to jump, if they make a small mistake can died instantly!",
          "Ticket price 40 pesos each. We were able to stand in the handicap area as there were few people. This area has an excellent view without the stairs but maybe not always available. The parking was filled and we were happy we took a taxi.",
          "This is a good place to visit during your stay in Acapulco. It is always impressive both the place and how brave the divers are.",
          "Acapulco is mostly visited by Mexican people, some Americans because a lot are worried about safety. Perfectly save resort, particular if you stay in hotels at the edge of the city.",
          "We sat in the restaurant at the cliff, great view spot! We had some drinks while waiting for the divers to start. I really enjoyed it! it was crazy! the water was anything but calm! they had to time their jumps to avoid injury! As we left the restaurant the divers young and",
          "The diving show is quite short so don't be late. The diving is very impressive, but I was amazed at how fast they can climb up the cliffs. Be prepared to give them a few pesos, they deserve it.",
          "It is definitely a must do, but don't expect a big show. 5 to 10 divers (young and old, skinny and fat) climb the ledge and perform the dangerous dive. It's a great tradition and worth while. There are many \"shows\" during the day, so pick one according to your itinerary and get",
          "The men that dive from these cliffs are brave. The night dive is better to see as they really light the place up!",
          "Awe inspiring show in a great location at the restaurant on the cliff. Price included two drinks, on the shaded balcony and the view was breath taking.",
          "Very amazing. I wouldn't think of doing that, but I loved watching them. Sat in restaurant sipping virgin daiquiris. What fun!",
          "Our driver Roberto Alarcon, got us the best seat in the house. The food at La Perla Restaurant was delicious. We had a few choices and we picked the fish fillet and it was delicious. We even got a picture with the cliff divers!",
          "It is so fun to see how the little kids dive into the ocean! And the professionals al awesome! It is better than circ do solei",
          "I came back to this fabulous place and still find it so interesting watching these guys making that dive.",
          "To watch these guys is one of the only free things available in Acapulco. Well worth the visit. Athletic young men risking everything then climbing back up the rocks like Elvis. Chill, relax, enjoy. Then wonder if you could do it yourself.........................?",
          "Going to La Quebrada is a must when in Acapulco. Very traditional feat from very brave men. You will continue to talk about this for days.",
          "My wife appeared to be far more interested in the muscular toned fine young men diving , top effort and a thrilling site, tip generously please it's how they earn a living.",
          "Very cool you have to do it. One afternoon show at 1pm. The show is pretty fast 30 minutes or so, don't be late.",
          "The cliff jumping in Acapulco is a must-see! I have seen it both from the land, and from a boat at sea.In either case, these young people are in amazing physical form and will amaze you as they leap off the cliffs and scurry back up the rocks to go again!",
          "The divers have been doing this for decades and it is definitely something to see in Acapulco. The daytime (1:30pm) show is more worthwhile than an evening shows (7:30pm and 8:30 pm), although we didn't go to the 10:30 finale where they dive with torches. Each show is",
          "If you would like to see 4 to 6 men arrive by water and scale the rocks and then dive- this is definitely for you.",
          "Very nice spot, with parking lot. The view area amazing. I wish I could jump from there like the native ones.",
          "We watched from the hotel overlooking the divers - for 5 pesos you can buy a ticket to their patio and it comes with two drinks. The divers make almost all of their income from admission and tips - on the way out, they waited in their swimsuits to talk to visitors. It was worth",
          "The drivers are unbelievable. There is a great viewing area/accommodation for people unable to walk down the steps. Divers are phenomenal!",
          "6 Divers climb the rocks like goats before leaping off the rock face some 40 mtrs high and into only 4 mtrs deep water",
          "The cliff diving itself is truly spectacular and even more impressive to see it live than in the many quintessential Acapulco promotional photos. The people who manage the venue as a tourist attraction really need to invest in a sound/light system from this century, but their",
          "Without doubt the Acapulco Cliff Divers have been one of the most renowned attractions of that Mexican City and many of us remember those old Hollywood black- and-white movies where the protagonists are sitting at LA PERLA having their cocktails and watching the cliffdivers'",
          "Our guide, Baldo Gomez made arrangements for us to have lunch and watch the cliff divers. The food was excellent at the restaurant where we sat to watch.",
          "We went here for the 7.30pm cliff divers show which is a must see whilst in Acapulco. It is a lovely place in the evening and the divers are amazing",
          "Even though it was not as spectacular in real life as it can be shown on TV or in movies, it was still impressive. Main dangers seem to be ensuring enough forward distance to clear the cliff face and only diving when the channel has enough water depth. Will leave it to them",
          "We've been here several years ago to watch the cliff divers and were very impressed. It was just as spectacular this time around! They put on a very good show. The young men pray next to the little chapel on the cliff before each dive. At the end of the show, they come up to the",
          "The show was amazing, I went to the 930 pm show and paid a little more to watch it from the restaurant; the view was amazing and so was the weather.",
          "Lunch and show package is priced okay. Lunch was okay, service outstanding, and outdoor seating was very comfortable. We arrived an hour before show and got the best seat in house. If your don't order lunch you sit in the peanut gallery. Show was pretty good, but 25 minutes",
          "A must see when in Acapulco! These young men are so brave and put on a wonderful show. Find out the times and get there early to get a better place to view.",
          "Great iconic location. Excellent by day and night. Get there early and get a great spot. Or take a drink in the nearby hotel overlooking the cove. Awesome by day and magical by night.",
          "When in Acapulco this is a must for every one,visited a while back.. It was fantastic to see these brave divers dive so far above the sea.",
          "just do it! awesome spectacle, really worth the trip. we went to the lunch time show, not sure if the evening one would be more spectacular.... \u2026",
          "If you stand at the border of a 12 story building, you will feel what these divers may feel before jumping in to the abyss. Not for nothing La Quebrda divers are renown around the world, watching them jump of the cliff is a must see.",
          "It was a sight to see. To jump off that cliff takes more guts than I will ever have....makes me wonder how they \"work up to it\".",
          "Watching this is incredible because it's not only a matter of diving. You see these guys (I don't think they are older than 25) to climb this massive cliff Wall, and then just jump it like is a flight of stairs. You pay $30 pesos to park and $40 peson per person to go down to",
          "the cliff divers are now young teens who dare jump from the cliff into the turbulent waters the cheaper way to watch the divers is from the view deck across from the cliff",
          "La Quebrada a really beautiful exciting friendly world heritage site as per our evaluation - safe and secure for children- revealing!awesome! Be there for the scheduled dives - el mirador restaurant - exciting dining!",
          "Old School Acapulco. Must see. Divers are pretty brave dudes. I ate at a restaurant that has views of the diving area. It was OK but did offer the best views. Don't forget to tip the divers. They surely won't forget to ask.",
          "It was amazing watching the dives scale the rocks and then dive into the water. Boats from the ocean kept coming in too close to where the divers jump, so divers had to wait for them to move. Each diver, and there were six, only dove one time, so I was a little disappointed",
          "Get there early and enjoy the show in the la perla restaurant.. thats the best way to see the show. I recommend the 10pm diving show because they have ^antorchas`^ with real fire as they dive into the ocean.",
          "As most of the reviews said, it's a cheap car park, 3 minute walk down, you will find around 3 to 4 jumps and the boys that do it, do a great job",
          "While interesting, you would be better off finding an old episode of Wide World of Sports to get a better view. The only vantage point was from within the bar/restaurant, and they were more concerned about selling drinks (of course). Can't blame them, but don't plan on just",
          "Cheap 25 peso beers and a 20 minute show of cliff diving. If you can find the place take a look, maybe even stay for the last show with torches. Then move on, fun and cheap but nothing special",
          "The divers at La Quebrada were exceptional. We had lunch at the restaurant overlooking the cliff and had a front row view of the divers. I would have loved to have gone back to see them at night as they do a sunset dive show as well. Another fun historical activity to do",
          "Very nice place to watch the Mexicans dive in very shallow water. Always many people there, good atmosphere....",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit. The views are awesome and if your lucky you get to see the locals diving. Really nice place to visit but I won't be diving any time soon!!",
          "This was part of a day long private tour. The vendor's are ferocious. Our driver was not allowed to stay but he sat us in the shade on stools. I was grateful for that. Some people walked down further but too hot for me. Our view was great. It just took a really long time",
          "Went here to see the cliff divers, we chose to visit through the La Mirada hotel. you pay a small admission and get two drinks and a tableside view of the cove and divers. Bonus: the lower floor to the patio is covered in autographs and memorabilia of the famous celebs that have",
          "stayed at the La Perla restaurant to watch this divers. It was a 10 US dollar entrance that comes with 1 free drink. There was a group of 8 divers, some of the divers were probably 9-10 years old, jumping from different levels. It was exciting and at the same time dangerous. But",
          "Every traveler must go there. Is one of the coolest things to visit in Acapulco. Brave men jump from a really high height to the ocean and then they climb again in the rocks.",
          "Legendary Quebrada! the view is amazing and the show is spectacular! This is one of the main reasons why so many travel to this paradise beach to see the young men sacrifie their lives as they dive into the beach from very high altitudes. Very impressing! A must!",
          "I have had the yearning to see the divers for a long time, since I saw them on Wide World of Sport as a kid. There were 8 divers and without a doubt they are brave souls but I was left a bit hollow from the experience of the 'show' which lasted about 10 minutes. Worth having a",

          "dangerous city, 800 + murders a year, mainly drug related, be careful traveling around city, stay on main streets & highways",
          "The divers are crazy! It was worth seeing once but so touristy and so many vendors following you and hitting you up to buy their goods; it was almost uncomfortable from that aspect. But unique still!",

          "My grandmother choose the hotel on the mountain for her honey moon, and I believe this place hasn't lost the charm. You will find here the clasical image of Acapulco, people diving from the mountain into the sea. An exciting thing to watch. Be aware there are many steps up and",
          "I like it, it has been the same since I was a small kid, it is amazing to see those men jumping from the top rock counting the waves when the sea is higher so they don't hit down. Great athletes that start since childhood.",
          "the show is definitely worth going to. the guys who dive from the cliff are definitely well trained and very brave. just watching them was scary, can't even imagine how they dive and stay calm:)",
          "These are certainly brave lads and ladies. Watching them jump is really something. You can go in the afternoon and enjoy the sunset too.",
          "Sure, its corny as hell, and feels like something out of a 50\u00b4s movie, but being there, and feeling the general vibe of awe after a daredevil jump from the cliff really makes one wonder... I mean, these people, the high divers come from generations of daredevils, that high dive",
          "We really liked the show and scenery. It is well put together and gives tourist a great show of local divers that make friends with nature and strive to become the best divers in the conditions that mother nature allowed. We went to the hotel and had couple of drinks with very",

          "The divers are awesome. The dive from height into churning dangerous waters and then climb the cliffs and dine again. The have a day show as well as the night show...both are great.",
          "We went there on our own,by taxi,we had a good position to see the divers,and it was very much interested to be there,the divers are young,and very professional specially when climbing the cliff and jumbing in the right time it is very amazing and a must to see that in Acapulco.",
          "You may have seen video of these cliff divers, but nothing takes the place of in person viewing. From your vantage point above the cliffs, you can witness the divers as they swim over and climb the cliffs and begin their dives at about 75 feet up and progress all the way to 125",
          "As a part of our City Tour, too us here approx.1 pm..as the cliff divers , do this 4-5x a day, as the last one 11 pm, most spectacular, with lighted torches.. There were 8 of them, but only 5 climbed up the steep cliff & waited til right timing to dive in, it was definitely",
          "We found it hardly, but was our fault as walked from the hotel. The show was exciting maybe less what we expected. Very brave kids and people. Great experience, must go there if you are in this area.",
          "When I was waiting there to see the divers preparing to jump from the cliffs - 40 to 80 ft high - and praying and waiting to the \"right\" wave to come, it's something that I cannot put into words. You have to SEE ! and uff, when they reach the water\" UNIQUE! Unfortunately",
          "It was more the hype than what went on. I guess I'm used to elaborated shows and this wasn't very attractive. I respect those who do the jumps, but I think they should include something to make it more amusing other than seeing people jump.",
          "Long trip from Encanto by taxi, so expensive. Quebrada divers/restaurant and two drinks on top of that made it very expensive and food not more than one star.",
          "I remember watch these dives as a kid on Wide World Of Sports. It was disappointing to see this in person. Nice way to take up a couple hours, the night diving was ever better.",
          "One of the highlights of visiting Acapulco is the Cliff Divers At La Quebrada. They only dive at certain times of the day and they are not precise. We were there at the 1 PM show which actually took place at 1:35. However it was worth the wait. There is a viewing area far down",
          "Having seen these guys on TV years ago (and in an Elvis movie!) we were excited to see them up close and personal. They did not disappoint! These young men risk their lives putting on a show for tourists. If you ever go, give them a big fat tip! Thanks to the divers and the",
          "Very exciting to see the boys jump from the high cliffs. The restaurant was being remodeled and the rain kept us from sitting close to the railing, however, we were well accommodated toward the back of the patio. The view was excellent, however, it took the divers awhile to",

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

          "The boat tour of the lagoon was a very relaxing experience. Our boatman took the boat to a lotus pond. His young assistant, a 12 year old kid got down in the pond, took out some mud, and applied it to our legs, arms, face. We washed it all out after coming back to the shore. It",
          "Laguna de Coyuca is not very known for the foreign tourist but this place should be visited if you are looking for sweet water, good food, birds and quietness. It is a great place to skiwater early in the mornings. If you do a full tour around the laguna you will be able to get",

          "Prayers and mass is celebrated practicallly everyday. The local bus or a taxi driver can bring you there and the cathedral is so beautiful. They have a lot of vendors, restaurants and colourful stores to visit and shop which are very close to the cathedral. Would definitely",
          "We walked around 20 minutes from the cruise ship terminal to the main square (Zocalo) and found this cathedral. You cannot miss it. It's quite striking in appearance with its blue dome. The blue and gold theme continues inside.",
          "This is a very historical church and it is very active on the weekends. It is located in the heart of the Zocalo square and it is very picturesque!",
          "Large space with many artifacts. Splendid valuable metals and art work. We were there after dark would be more pleasing during the day",
          "As part of a city tour we stopped in the town square (Zocalo) of the older part of Acapulco. The Cathedral (La Catedral) was built the in the early 1900's and has a little different architecture for a church in Mexico. Well worth the time to stop and stroll around.",
          "Although, I do not speak or understand the beautiful Spanish language, myself and 2 friends decided we wanted to attend a church on Sunday. So we went to this one, our driver translated afterwards the gist of the message. I loved that this is a local community church it is",
          "We have visited hundreds of Catholic cathedrals in every continent, but none so...., so..., strange. It's not even a big church..., more like a mid size chapel. Disappointedly dirty outside and the surrounding area. Worth a quick stop though...",

          "The best part of visiting the Acapulco Cathedral is the walk through the Zocalo(town square). Stop and enjoy the street vendors. It is all safe.",
          "Lovely seeing the church - still in use - there were baptisms going on the day we passed by. The market in front of the church is worth a look around - felt quite touristy but interesting with some great food and drinks available.",

          "Iv'e seen a lot of Churches in Eastern Europe and this one from the 17th century was SPECTACULAR!!! A MUST SEE!! Jan Carona knew all of the history, which was so great!! otherwise we would have had a lot of unswered ??",
          "I have always felt a calming effect when I walk into a church, no matter the Denomination. This one is sort of the exception since outside there is always activities going on and baloons for sale, and souvenirs for sale. Having said that, I love this building.",

        "wiki": "Fun in Acapulco is a 1963 American musical comedy film starring Elvis Presley and Ursula Andress.\nThe film featured the Top 10 Billboard hit \"Bossa Nova Baby\" and reached No. 1 on the national weekly box office charts a week after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. The film would be Presley's last release before the arrival of Beatlemania. It was the top-grossing movie musical of 1963.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nMike Windgren works on a boat in Acapulco, Mexico. When Janie Harkins, the bratty daughter of the boat owner, gets him fired, Mike must find new work. A Mexican boy named Raoul helps him get a job as a lifeguard and singer at a local hotel. Clashes abound when Mike runs into a rival lifeguard, who is the champion diver of Mexico. He is angry at Mike for taking some of his hours, and for stealing his woman.\nMike is recovering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a fear of heights, following a tragic high-wire accident during his career as a circus performer. However, after Mike sees the lifeguard perform a number of dangerous dives, including flips and head-first dives into a section of the pool surrounded by a ring of fire, he decides to get even with him and eventually sets himself up to perform a death-defying dive off the 136-foot cliffs of La Quebrada in front of hundreds of people. Mike dives off the cliff, and successfully lands in the water, earning the lifeguard's respect.\nAs the crowd and the lifeguard applaud, Mike performs one more song and leaves with Margarita and Raoul.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nElvis Presley as Mike Windgren\nUrsula Andress as Margarita Dauphin\nElsa C\u00e1rdenas as Dolores Gomez\nPaul Lukas as Maximilian Dauphin\nLarry Domasin as Raoul Almeido\nAlejandro Rey as Moreno\nRobert Carricart as Jose Garcia\nTeri Hope as Janie Harkins\nGenaro Gomez as Bullfighter\nRed West as Poolside Guest\nTeri Garr was a credited extra.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nExterior filming in Acapulco took place in January 1963. A stunt double was used for Presley, whose own shots were later completed in March at the Paramount studios in Los Angeles. Presley was unable to travel to Mexico as he had been declared \"persona non grata\" by local authorities following two violent riots at the trendy 'Las Americas' cinema in Mexico City, during the openings of his previous films King Creole (El barrio contra mi)  in 1959,   and G.I. Blues (Cafe Europa) in 1961.\nIn fact, the ban had actually  started in 1957, when Excelsior, Mexico's foremost  newspaper published an article by gossip columnist Federico de Leon that falsely stated Presley had been interviewed while visiting Tijuana, a place Presley never visited, before or after, where he had allegedly said that \"he would not care to go sing in Mexico, as he found it a distasteful country and that he would in fact prefer to kiss three African Americans than a single Mexican woman.\" This led to a split in attitudes towards Presley among Mexican youth which became physically violent on several occasions. The King Creole riots saw 100 people jailed, but by the time of Fun in Acapulco's release, Presley's records  had been banned from airplay, in 1957, his records publicly burnt in the El Zocalo town square that same year, and as stated above, his ban from stores enforced, since  1959.\nDecades later, it came to light that the false Presley quotes were the work of Ernesto Peralta Uruchurtu, a powerful politician and the Regent of Mexico City.  Uruchurtu allegedly sent a blank cheque to Presley's Los Angeles offices in early 1957 in return for Presley's appearance at the 15th birthday bash of the daughter of a powerful media mogul on whose behalf he was acting. The invitation was not agreed upon, and the check was returned, despite the fact that the mogul had already began to boast publicly that Presley would appear at his daughter's birthday party.  The story in \"Excelsior\"   was then planted both as a form of revenge, and as a way of explaining why he did not come to Mexico to sing. These incidents were documented by Parm\u00e9nides Garc\u00eda Salda\u00f1a in his book \"Rey Criollo\", and in Eric Zoloy's book Elvis Refried: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHoward Thompson of The New York Times wrote in a positive review that \"this attractive travel poster for the famed Mexican resort is far and away [Presley's] best musical feature to date. It's a pleasant, idyllic movie that never takes itself seriously and moves briskly under Richard Thorpe's direction ... And Mr. Presley has never seemed so relaxed and personable.\" A middling review in Variety said, \"Presley fans won't be disappointed\u2014he sings ten serviceable songs and wiggles a bit to boot. However, the ground covered by the plot doesn't help to increase his star stature and, for those who are not devotees, the main attraction may only turn out to be the Technicolorful scenery of Acapulco.\" John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Presley buffs should eat it up ... Director Richard Thorpe has kept the film's pace swift, which helps to cover up a lack of character development and a routine plot.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin declared, \"There is a distinct falling away here from the charm, humour and liveliness of some recent Elvis Presley films, notably Follow That Dream ...\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1963\n\n\n== References ==\n\n2.

        "wiki": "Diego Mar\u00eda de la Concepci\u00f3n Juan Nepomuceno Estanislao de la Rivera y Barrientos Acosta y Rodr\u00edguez, known as Diego Rivera (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8dje\u0263o ri\u02c8\u03b2e\u027ea]; December 8, 1886 \u2013 November 24, 1957), was a prominent Mexican painter. His large frescoes helped establish the mural movement in Mexican and international art. \nBetween 1922 and 1953, Rivera painted murals in, among other places, Mexico City, Chapingo, and Cuernavaca, Mexico; and San Francisco, Detroit, and New York City, United States. In 1931, a retrospective exhibition of his works was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York; this was before he completed his 27-mural series known as Detroit Industry Murals. \nRivera had numerous marriages and children, including at least one natural daughter. His first child and only son died at the age of two. His fourth wife was fellow Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, with whom he had a volatile relationship that continued until her death. He was married a fifth time, to his agent.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nRivera was born as one of twin boys in Guanajuato, Mexico, to Mar\u00eda del Pilar Barrientos and Diego Rivera Acosta, a well-to-do couple. His twin brother Carlos died two years after they were born. They were said to have Converso ancestry (Spanish ancestors who were forced to convert from Judaism to Catholicism in the 15th and 16th centuries). Rivera wrote in 1935: \"My Jewishness is the dominant element in my life.\"Rivera began drawing at the age of three, a year after his twin brother died. When he was caught drawing on the walls of the house, his parents installed chalkboards and canvas on the walls to encourage him. \n\n\n=== Marriages and families ===\nAfter moving to Paris, Rivera met Angelina Beloff, an artist from the pre-Revolutionary Russian Empire. They married in 1911, and had a son, Diego (1916\u20131918), who died young. During this time, Rivera also had a relationship with painter Maria Vorobieff-Stebelska, who gave birth to a daughter named Marika Rivera in 1918 or 1919.Rivera divorced Beloff and married Guadalupe Mar\u00edn as his second wife in June 1922, after having returned to Mexico. They had two daughters together: Ruth and Guadalupe. \nHe was still married when he met art student Frida Kahlo in Mexico. They began a passionate affair and, after he divorced Marin, Rivera married Kahlo on August 21, 1929. He was 42 and she was 22. Their mutual infidelities and his violent temper resulted in divorce in 1939, but they remarried December 8, 1940 in San Francisco, California. \nA year after Kahlo's death, on July 29, 1955, Rivera married Emma Hurtado, his agent since 1946. \n\n\n=== Personal beliefs ===\nRivera was an atheist. His mural Dreams of a Sunday in the Alameda depicted Ignacio Ram\u00edrez holding a sign which read, \"God does not exist\". This work caused a furor, but Rivera refused to remove the inscription. The painting was not shown for nine years \u2013 until Rivera agreed to remove the inscription. He stated: \"To affirm 'God does not exist', I do not have to hide behind Don Ignacio Ram\u00edrez; I am an atheist and I consider religions to be a form of collective neurosis.\"\n\n\n=== Art education and circle ===\nFrom the age of ten, Rivera studied art at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. He was sponsored to continue study in Europe by Teodoro A. Dehesa M\u00e9ndez, the governor of the State of Veracruz. After arriving in Europe in 1907, Rivera first went to Madrid, Spain to study with Eduardo Chicharro.\nFrom there he went to Paris, France, a destination for young European and American artists and writers, who settled in inexpensive flats in Montparnasse. His circle frequented La Ruche, where his Italian friend Amedeo Modigliani painted his portrait in 1914. His circle of close friends included Ilya Ehrenburg, Chaim Soutine, Modigliani and his wife Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, Max Jacob, gallery owner L\u00e9opold Zborowski, and Moise Kisling. Rivera's former lover Marie Vorobieff-Stebelska (Marevna) honored the circle in her painting Homage to Friends from Montparnasse (1962).In those years, some prominent young painters were experimenting with an art form that would later be known as Cubism, a movement led by Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Gris. From 1913 to 1917, Rivera enthusiastically embraced this new art style. Around 1917, inspired by Paul C\u00e9zanne's paintings, Rivera shifted toward Post-Impressionism, using simple forms and large patches of vivid colors. His paintings began to attract attention, and he was able to display them at several exhibitions.\nRivera claimed in his autobiography that while in Mexico, in 1904 he had engaged in cannibalism, particularly enjoying the taste of brains. This claim has been considered factually suspect, or elaborate lies. He wrote in his autobiography: \"I believe that when man evolves a civilization higher than the mechanized but still primitive one he has now, the eating of human flesh will be sanctioned. For then man will have thrown off all of his superstitions and irrational taboos.\"In his later years Rivera lived in the United States and Mexico. He died on November 24, 1957.\n\n\n== Career in Mexico ==\n\nIn 1920, urged by Alberto J. Pani, the Mexican ambassador to France, Rivera left France and traveled through Italy studying its art, including Renaissance frescoes. After Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos became Minister of Education, Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921 to become involved in the government sponsored Mexican mural program planned by Vasconcelos. See also Mexican muralism. The program included such Mexican artists as Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Rufino Tamayo, and the French artist Jean Charlot. In January 1922, he painted \u2013 experimentally in encaustic \u2013 his first significant mural Creation in the Bol\u00edvar Auditorium of the National Preparatory School in Mexico City while guarding himself with a pistol against right-wing students.\n\nIn the autumn of 1922, Rivera participated in the founding of the Revolutionary Union of Technical Workers, Painters and Sculptors, and later that year he joined the Mexican Communist Party (including its Central Committee). His murals, subsequently painted in fresco only, dealt with Mexican society and reflected the country's 1910 Revolution. Rivera developed his own native style based on large, simplified figures and bold colors with an Aztec influence clearly present in murals at the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico City begun in September 1922, intended to consist of one hundred and twenty-four frescoes, and finished in 1928.\n\nRivera's art work, in a fashion similar to the steles of the Maya, tells stories. The mural En el Arsenal (In the Arsenal) shows on the right-hand side Tina Modotti holding an ammunition belt and facing Julio Antonio Mella, in a light hat, and Vittorio Vidali behind in a black hat. However, the En el Arsenal detail shown does not include the right-hand side described nor any of the three individuals mentioned; instead it shows the left-hand side with Frida Kahlo handing out munitions. Leon Trotsky lived with Rivera and Kahlo for several months while exiled in Mexico. Some of Rivera's most famous murals are featured at the National School of Agriculture  (Chapingo Autonomous University of Agriculture) at Chapingo near Texcoco (1925\u201327), in the Cort\u00e9s Palace in Cuernavaca (1929\u201330), and the National Palace in Mexico City (1929\u201330, 1935).Rivera painted murals in the main hall and corridor at the Chapingo Autonomous University of Agriculture (UACh). He also painted a fresco mural titled Tierra Fecundada (Fertile Land in English) in the university's chapel between 1923 and 1927. Fertile Land depicts the revolutionary struggles of Mexico's peasant (farmers) and working classes (industry) in part through the depiction of hammer and sickle joined by a star in the soffit of the chapel. In the mural, a \"propagandist\" points to another hammer and sickle. The mural features a woman with an ear of corn in each hand, which art critic Antonio Rodriguez describes as evocative of the Aztec goddess of maize in his book Canto a la Tierra: Los murales de Diego Rivera en la Capilla de Chapingo.\nThe corpses of revolutionary heroes Emiliano Zapata and Otilio Montano are shown in graves, their bodies fertilizing the maize field above. A sunflower in the center of the scene \"glorifies those who died for an ideal and are reborn, transfigured, into the fertile cornfield of the nation,\" writes Rodrigues. The mural also depicts Rivera's wife Guadalupe Marin as a fertile nude goddess and their daughter Guadalupe Rivera y Marin as a cherub.The mural was slightly damaged in an earthquake, but has since been repaired and touched up, remaining in pristine form.\n\n\n== Later years ==\n\nIn the autumn of 1927, Rivera went to Moscow, Soviet Union, having accepted a government invitation to take part in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. The following year, while still in the Soviet Union, he met American Alfred H. Barr, Jr., who would soon become Rivera's friend and patron. Barr was the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Although commissioned to paint a mural for the Red Army Club in Moscow, in 1928 Rivera was ordered by authorities to leave the country because of alleged involvement in anti-Soviet politics, so he returned to Mexico. \nIn 1929, following the assassination of former president \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n the previous year, the government suppressed the Mexican Communist Party. That year Rivera was expelled from the party because of his suspected Trotskyite sympathies. In addition, observers noted that his 1928 mural In the Arsenal includes the figures of communists Tina Modotti, Cuban Julio Antonio Mella, and Italian Vittorio Vidali. After Mella was murdered in January 1929, allegedly by Stalinist assassin Vidali, Rivera was accused of having had advance knowledge of a planned attack.  \nAfter divorcing his third wife, Guadalupe (Lupe) Marin, Rivera married the much younger Frida Kahlo in August 1929. They had met when she was a student, and she was 22 years old when they married; Rivera was 42. \nAlso in 1929, American journalist Ernestine Evans's book The Frescoes of Diego Rivera, was published in New York City; it was the first English-language book on the artist. In December, Rivera accepted a commission from the American Ambassador to Mexico to paint murals in the Palace of Cort\u00e9s in Cuernavaca, where the US had a consulate.In September 1930, Rivera accepted a commission by architect Timothy L. Pfluegerfor two works related to his design projects in San Francisco. Rivera and Kahlo went to the city in November. Rivera painted a mural for the City Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange for US$2,500. He also completed a fresco for the California School of Fine Art, a work that was later relocated to what is now the Diego Rivera Gallery at the San Francisco Art Institute.During this period, Rivera and Kahlo worked and lived at the studio of Ralph Stackpole, who had recommended Rivera to Pflueger. Rivera met Helen Wills Moody, a notable American tennis player, who modeled for his City Club mural.In November 1931, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a retrospective exhibition of Rivera's work; Kahlo attended with him.Between 1932 and 1933, Rivera completed a major commission: twenty-seven fresco panels, entitled Detroit Industry, on the walls of an inner court at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Part of the cost was paid by Edsel Ford, scion of the entrepreneur.\nDuring the McCarthyism of the 1950s, a large sign was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as \"detestable.\"His mural Man at the Crossroads, originally a three-paneled work, begun as a commission for John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1933 for the Rockefeller Center in New York City, was later removed. Because it included a portrait of Vladimir Lenin, former leader of the Soviet Union and Marxist pro-worker content, Rockefeller's son, the press, and some of the public protested. Anti-Communism ran high in some American circles, although many others in this period of the Great Depression had been drawn to the movement as offering hope to labor. \nWhen Diego refused to remove Lenin from the painting, he was ordered to leave the US. One of Diego's assistants managed to take a few photographs of the work so Diego was able to later recreate it. American poet Archibald MacLeish wrote six \"irony-laden\" poems about the mural. The New Yorker magazine published E. B. White's light poem, \"I paint what I see: A ballad of artistic integrity\", also in response to the controversy with number of sponsors taking offense to it.As a result of the negative publicity, officials in Chicago cancelled their commission for Rivera to paint a mural for the Chicago World's Fair. Rivera issued a press statement, saying that he would use the remaining money from his commission at Rockefeller Center to repaint the same mural, over and over, wherever he was asked, until the money ran out. He had been paid in full although the mural was reportedly destroyed. There have been rumors that the mural was covered over rather than removed and destroyed, but this has not been confirmed.\nIn December 1933, Rivera returned to Mexico. He repainted Man at the Crossroads in 1934 in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, calling this version Man, Controller of the Universe. \n\nOn June 5, 1940, invited again by Pflueger, Rivera returned for the last time to the United States to paint a ten-panel mural for the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. His work Pan American Unity was completed November 29, 1940. Rivera painted in front of attendees at the Exposition, which had already opened. He received US$1,000 per month and US$1,000 for travel expenses. \nThe mural includes representations of two of Pflueger's architectural works, and portraits of Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, woodcarver Dudley C. Carter, and actress Paulette Goddard. She is shown holding Rivera's hand as they plant a white tree together. Rivera's assistants on the mural included Thelma Johnson Streat, a pioneer African-American artist, dancer, and textile designer. The mural and its archives are now held by City College of San Francisco.\n\n\n=== Membership in AMORC ===\nIn 1926, Rivera became a member of AMORC, the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, an occult organization founded by American occultist Harvey Spencer Lewis. In 1926, Rivera was among the founders of AMORC's Mexico City lodge, called Quetzalcoatl after an ancient indigenous god. He painted an image of Quetzalcoatl for the local temple.In 1954 Rivera tried to be readmitted into the Mexican Communist Party. He had been expelled in part because of his support of Trotsky, who had been exiled and assassinated years before in Mexico. Rivera was required to justify his AMORC activities. At the time, the Mexican Communist Party excluded persons involved in Freemasonry, and regarded AMORC as suspiciously similar to Freemasonry. Rivera told his questioners that, by joining AMORC, he wanted to infiltrate a typical \u201cYankee\u201d organization on behalf of Communism. However, he also claimed that AMORC was \u201cessentially materialist, insofar as it only admits different states of energy and matter, and is based on ancient Egyptian occult knowledge from Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti.\u201d\n\n\n=== Representation in other media ===\nDiego Rivera has been portrayed in several films. He was played by Rub\u00e9n Blades in Cradle Will Rock (1999), by Alfred Molina in Frida (2002), and (in a brief appearance) by Jos\u00e9 Montini in Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015).\nBarbara Kingsolver's novel, The Lacuna features Rivera, Kahlo, and Leon Trotsky as major characters.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Murals ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, the other two members of \"Los Tres Grandes\"\nCrystal Cubism\nAnahuacalli Museum\nC\u00e1rcamo de Dolores\nGabriel Bracho, Venezuelan muralist\nElaine Hamilton-O'Neal\nMar\u00eda Izquierdo\nMexican art\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAguilar, Louis. \"Detroit was muse to legendary artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo\".

          "I'm all for modern, but Capilla de la Paz seemed somehow cold and impersonal to me. The best part was the trip up the mountainous route through the modern homes of the wealthy.",
          "Saw this online before we left for vacation. We went there and got engaged! It is a very peaceful and beautiful place. Atop Acapulco with a 360 view. Feeling close to God and at peace. This place has a sad but integrating history. The family that built it had the tragedy of",

          "The chapel itself was pleasant but unremarkable; the architect was important, and it looks kind of like a pineapple, but inside it is basically a lot of concrete. The grounds are pretty and well maintained. The cross is iconic, and it is kind of interesting to see up close.",

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr.

        "wiki": "Guerrero (Spanish pronunciation: [\u0261e\u02c8re\u027eo]), officially the Free and Sovereign State of Guerrero (Spanish: Estado Libre y Soberano de Guerrero), is one of the 32 states which comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided in 81 municipalities and its capital city is Chilpancingo and its largest city is Acapulco.\nIt is located in Southwestern Mexico. It is bordered by the states of Michoac\u00e1n to the north and west, the State of Mexico and Morelos to the north, Puebla to the northeast and Oaxaca to the east.\nThe state was named after Vicente Guerrero, one of the most prominent leaders in the Mexican War of Independence and the second President of Mexico. It is the only Mexican state named after a president. The modern entity did not exist until 1849, when it was carved out of territories from the states of Mexico, Puebla, and Michoac\u00e1n.\nIn addition to the capital city, the state's largest cities include Acapulco, Petatl\u00e1n, Ciudad Altamirano, Taxco, Iguala, Ixtapa, Zihuatanejo, and Santo Domingo. Today, it is home to a number of indigenous communities, including the Nahuas, Mixtecs and Amuzgos. It is also home to communities of Afro-Mexicans in the Costa Chica region.\nGeographically, the state is mountainous and rugged with flat areas limited to small mesas and the Pacific coastline. This coastline has been important economically for the area, first as the port of Acapulco in colonial and post-Independence area and today for the tourist destinations of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa. Tourism is the single most important economic factor of the state and Acapulco's tourism is important to the nation's economy as a whole. However, other sources of employment are scarce in the state, which has caused its ranking as number one in the emigration of workers to the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric and Pre-Columbian periods ===\n\nThe first humans in the state's territory were nomadic hunter-gatherers who left evidence of their existence in various caves starting about 20,000 years ago. Until about 8,000 years ago, climatic conditions better favored human habitation than those today; however, sedentary human habitation happened around this time in the mountainous areas with more moisture, and better soil for agriculture. After that, settlements appeared near the coast because of fishing. At these sites, evidence of weaving, ceramics, basketry and other crafts have been found. Around this time, a grain called teocintle, or the forerunner to corn, became the staple of the diet.There is debate as to whether the earliest civilizations here were Olmecs, who migrated to this region or native peoples who were heavily influenced by the Olmecs, especially in the Balsas River area. Olmec influences can be seen in cave paintings such as those found in Juxtlahuaca and well as stone tools and jade jewelry from the time period.Recent evidence indicates that ancient Guerrero cultures may have influenced the early development of the Olmecs.Eventually, the peoples of the Mexcala River area developed their own distinctive culture, called Mezcala or Mexcala. It is characterized by its own sculpture and ceramics, distinguished by its simplicity. Olmec influence remained with this culture, especially evident in the grouping of villages, construction of ceremonial centers and a government dominated by priests. Later, the culture assimilated aspects of the Teotihuacan model, which included the Mesoamerican ballgame .Later migrations to the area brought ethnicities such as the Pur\u00e9pecha, Mixtecs, Maya and Zapotecs who left traces on the local cultures as they established commercial centers around the seventh century. In the 8th century, Toltec influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and amate paper. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the Chichimecas, culminating in Aztec domination by the 15th century.In the 11th century, new migrations entered the area from the north, which included the Nahuas, who occupied what is now the center of the state, and the Pur\u00e9pecha who took over the west. The Nahuas established themselves in Zacatula, Atoyac de \u00c1lvarez and Tlacotepec, later conquering the areas occupied by the Chontal Maya and Matlatzincas.By the 15th century, the territory of modern Guerrero state was inhabited by a number of peoples, none of whom had major cities or population centers. The most important of these peoples where the Pur\u00e9pecha, Cuitlatecs, Ocuitecas and Matlatzincas in the Tierra Caliente, the Chontales, Mazatlecos and Tlahuicas in the Sierra del Norte, the Coixcas and Tepoztecos in the Central Valleys, the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs in the La Monta\u00f1a, the Jopis, Mixtecos and Amuzgos in Costa Chica and Tolimecas, Chubias, Pantecas and Cuitlecas in Costa Grande. Most of these lived in smaller dominions with moderate social stratification. One distinctive feature of the peoples of this was the use of cotton garments.The Aztecs began making incursions in the Guerrero area as early as 1414 under Chimalpopoca as part of the conquest of the Toluca Valley. Incursions into the Tierra Caliente came around 1433 under Itzcoatl who attacked the Cuitlatecos settled between the Teloloapan and Cocula Rivers. By 1440, the Aztec Empire controlled the north of the state, or the La Monta\u00f1a area. Attempts to take the Costa Chica area began in 1452 against the Yopis, which failed. Various battles would be fought between 1452 and 1511 before most of the rest of the state became Aztec tributary provinces. The modern state of Guerrero comprised seven Aztec provinces.\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\n\nDuring the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the last Aztec emperor, Cuauht\u00e9moc (who was the son of a Chontal princess and Ahuizotl), came from Ixcateopan de Cuauht\u00e9moc. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, there was little resistance by the peoples of the Guerrero area to the Spanish and a number of them, such as the Amuzgos, actively sided with the Europeans. In 1521, Rodrigo de Casta\u00f1eda entered the Taxco area, while Gonzalo de Sandoval marched on the Chontal region, the Sierra del Norte, the Iguala valley and later the Costa Chica. Juan Rodriguz de Villafuerte took the Costa Grande area.After the Spanish Conquest, the territory was part of the audencia or \"court of royal law for indigenous peoples\" called M\u00e9xico, which initially consisted of the lands of the former Aztec Empire, which was then diminished somewhat when it became a province of New Spain. The Guerrero area was attractive to the Spanish mostly for its coast. The first Spanish Pacific port was at Zihuatanejo, used for trade, fishing and pearls. Another important area for the Spanish was Taxco for its minerals. The lands were divided into 76 encomiendas given to the conquistadors to exploit and civilize the mines, farmlands, forest and native peoples. Evangelization efforts were undertaken by the Augustinians in the Central Valleys, La Monta\u00f1a and Tierra Caliente regions while the Franciscans took the northern areas, the Costa Grande and Acapulco.Much of the population decline occurred in the first half of the 16th century when diseases brought by the Europeans, as well as brutal exploitation, killed many natives. This was particularly true in the Costa Chica region, which would lead to the importation of African slaves to the area. During this time indigenous political bodies called \"pueblos\" or \"Indian Republics\" arose, which were local entities that represented the Indians of that area before Spanish authorities. They are credited with being one of the forerunners of the current municipality system in the state. At their height, there were 213 such pueblos in the Guerrero territory.During the colonial period, Acapulco became the main western port for New Spain, connecting this part of the Spanish empire to Asia. The Manila galleon came here each year, bringing silks and other merchandise from China, India and other Asian areas. Also on board were thousands of Asian slaves. These slaves and other Asian individuals that migrated of their own will during the colonial period form the basis of what is known as the \"cuarta ra\u00edz\" of Mexico.\nBy the second half of the 18th century, few indigenous people survived and exploitation of those that were left took on more varied forms in indentured servitude. Acapulco became the most important city in the area, and its mayor governed much of Guerrero's territory.  This territory then belonged into three intendencias or alcaldias\u2013Puebla, Mexico and Valladolid, regions managed by a superintendent intended to root out corruption\u2013and would remain so until the early Independence period.\n\n\n=== Independence and the later nineteenth century ===\n\nPeoples of the territory of Guerrero immediately supported the cause of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla which would culminate with the Independence of Mexico. During the first part of the Mexican War of Independence, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos fought on the side of Miguel Hidalgo in the southern part of Mexico, including the Acapulco area and the Costa Grande. However, the insurgents were never able to take the port. They were able to take control of territories in the center of the state. Morelos took Chilpancingo and set up the Congress of An\u00e1huac, which would publish the document \"Sentimentos de la Naci\u00f3n\" on 6 November 1813. The Congress of An\u00e1huac also approved the Act of Independence written by Carlos Mar\u00eda Bustamante. Later, the Mexican flag was designed and first sewn in Iguala, after Agust\u00edn de Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero joined forces under the Plan of Iguala to end the war in 1821.The first government of an independent Mexico divided the country into twelve departments. The territory of modern Guerrero state was divided among the departments of Mexico, Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n and Oaxaca. The 1824 Constitution made these entities states.In 1823, Nicol\u00e1s Bravo and Vicente Guerrero petitioned for the creation of a \"South State\" (Estado del Sur), encompassing the lands that Guerrero had military control over during the war, but without success. However, the federal government did recognize a military district centered on Chilpancingo which Guerrero headed until he became President of Mexico in 1824.Much of the country struggled between its liberal (federalist) and conservative (centralist) factions in the first half of the 19th century. In one of these battles, Vicente Guerrero was captured and executed in Oaxaca in 1831. With conservatives in charge, Nicolas Bravo proposed in 1836 a South Department with its capital in Chilpancingo, including the provinces of Acapulco, Chilapa, Tlapa and Taxco. In 1841, representatives from 42 communities in the area, called the \"amigos del sur,\" pushed to have a \"Acapulco Department\" created, but it was rejected by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.There were other political and military reorganizations in the area during the 1840s. In 1847, Nicolas Bravo and Juan \u00c1lvarez proposed creating a separate entity for the Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco areas, but the Mexican\u2013American War intervened. After the war, the states of Puebla, Mexico and Michoac\u00e1n were persuaded to cede territory for a new entity.\n\nIn 1849, President Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera decreed the establishment of the state of Guerrero, with Juan \u00c1lvarez as its first governor. Tixtla was declared the first capital. The state was created from the districts of Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco from the State of Mexico, Tlapa from Puebla and the municipality of Coyuca from the state of Michoac\u00e1n. The capital would later be moved to Chilpancingo in 1870.In this state, Juan \u00c1lvarez rebelled against the government of Ignacio Comonfort and declared the Plan of Ayutla in 1854. However, this rebellion was quelled by the federal government. More uprisings would ensue after the adoption of the 1857 Constitution. These uprisings were part of the ongoing struggle between liberals and conservatives in the country. The state of Guerrero was a mostly conservative area of the country and it opposed both the 1857 Constitution and the 1859 Reform Laws. Intense battle between liberal and conservative elements would continue through most of the rest of the 19th century.\n\nFor most of the period of President Porfirio D\u00edaz's regime (1876\u20131911), the state was in relative peace, electing nine governors, although only two of these were Guerrero natives. The economy became concentrated in the hands of a few landholders, military people and others. While the era was relatively prosperous, very little of this benefit reached the common people. Laws were passed and infrastructure in the state was created to benefit the major players of the economy. In addition, indigenous people were forced from the north to the south to work, such as the Kickapoos who were forced to work in the haciendas of the Costa Chica. Some of the first factories built in the state were constructed during this period. Acapulco was connected to Mexico City by rail in the 1890s. Despite the economic development, many people remained without work at the very end of the 19th century as mining and cotton farming waned.\n\n\n=== Mexican Revolution to the present ===\n\nSome of the first uprisings against Diaz occurred in the state. In 1873 in the La Monta\u00f1a region, Pascual Claudio pronounced the Plan de Xochihuahuetlan, with the backing of the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs of the state and pushed for the socialization of land. The revolt was put down one year later. In 1876, field workers in various regions rebelled against taxes, usurpation of lands and oppression against political prisoners. Another revolt occurred in 1887 in the Tlapa regions, led by Silverio Leon. In 1891, a movement led by Jos\u00e9 Cuevas has a messianic character to it and worked to bring down the Diaz government.  In this case, federal control over much of Guerrero was weakened. In the 1900s, a number of intellectuals, including Eusebio S. Almonte (great grandson of Morelos) rebelled politically against the state and federal governments. The revolt was put down by Victoriano Huerta.A number of other rebellions broke out in the state against the Diaz government until the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. From that point, many of the local rebels became affiliated with the Zapatistas.In 1911, after D\u00edaz resigned, the last of his supporting troops in Guerrero surrendered in Acapulco. Rebels loyal to Francisco I. Madero chose Francisco Figueroa as the governor and established Guerrero's capital in Acapulco. While Madero was initially popular in Guerrero, he soon lost standing for failure to return lands which were claimed by various indigenous and rural farm groups. From this point, the Zapatistas turned on the Madero government with the next phase of the revolution breaking out in Guerrero and other states. The Zapatistas soon had control of the central valley and strategic positions in the north of the state. When Victoriano Huerta took control of the country, the Zapatistas in Guerrero joined forces with those loyal to Venustiano Carranza, eventually controlling almost all of the state by 1914. During this time lands were redistributed. However, after Huerta resigned and Carranza assumed the presidency, the Zapatistas in Guerrero opposed him as well. Carranza offered the position of governor of Guerrero to Julian Blanco in 1915 but he was killed in an ambush a year later. From this point, there were battles between the Zapatistas and forces loyal to Carranza. This ended in 1919, when Emiliano Zapata died and his movement split.Various battles among the factions of the Mexican Revolution had skirmishes in the state until the war was finally over in 1920. The Zapatistas, although fragmented, were recognized as a political force in Guerrero with many Zapatistas receiving political and military positions. This included Rodolfo Neri as governor, who initiated the Agrarian Reform in 1921, organized workers\u2019 unions and made education mandatory.Although the Revolution was over, there were still factional struggles among unions, local strongmen, foreign interests and rural farm organizations over land, education and politics. These would flare up into localized armed rebellions such as the one led by Romulo Figueroa in 1923 and federal attempts to recuperate lands in 1927. In addition, battles related to the Cristero War were fought in Guerrero as well. There were a number of strikes and other political actions by unions in the 1930s. Government intervention brought better agricultural production techniques as well as new crops such as coconut groves, sesame seed and coffee. Some industries were introduced as well, especially in Iguala and Chilpancingo.  Most of these are related to food processing, mining and energy production.From the 1930s, to the present, the making of crafts and tourism have played a significant role in the economy. In Taxco, silver mining and silversmithing made a comeback due to the efforts of William Spratling. Tourism is mostly centered on the coastal communities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and the tourist resort of Ixtapa. Acapulco became the first major tourist attraction for the state in the 1950s, when Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher, Brigitte Bardot and others made it fashionable. During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel there.  Zihuatanejo, with the nearby resort area of Ixtapa, were developed by the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s to increase tourism to the area.In 2012, some teachers from rural areas, including Guerrero, opposed federal regulations which prevented them from automatic lifetime tenure, the ability to sell or will their jobs, and the teaching of either English or computer skills. In September 2014, the municipality of Iguala was the site of a mass kidnapping of 43 students that drew national and international attention.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe state is home to four indigenous ethnic groups, most of whom live in rugged, isolated mountain areas such as Ixcateopan, Santa Mar\u00eda Oapan, Ameyaltepec, Chilapa de \u00c1lvarez, Malinaltepec, Tlapa de Comonfort, Metlatonoc, Zapotitlan Tablas and Xochistlahuaca and Xilitla. Some of these groups include the Mixtecs, Nahuas, Amuzgos and Tlapanecos, and over 20 indigenous languages are spoken.  The most common languages are Nahuatl (38.9%), Mixteco (27%), Tlapaneco (21.9%) and Amuzgo 7.9%. Only 29% of those who speak an indigenous language also speak Spanish.One distinctive group in the state is the Amuzgo people, who are concentrated in the south, near the Oaxacan border in municipalities such as Xochistlahuaca. This group is known for its handwoven textiles done on backstrap looms with many pieces recognized by the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes. Cualac is noted for its machetes which have blades decorated by etching miniature landscapes. Temalacacingo and Acapetlahuaya produce gourd items, toys and small lacquered items. Olinal\u00e1 has been an important producer of lacquer since pre-Hispanic times.Another important group is the \u201cafromexicanos\u201d or Afro-Mexicans who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated from the rest of Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, there are many who have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being \u201cnegro\u201d is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is \u201cchilena\u201d which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, \u201cSoy negro de la Costa\u2026,\u201d has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico's cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with Pinotepa Nacional and Puerto Escondido, which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools.\n\n\n=== Major communities ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe state does not have a tradition of painting and other visual arts aside from amate paper work but, recently, there has been a movement to promote more classical oils and other works, with recent generations of painters from the state and galleries opening to promote their work. Some of these artists include Casiano Garc\u00eda, Ian Malaj, Leonel Maciel, Miguel \u00c1ngel Sotelo, Gerza\u00edn Vargas and Hugo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga.\nThe literary arts have a longer tradition, at least as far back as the 17th century. The best-known writer from the state hailed from Taxco, playwright Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n. He is considered to be one of the most notable writers from the Siglo de Oro of Spanish literature. Another notable writer from the state is Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, although he is better known for his role in the defeat of Emperor Maximilian I and as a politician than as a writer. Other writers from the state over the centuries include Celedonio Serrano, Herminio Ch\u00e1vez, Juan S\u00e1nchez Andraka and Andr\u00e9s Acosta.The state has a long history of folk music, which has been the basis of much of the state's modern compositions as well. Because of the different ethnicities, traditions and customs vary from region to region. In the coastal lowlands, music such as \u201cson\u201d is most often heard and dances such as jarabes.  The culture of the Costa Chica region of Guerrero is centered on the municipality of Tixtla. Dances performed here include the Arranca Zacete, Jarabes, Palomo or Chilena and the Fandango. Most of these are accompanied by bands playing wind instruments.  Another type of music which is endemic to the state is called \"calentana\", which comes from an area called the Tierra Caliente. Tixtleca music comes from the town of Tixtla in the center of the state. Guerrero's best known composer is Margarito Dami\u00e1n Vargas, who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was only 37 years old when he died, but he had written more than 200 musical works including \"Ondas del Pac\u00edfico,\" \"Me delirio,\" \"Adi\u00f3s a Acapulco,\" and \"Dolores,\" which have been performed by orchestras and popular singers. Other musicians include Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn Ram\u00edrez Altamirano, Zacar\u00edas Salmer\u00f3n Daza and Joan Sebastian.  As well, another singer from Guerrero, Aida Pierce, became better known as an actress and comedian.\nSome interesting regional customs in Guerrero include the burning of \u201cmalo\u201d (evil) on 29 September made with dried flowers. Afterward, protective crosses of fresh flowers are placed on doors of homes. Other customs are the singing of \u201cPapaquis\u201d instead of \u201cLas Ma\u00f1anitas\u201d in Tixtla, the weddings of the Costa Grande where guests pay for their own food, the tiger fight dance in Zitlala and Tixtla and eating pozole on Thursdays in Chilpancingo.Cuisine in the state is most strongly influenced by the indigenous, the Spanish and, to some extent, the French. Corn, chili pepper, beans and meat are indigenous ingredients. Indigenous preparations include the various moles (red, green, yellow and others), chalupas, totopos, atole, pozole and many other dishes. Spanish contributions include wheat, leavened bread (including \u201cchilpancingue\u00f1as\") and dairy products. French influence comes from the French occupation of the country in the 19th century as well as French monks who had been in the area of Chilapa earlier. Regional dishes include mole de jumil (made from a particular type of native beetle) in Taxco, bean tamales in Tepecuacuilco, quail dishes in Iguala and seafood \u201ccuatete\u201d in the Costa Chica area. A number of areas in the state produce mezcal and wine is made in the Huitzuco area. Pozole blanco is widely and traditionally consumed on Thursdays and Saturdays in the state.The state's ethnic groups are known for their unique musical styles as well as regional dances. The best known dance is the Danza de los Tlacoloteros. This originated in the Central Valleys region, and its theme is agriculture. The owners of \u201ctlacololes\u201d (cornfields) are called \u201ctlacololoeros.\u201d The basic premise is that these tlacololoeros chase away malevolent spirits from the crops, which are represented by naguals or fierce tigers. The dance has 15 characters. It is most often performed in places such as Chichuihualco, Taxco, Chilpancingo, Iguala and Atlixtac. Another dance that feature tigers is the Danza del Tecuano, where the animals stalk characters. This one is most often performed in Tuxpan, Ciudad Altamirano and Huitzuco. Other dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Diablos, the Danza de los Manueles, the Danza de los Gachupines, the Danza de los Siete Vicios, the Danza de los Pescados, the Danza de los Machos, the Danza de los Moros, the Danza de los Maizos, the Danza de los Zopilotes, the Danza de los Tejoneros and the Danza del Palomo de Guerrero.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Triangle of the Sun ===\n\nAlmost all of Guerrero's tourism is concentrated among the municipalities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco, which the state promotes as the \u201cTri\u00e1ngulo del Sol\u201d (Triangle of the Sun). Acapulco is by far the most important of the three. In 2008, the state attracted 272.8 million dollars of private investment into the tourism sector of the economy, with most of it invested in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa. In addition, federal tourism agencies invested another 180 million pesos that year, both for infrastructure and promotion. The State Department of the United States has issued travel advisories for the state, especially Acapulco, due to drug trafficking, but safety concerns have been dismissed by local authorities.Acapulco is one of Mexico's oldest and most well-known beach resorts, which came into prominence by the 1950s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco is still famous for its nightlife and still attracts many vacationers, although most are now from Mexico itself. Zihuatanejo is the fourth-largest city in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is northwest of Acapulco.  This town has been developed as a tourist attraction, paired along with the modern tourist resort of Ixtapa, 5 km away. However, Zihuatanejo keeps its traditional town feel.  Taxco was one of the primary mining areas during the colonial period. It has narrow winding streets with no sidewalks, due to being built in a narrow ridge on the side of a mountain. The town was declared a national monument by Mexico in 1990, with numerous historical buildings dating from the 17th to 19th centuries.\n\n\n=== Archeological sites ===\n\nMost of Guerrero's pre-Hispanic history is known through archeology. The state has 1,705 registered archeological sites, with seven officially open to the public. These include La Organera-Xochipala, Palma Sola, Teopantecuanitl\u00e1n and Cuetlajuchitl\u00e1n. La Organera-Xochipala is the best known of Guerrero's archeological sites because of its monumental architecture. The site has seven states of development with six patios, and thirty two structures. The site covers 1,600 m2 (17,000 sq ft) and is located in the community of Xochilapa in the municipality of Eduardo Neri or Zumpango del R\u00edo, which is a mountains and semi-arid region of the state. It was occupied from 650 CE to 1000 CE The tombs are the most notable constructions here and feature a number of Mayan \u201cfalse arches.\u201d .Palma Sola is a site on the south side of El Veladero in Acapulco. This site does not have any structure but rather it is important for 18 rocks with petrogylphs with images of humans, plants and animals. There are also figures which look to be calendar like and geographic in function.Teopantecuanitlan is the most important Olmec era site in Guerrero. Its calculated to extend over 160 hectares (400 acres) but the most important buildings cover 50,000 m2 (540,000 sq ft). It was discovered in 1983 as it was being sacked. It is estimated to have been inhabited from between 1000 and 500 BCE. It is located in the Valley of Copalillo where the Amacuzas and Mezcala (Balsas) Rivers converge. Cuetlajuchitlan was discovered accidentally during the construction of the Cuernavaca, Acapulco highway. To preserve the site, the Los Querendes Tunnel was built underneath it. It is calculated to extend 35 hectares (86 acres) but only 2 hectares (4.9 acres) have been explored. It was principally occupied between 200 BCE and 200 CE. It is identified as being with the Mezcala culture.  The site stands out as an early example of a planned city which extends from the intersection two main roads.Other, smaller sites include Ixcateopan, Los Tepoltzis and Huamuxtitlan. Pueblo Viejo is located on the side of the El Tamarindo mountain just west of the city of Iguala. This site has an extension of 901,145 m2 (9,699,840 sq ft) and is divided in two parts due to a ravine that runs through it. The exact number of structures here is not known because the site has not been fully explored. The site of Ixcateopan is located in the municipality of the same name. The explored site was a civic-religious center with a palace and an altar to Quetzalcoatl.  Los Tepoltzis is located outside the community of Tixtla and consists of a number of small sites including a ceremonial center thirty meters long, three meters high with stairways and a plaza. Huamuxtitl\u00e1n is in the municipality of the same name. While the site is covers significant territory only one pyramid has been uncovered. Most of the rest of the site consists of living quarters. Near this site are smaller sites along the Tlapaneco River.\n\n\n=== Outdoor activities ===\n\nThe state has a number of sites suitable for ecotourism, including mountains, caves, wild areas for the observation of flora and fauna, camping and areas that offer extreme sports. Many of the extreme sports are offered in the Acapulco area including high-speed water jets, kayaking, canoeing, river rafting, rock climbing, spelunking, paintball, mountain climbing, parasailing and more. Activities in other parts of the state include rafting on the Papagayo River, kayaking and canoeing in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, rock-climbing in Chilpancingo and Taxco, mountain climbing in Ixcateopan, rappelling in Zihuatanejo and bungee jumping and parasailing in Iguala.\nThere are a number of caves to explore such as Grutas Dos Arroyos in Dos Arroyos, various small caves in Pueblo Bravo and some in Acapulco.  The best known caves in the state are in the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa National Park. This park is home to the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa Caverns and Grutas de Carlos Pacheco. The first is a live cave with many rock formations still in progress. This has infrastructure for tourists and guided tours. The second set of caves is a dry cave with less infrastructure.\n\n\n== Handcrafts ==\n\nCrafts form an important part of the state's economy, providing all or part of many families\u2019 income. The state government passed the Ley de Fomento a la Cultural in 1988 which works to protect crafts produced within the state. One type of handcraft produced in the state is metalworking with most precious and non-precious metals. The best known work produced in the state is made with silver, centered in the town of Taxco. Each year this town holds the annual National Silver Fair (Feria Nacional de la Plata). Gold is worked in locations such as Iguala, Ciudad Altamirano, Coyuca de Catal\u00e1n, Arcelia and Ometepec. Steel machetes and other items are produced in Ayutla, Tixtla, Chilapa, Tecpan deGaleana and Ometepec. Gold leaf is done in Tlacotepec, Tlalchipa and Cuetzala del Progreso. Costume jewelry is made in Acatl\u00e1n, and Chilapa, producing buttons of various colors, pieces made of brass coated in nickel, glass and metal wire to produce items such as necklaces, bracelets, and more. Other jewelry is made by twisting and weaving fine strands of silver or gold wire. Silver is mostly done in Taxco, with gold pieces in Ciudad Altamirano.Wooden items are locally painted and coated with a high-gloss lacquer (laca). The best pieces of this type are made of a distinctively aromatic wood called lin\u00e1loe (from Bursera aloexylon). But due to lin\u00e1loe's relative scarcity, cheaper ones are made from pine and treated to smell like lin\u00e1loe. The making of lacquered items is centered in the municipality of Olinal\u00e1, but also in Temalcalcingo, Ocotepec and Acapetlahuaya.  Items made include small boxes, chests, trays, masks, frames, jewelry boxes.Pottery is a very traditional craft and is practices in many of the communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, water containers, pitchers, candle holders and some sculptured decorative items. Most of these items have been made the same way since the pre-Hispanic period. The best quality ware is considered to be made in the central valleys in municipalities such as Zacualpan, Nuitzalapa, Atzacualoya, and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing. Acatl\u00e1n makes ceramic toys, and Ometepec specializes in the making of very large c\u00e1ntaro jars, traditionally used for storage.\n\nClothing and textiles are mostly made by indigenous communities such as the Nahuas, Mixtecos and Amuzgos, who use weaving and embroidery patterns to distinguish themselves from one another. The most distinctive indigenous clothing item is the huipil although rebozos and other items are also made.. While much is made for local consumption, indigenous clothing can be found in tourist areas and other markets as well as tablecloths, napkins and other decorative pieces. Communities with reputation for their textiles include Tlacoachistlahuaca, Xochistlahuaca, Yolox\u00f3chilt (San Luis Acatl\u00e1n) and Acatl\u00e1n (Chilapa).Another craft, practiced mostly along the central and coastal areas, is that of palm frond weaving. With these fronds items like hats, bags, fans, mats, animal figures and more are made. A particular type of hat made in this fashion in Chilapa, Zitlala, Zapotitl\u00e1n Tablas and Ahuacoutzingo is called a \u201ccoste\u00f1o\u201d hat.Most handcrafted furniture is made in Taxco and Ixcatepoan, in which an aromatic cedar is found. Other furniture producing areas are Chilpancingo, Iguala, Teloloapan and Ciudad Altamirano. In addition to furniture, items such as masks and figures are carved from wood.One craft which is specific to the state is painting using traditional amate or bark paper as a canvas. This craft began in the 1970s in Xalitla, located between Iguala and Chilpancingo. Since that time, these paintings or drawings have become known both inside and outside of Mexico.  The best known works today come from the communities of Maxela, San Juan, Ahuelic\u00e1n and Ahuehuepan. Most of the themes of these paintings are related to agriculture, everyday life and religion.Leathercrafts is mostly limited to saddlemaking and other items relating to horseback riding. This is prominent in areas such as San Jer\u00f3nimo, Chilpancingo, Tixtla, Quechultenango and others. Other crafts include stone sculpting and the cutting of precious and semiprecious stones, buttons and other items for clothing and costume jewelry.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe state is divided into 81 municipalities and seven political regions. The largest municipality is Coahuayutla at 3,511.5 km2 and the most recently created one is Iliatenco in the La Monta\u00f1a region. The three best-known communities of the state are Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco. Angel Aguirre Rivero was governor of the state until October 27, 2014 with Rogelio Ortiz Martinez succeeding him after he resigned.\n\n\n== Geography, climate and nature ==\n\nThe state of Guerrero has a territory of 63,794 km2 (24,631 sq mi). The state borders the states of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.  Geographically, the state is divided into three regions: La Monta\u00f1a (mountains), Tierra Caliente (hot lands) of the northeast and La Costa (coast). La Monta\u00f1a is mostly forested and is concentrated in the north and east of the state. Tierra Caliente and is situated in the lowlands along the Balsas River. This area also extends into Michoac\u00e1n state and is called similarly. La Costa is divided into two subregions called Costa Chica and Costa Grande. The Costa Chica extends from Acapulco to the border with Oaxaca. Costa Grande extends west of Acapulco to the Balsas River. Much of the state's current agriculture and livestock raising concentrated in La Costa as it is relatively flat.Most of the state is covered in mountains of varying heights, with deep canyons with flat areas limited to small mesas and the coastline. Most of the mountains belong to the Sierra Madre del Sur. The exception is the mountains of the Taxco area which belong to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and include the small mountain ranges of the Sierra de Sultepec, Sierra de Zacualpan and the Sierra de Zultepec. These are connected to the same volcanic system as the Nevado de Toluca.The state's climate is dominated by the rainy tropical areas and rainy temperate areas. The former has high temperatures above 18 \u00b0C (64.4 \u00b0F) year round and experiences most rain in the summer and early fall.  Most of this is found near the coast under 2,000 m (6,562 ft) asl. In the higher elevations away from the coast in the Sierra Madre del Sur, the climate is temperate but also experiences the same pattern of rainfall. Most of the rain that falls in the state is produced from evaporation from the Pacific Ocean.The coast extends for about 500 km (311 mi) and includes features such as the Balsas River delta, Mongles Point, Ixtapa Point, Zihuatanejo Bay, Ixtapa Island, Acapulco Bay, Apies Island, Islas Blancas, San Gabriel Island, Islas Frailes Blancos or Rocas de Potosi, Punta Gorda, and others. There are a number of lagoons along the coast including the Laguna de Potosi in Morro de Petatl\u00e1n, Lagunas de Mitla, the Laguna de Nusco and the Laguna de Coyuca.\n\nThe Balsas River enters Guerrero from Puebla state where it is formed. Prior to reaching the town of Balsas, the river is called Mexcala, then Balsas to the ocean. The Nexapa River is a tributary of the upper portion of the Balsas. The Amacuzac River enters the state from the State of Mexico. It passes under the Grutas de Cacahuamilco, then reemerges to form part of the border between Guerrero and Morelos. The Tepecoacuilco or Huitzuco River forms within the state and is a tributary of the Balsas.  The Cocula or Iguala River forms in the Taxco area and is one of the major drainages of this region. Other rivers in the state include the Cuetzala, the Alohuixtla, the Cutzamala, the Tlapaneco Huamuxtitlan, the Milpilla or Zumpango, the R\u00edo del Oro, the Zayulapa, the Huautla and the R\u00edo Uni\u00f3n.The Middle America Trench lies in the Pacific Ocean, parallel to Guerrero's coast. This trench is a subduction zone, where the oceanic Cocos Plate is sliding under the continental North American Plate. Subduction zones can produce large earthquakes, like the 2012 Guerrero\u2013Oaxaca earthquake on March 20, 2012.\nFlora of the state is determined by altitude and climate. The higher mountain areas have forests of pine and oyamel fir, with amate, and other tropical trees found in the lower elevations. Tropical hardwoods are mostly found in the lower elevations near the coast. The state has a wide variety of wildlife from deer, small mammals, large numbers of birds and reptiles and insects.Five terrestrial ecoregions extend across the state. The Southern Pacific dry forests lie on the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly deciduous during the long dry season. The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic orchids, butterflies, and birds. The Balsas dry forests lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including jaguarundi, coati, ocelot, and collared peccary. The northernmost part of the state includes portions of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin. The Mexican South Pacific mangroves are found in coastal lagoons along the coast of Michoac\u00e1n, Guerrero, and Oaxaca.\nThe Parque Natural de Guerrero is a natural reserve located in the central valleys of the state, extending for about eighty kilometers squared. Most of the area is covered in pine and holm oak forests that covered the high altitude valleys of this region.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAgricultural production is mostly of staple crops such as corn, rice and beans along with tomatoes, tomatillos, okra, green chili peppers, chickpeas, soybeans, yams, and other vegetables. Commercial crops include coffee, hibiscus, sugar cane, sesame seed, peanuts and sorghum. A number of fruits are grown for both domestic consumption and market such as melons, papaya, watermelon, mangos, bananas, tamarind and citrus.Guerrero is the number one producer of poppy flower in Mexico. On a global scale, Guerrero shares the first place with Afghanistan. Mexico provides more than 90 percent of US's heroin. The poppy flower has become an economic support for many families in the \"Sierra de Guerrero\" (Guerrero mountain chain), since it is much more profitable than any other crop. Due to the high poverty rates, many peasants prefer to grow the poppy flower in order to cover their basic needs.\nThe state has large forests with logging potential, although most are ejido or other community property. Most of the loggable timber is pine.Fishing is an important industry for the state with livestock raised is limited due to poor pastures due to overgrazing. They include cattle, pigs, goats and sheep as well as some domestic fowl.  The long coast is important for fishing which support 55 fishing communities. The main fishing ports are Petacalco, Zihuatanejo, Acapulco, Barra de Tecoanapa and Puna Maldonado. Commercial fishing brings in shark, sailfish, sierra, sea bass, mojarra, lobster, shrimp, clams and many other species.The mountains in the interior of the state have mineral deposits, such as gold and lead as well as iron. The latter is found mostly along the Balsas River.Tourism is the most important sector of the state's commerce. Tourism in Guerrero is important to the overall Mexican economy as well. It is the main source of the state's economic development.The main employment generators of the state are service industry (28.2% of workers), commerce, restaurants and hotels (25.1%), financial services and real estate (13.4) and manufacturing (12.2%).However, due to the lack of employment and the general lack of education of many in Guerrero, the state ranks number one in the number of migrants that head to the United States to work. It is estimated that each year 73,000 head north to live permanently with another 128,000 who migrate each year during the dry season. It is also estimated what somewhere between one quarter and one third of Guerrero's population lives in the United States, with about 300,000 in the Chicago area alone. The phenomenon has left many villages with no men and women taking up most of the work such as farming, crafts and petty commerce.\n\n\n== Education ==\nUntil the 1970s, illiteracy was a major problem in Guerrero. However, the rate of illiteracy was down from 48% to 26.8% from 1970 to 1990.  Illiteracy still remains a problem with a 21.55% rate. The lowest levels are in Acapulco and Iguala with the highest in rural municipalities such as Metlatonoc (80.6%) and Tlacoachistlahuaca (73.3%). However, the literacy rate for those between 6 and 14 year of age is 80%.From pre-school through high school, the state has 9,559 schools, staffed by 44,239 teachers. The state university is the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guerrero, which was initially founded as the Instituto Literario de \u00c1lvarez in 1852 in Acapulco. It was transferred to Chilpancingo when that city was made the capital in 1870. The institution was reorganized a number of times with the most modern structure taking shape in 1960, when the institution was named the Universidad de Guerrero. The current name was granted in 1963 when it became autonomous from direct state control.There is also education in the native Amuzgo Guerrero language.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Media ===\nGuerrero has a number of radio stations, one television channel, which broadcasts from the capital, with the rest satellite TV. Newspapers of Guerrero include: Diario 17, Diario 21, El Sol de Acapulco, El Sur, Peri\u00f3dico de Guerrero, La Jornada Guerrero, Novedades de Acapulco, and Pueblo Guerrero .\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nThere are international airports in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo as well as private airstrips.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCarrizalillo, Guerrero\nVallecitos de Zaragoza\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFigueroa Alcocer, Jes\u00fas (1982).

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (14 September 1769 \u2013 6 May 1859) was a Prussian polymath, geographer, naturalist, explorer, and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science. He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography. Humboldt's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring.Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas, exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view. His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years. Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). \nHumboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise, Kosmos, in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture. This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity. He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change, in 1800 and again in 1831, based on observations generated during his travels.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nAlexander von Humboldt was born in Berlin in Prussia on 14 September 1769. He was baptized as a baby in the Lutheran faith, with the Duke of Brunswick serving as godfather.Humboldt's father, Alexander Georg von Humboldt, belonged to a prominent Pomeranian family. Although not one of the titled gentry, he was a major in the Prussian Army, who had served with the Duke of Brunswick. At age 42, Alexander Georg was rewarded for his services in the Seven Years' War with the post of royal chamberlain. He profited from the contract to lease state lotteries and tobacco sales. He first married the daughter of Prussian General Adjutant Schweder. In 1766, Alexander Georg married Maria Elisabeth Colomb, a well-educated woman and widow of Baron Hollwede, with whom she had a son. Alexander Georg and Maria Elisabeth had three children, a daughter, who died young, and then two sons, Wilhelm and Alexander. Her first-born son, Wilhelm and Alexander's half-brother, was something of a ne'er do well, not often mentioned in the family history.Alexander Georg died in 1779, leaving the brothers Humboldt in the care of their emotionally distant mother. She had high ambitions for Alexander and his older brother Wilhelm, hiring excellent tutors, who were Enlightenment thinkers, including Kantian physician Marcus Herz and botanist Karl Ludwig Willdenow, who became one of the most important botanists in Germany. Humboldt's mother expected them to become civil servants of the Prussian state. The money Baron Holwede left to Alexander's mother became, after her death, instrumental in funding Alexander's explorations, contributing more than 70% of his private income.\n\nDue to his youthful penchant for collecting and labeling plants, shells, and insects, Alexander received the playful title of \"the little apothecary\". Marked for a political career, Alexander studied finance for six months in 1787 at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), which his mother might have chosen less for its academic excellence than its closeness to their home in Berlin. On 25 April 1789, he matriculated at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, then known for the lectures of C. G. Heyne and anatomist J. F. Blumenbach. His brother Wilhelm was already a student at G\u00f6ttingen, but they did not interact much, since their intellectual interests were quite different. His vast and varied interests were by this time fully developed.At G\u00f6ttingen, he met Georg Forster, a naturalist who had been with Captain James Cook on his second voyage. Humboldt traveled with Forster in Europe. The two traveled to England, Humboldt's first sea voyage, the Netherlands, and France. In England, he met Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, who had traveled with Captain Cook; Banks showed Humboldt his huge herbarium, with specimens of the South Sea tropics. The scientific friendship between Banks and Humboldt lasted until Banks's death in 1820, and the two shared botanical specimens for study. Banks also mobilized his scientific contacts in later years to aid Humboldt's work.Humboldt's scientific excursion up the Rhine resulted in his 1790 treatise Mineralogische Beobachtungen \u00fcber einige Basalte am Rhein (Brunswick, 1790) (Mineralogic Observations on Several Basalts on the River Rhine).\nHumboldt's passion for travel was of long standing. Humboldt's talents were devoted to the purpose of preparing himself as a scientific explorer. With this emphasis, he studied commerce and foreign languages at Hamburg, geology at Freiberg School of Mines in 1791 under A.G. Werner, leader of the Neptunist school of geology; from anatomy at Jena under J.C. Loder; and astronomy and the use of scientific instruments under F.X. von Zach and J.G. K\u00f6hler. At Freiberg, he met a number of men who were to prove important to him in his later career, including Spaniard Manuel del Rio, who became director of the School of Mines the crown established in Mexico; Christian Leopold von Buch, who became a regional geologist; and, most importantly, Karl Freiesleben, who became Humboldt's tutor and close friend. During this period, his brother Wilhelm married, but Alexander did not attend the nuptials.\n\n\n== Travels and work in Europe ==\nHumboldt graduated from the Freiberg School of Mines in 1792 and was appointed to a Prussian government position in the Department of Mines as an inspector in Bayreuth and the Fichtel mountains. Humboldt was excellent at his job, with production of gold ore in his first year outstripping the previous eight years. During his period as a mine inspector, Humboldt demonstrated his deep concern for the men laboring in the mines. He opened a free school for miners, paid for out of his own pocket, which became an unchartered government training school for labor. He also sought to establish an emergency relief fund for miners, aiding them following accidents.Humboldt's researches into the vegetation of the mines of Freiberg led to the publication in Latin (1793) of his Florae Fribergensis, accedunt Aphorismi ex Doctrina, Physiologiae Chemicae Plantarum, which was a compendium of his botanical researches. That publication brought him to the attention of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had met Humboldt at the family home when Alexander was a boy, but Goethe was now interested in meeting the young scientist to discuss metamorphism of plants. An introduction was arranged by Humboldt's brother, who lived in the university town of Jena, not far from Goethe. Goethe had developed his own extensive theories on comparative anatomy. Working before Darwin, he believed that animals had an internal force, an urform, that gave them a basic shape and then they were further adapted to their environment by an external force. Humboldt urged him to publish his theories. Together, the two discussed and expanded these ideas. Goethe and Humboldt soon became close friends.\nHumboldt often returned to Jena in the years that followed. Goethe remarked about Humboldt to friends that he had never met anyone so versatile. Humboldt's drive served as an inspiration for Goethe. In 1797, Humboldt returned to Jena for three months. During this time, Goethe moved from his residence in Weimar to reside in Jena. Together, Humboldt and Goethe attended university lectures on anatomy and conducted their own experiments. One experiment involved hooking up a frog leg to various metals. They found no effect until the moisture of Humboldt's breath triggered a reaction that caused the frog leg to leap off the table. Humboldt described this as one of his favorite experiments because it was as if he were \"breathing life into\" the leg.During this visit, a thunderstorm killed a farmer and his wife. Humboldt obtained their corpses and analyzed them in the anatomy tower of the university.\n\nIn 1794, Humboldt was admitted to the famous group of intellectuals and cultural leaders of Weimar Classicism. Goethe and Schiller were the key figures at the time. Humboldt contributed (7 June 1795) to Schiller's new periodical, Die Horen, a philosophical allegory entitled Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius.In 1792 and 1797, Humboldt was in Vienna; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions.Neither brother attended the funeral of their mother on 19 November 1796. Humboldt had not hidden his aversion to his mother, with one correspondent writing of him after her death, \"her death... must be particularly welcomed by you\". After severing his official connections, he awaited an opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished dream of travel.\nHumboldt was able to spend more time on writing up his research. He had used his own body for experimentation on muscular irritability, recently discovered by Luigi Galvani and published his results, Versuche \u00fcber die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser(Berlin, 1797) (Experiments on Stimulated Muscle and Nerve Fibres), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.\n\n\n== Spanish American expedition, 1799\u20131804 ==\n\n\n=== Seeking a foreign expedition ===\nWith the financial resources to finance his scientific travels, he sought a ship on a major expedition. Meantime, he went to Paris, where his brother Wilhelm was now living. Paris was a great center of scientific learning and his brother and sister-in-law Caroline were well connected in those circles. Louis-Antoine de Bougainville urged Humboldt to accompany him on a major expedition, likely to last five years, but the French revolutionary Directoire placed Nicolas Baudin at the head of it rather than the aging scientific traveler. On the postponement of Captain Baudin's proposed voyage of circumnavigation due to continuing warfare in Europe, which Humboldt had been officially invited to accompany, Humboldt was deeply disappointed. He had already selected scientific instruments for his voyage. He did, however, have a stroke of luck with meeting Aim\u00e9 Bonpland, the botanist and physician for the voyage. \nDiscouraged, the two left Paris for Marseilles, where they hoped to join Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt, but North Africans were in revolt against the French invasion in Egypt and French authorities refused permission to travel. Humboldt and Bonpland eventually found their way to Madrid, where their luck changed spectacularly.\n\n\n=== Spanish royal authorization, 1799 ===\n\nIn Madrid, Humboldt sought authorization to travel to Spain's realms in the Americas; he was aided in obtaining it by the German representative of Saxony at the royal Bourbon court. Baron Forell had an interest in mineralogy and science endeavors and was inclined to help Humboldt. At that time, the Bourbon Reforms sought to reform administration of the realms and revitalize their economies. At the same time, the Spanish Enlightenment was in florescence. For Humboldt \"the confluent effect of the Bourbon revolution in government and the Spanish Enlightenment had created ideal conditions for his venture\".The Bourbon monarchy had already authorized and funded expeditions, with the Botanical Expedition to the Viceroyalty of Peru to Chile and Peru (1777\u201388), New Granada (1783\u20131816), New Spain (Mexico) (1787\u20131803), and the Malaspina Expedition (1789\u201394). These were lengthy, state-sponsored enterprises to gather information about plants and animals from the Spanish realms, assess economic possibilities, and provide plants and seeds for the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid (founded 1755). These expeditions took naturalists and artists, who created visual images as well as careful written observations as well as collecting seeds and plants themselves. Crown officials as early as 1779 issued and systematically distributed Instructions concerning the most secure and economic means to transport live plants by land and sea from the most distant countries, with illustrations, including one for the crates to transport seeds and plants.When Humboldt requested authorization from the crown to travel to Spanish America, most importantly, with his own financing, it was given positive response. Spain under the Habsburg monarchy had guarded its realms against foreigner travelers and intruders. The Bourbon monarch was open to Humboldt's proposal. Spanish Foreign Minister Don Mariano Luis de Urquijo received the formal proposal and Humboldt was presented to the monarch in March 1799. Humboldt was granted access to crown officials and written documentation on Spain's empire. With Humboldt's experience working for the absolutist Prussian monarchy as a government mining official, Humboldt had both the academic training and experience of working well within a bureaucratic structure.\n\nBefore leaving Madrid in 1799, Humboldt and Bonpland visited the Natural History Museum, which held results of Mart\u00edn de Sess\u00e9 y Lacasta and Jos\u00e9 Mariano Moci\u00f1o's botanical expedition to New Spain. Humboldt and Bonpland met Hip\u00f3lito Ruiz L\u00f3pez and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pav\u00f3n y Jim\u00e9nez of the royal expedition to Peru and Chile in person in Madrid and examined their botanical collections.\n\n\n=== Venezuela, 1799\u20131800 ===\n\nArmed with authorization from the King of Spain, Humboldt and Bonpland made haste to sail, taking the ship Pizarro from A Coru\u00f1a, on 5 June 1799. The ship stopped six days on the island of Tenerife, where Humboldt climbed the volcano Teide, and then sailed on to the New World, landing at Cuman\u00e1, Venezuela, on 16 July.\nThe ship's destination was not originally Cuman\u00e1, but an outbreak of typhoid on board meant that the captain changed course from Havana to land in northern South America. Humboldt had not mapped out a specific plan of exploration, so that the change did not upend a fixed itinerary. He later wrote that the diversion to Venezuela made possible his explorations along the Orinoco River to the border of Portuguese Brazil. With the diversion, the Pizarro encountered two large dugout canoes each carrying 18 Guayaqui Indians. The Pizarro's captain accepted the offer of one of them to serve as pilot. Humboldt hired this Indian, named Carlos del Pino, as a guide.Venezuela from the 16th to the 18th centuries was a relative backwater compared to the seats of the Spanish viceroyalties based in New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, but during the Bourbon reforms, the northern portion of Spanish South America was reorganized administratively, with the 1777 establishment of a captaincy-general based at Caracas. A great deal of information on the new jurisdiction had already been compiled by Fran\u00e7ois de Pons, but was not published until 1806.Rather than describe the administrative center of Caracas, Humboldt started his researches with the valley of Aragua, where export crops of sugar, coffee, cacao, and cotton were cultivated. Cacao plantations were the most profitable, as world demand for chocolate rose. It is here that Humboldt is said to have developed his idea of human-induced climate change. Investigating evidence of a rapid fall in the water level of valley's Lake Valencia, Humboldt credited the desiccation to the clearance of tree cover and to the inability of the exposed soils in retain water. With their clear cutting of trees, the agriculturalists were removing the woodland's \"threefold\" moderating influence upon temperature: cooling shade, evaporation and radiation.Humboldt visited the mission at Caripe and explored the Gu\u00e1charo cavern, where he found the oilbird, which he was to make known to science as Steatornis caripensis. Also described the Guanoco asphalt lake as \"The spring of the good priest\" (\"Quelle des guten Priesters\"). Returning to Cuman\u00e1, Humboldt observed, on the night of 11\u201312 November, a remarkable meteor shower (the Leonids). He proceeded with Bonpland to Caracas where he climbed the Avila mount with the young poet Andr\u00e9s Bello, the former tutor of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who later became the leader of independence in northern South America. Humboldt met the Venezuelan Bol\u00edvar himself in 1804 in Paris and spent time with him in Rome. The documentary record does not support the supposition that Humboldt inspired Bol\u00edvar to participate in the struggle for independence, but it does indicate Bol\u00edvar's admiration for Humboldt's production of new knowledge on Spanish America.In February 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland left the coast with the purpose of exploring the course of the Orinoco River and its tributaries. This trip, which lasted four months and covered 1,725 miles (2,776 km) of wild and largely uninhabited country, had an aim of establishing the existence of the Casiquiare canal (a communication between the water systems of the rivers Orinoco and Amazon). Although, unbeknownst to Humboldt, this existence had been established decades before, his expedition had the important results of determining the exact position of the bifurcation, and documenting the life of several native tribes such as the Maipures and their extinct rivals the Atures (several words of the latter tribe were transferred to Humboldt by one parrot). Around 19 March 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland discovered dangerous electric eels, whose shock could kill a man. To catch them, locals suggested they drive wild horses into the river, which brought the eels out from the river mud, and resulted in a violent confrontation of eels and horses, some of which died. Humboldt and Bonpland captured and dissected some eels, which retained their ability to shock; both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations. The encounter made Humboldt think more deeply about electricity and magnetism, typical of his ability to extrapolate from an observation to more general principles. Humboldt returned to the incident in several of his later writings, including his travelogue Personal Narrative (1814\u201329), Views of Nature (1807), and Aspects of Nature (1849).Two months later, they explored the territory of the Maypures and that of the then-recently extinct Atur\u00e8s Indians. Humboldt laid to rest the persistent myth of Walter Raleigh's Lake Parime by proposing that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah had been misidentified as a lake.\n\n\n=== Cuba, 1800, 1804 ===\n\nOn 24 November 1800, the two friends set sail for Cuba, landing on 19 December, where they met fellow botanist and plant collector John Fraser. Fraser and his son had been shipwrecked off the Cuban coast, and did not have a license to be in the Spanish Indies. Humboldt, who was already in Cuba, interceded with crown officials in Havana, as well as giving them money and clothing. Fraser obtained permission to remain in Cuba and explore. Humboldt entrusted Fraser with taking two cases of Humboldt and Bonpland's botanical specimens to England when he returned, for eventual conveyance to the German botanist Willdenow in Berlin. Humboldt and Bonpland stayed in Cuba until 5 March 1801, when they left for the mainland of northern South America again, arriving there on 30 March.\nHumboldt is considered to be the \"second discoverer of Cuba\" due to the scientific and social research he conducted on this Spanish colony. During an initial three-month stay at Havana, his first tasks were to properly survey that city and the nearby towns of Guanabacoa, Regla, and Bejucal. He befriended Cuban landowner and thinker Francisco de Arango y Parre\u00f1o; together they visited the Guines area in south Havana, the valleys of Matanzas Province, and the Valley of the Sugar Mills in Trinidad. Those three areas were, at the time, the first frontier of sugar production in the island. During those trips, Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba's population, production, technology and trade, and with Arango, made suggestions for enhancing them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with proper leadership in the future.\nOn their way back to Europe from Mexico on their way to the United States, Humboldt and Bonpland stopped again in Cuba, leaving from the port of Veracruz and arriving in Cuba on 7 January 1804, staying until 29 April 1804. In Cuba, he collected plant material and made extensive notes. During this time, he socialized with his scientific and landowner friends, conducted mineralogical surveys, and finished his vast collection of the island's flora and fauna that he eventually published as Essai politique sur l'\u00eesle de Cuba.\n\n\n=== The Andes, 1801\u20131803 ===\n\nAfter their first stay in Cuba of three months, they returned to the mainland at Cartagena de Indias (now in Colombia), a major center of trade in northern South America. Ascending the swollen stream of the Magdalena River to Honda, they arrived in Bogot\u00e1 on 6 July 1801, where they met the Spanish botanist Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis, head of the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada, staying there until 8 September 1801. Mutis was generous with his time and gave Humboldt access to the huge pictorial record he had compiled since 1783. Mutis was based in Bogot\u00e1, but as with other Spanish expeditions, he had access to local knowledge and a workshop of artists, who created highly accurate and detailed images. This type of careful recording meant that even if specimens were not available to study at a distance, \"because the images traveled, the botanists did not have to\". Humboldt was astounded at Mutis's accomplishment; when Humboldt published his first volume on botany, he dedicated it to Mutis \"as a simply mark of our admiration and acknowledgement\".\n\nHumboldt had hopes of connecting with the French sailing expedition of Baudin, now finally underway, so Bonpland and Humboldt hurried to Ecuador. They crossed the frozen ridges of the Cordillera Real, they reached Quito on 6 January 1802, after a tedious and difficult journey.\nTheir stay in Ecuador was marked by the ascent of Pichincha and their climb of Chimborazo, where Humboldt and his party reached an altitude of 19,286 feet (5,878 m). This was a world record at the time, but 1000 feet short of the summit. Humboldt's journey concluded with an expedition to the sources of the Amazon en route for Lima, Peru.At Callao, the main port for Peru, Humboldt observed the transit of Mercury on 9 November and studied the fertilizing properties of guano, rich in nitrogen, the subsequent introduction of which into Europe was due mainly to his writings.\n\n\n=== New Spain (Mexico), 1803\u20131804 ===\n\nHumboldt and Bonpland had not intended to go to New Spain, but when they were unable to join a voyage to the Pacific, they left the Ecuadorian port of Guayaquil and headed for Acapulco on Mexico's west coast. Even before Humboldt and Bonpland started on their way to New Spain's capital on Mexico's central plateau, Humboldt realized the captain of the vessel that brought them to Acapulco had reckoned its location incorrectly. Since Acapulco was the main west-coast port and the terminus of the Asian trade from the Spanish Philippines, having accurate maps of its location was extremely important. Humboldt set up his instruments, surveying the deep-water bay of Acapulco, to determine its longitude.Humboldt and Bonpland landed in Acapulco on 15 February 1803, and from there they went to Taxco, a silver-mining town in modern Guerrero. In April 1803, he visited Cuernavaca, Morelos. Impressed by its climate, he nicknamed the city the City of Eternal Spring. Humboldt and Bonpland arrived in Mexico City, having been officially welcomed via a letter from the king's representative in New Spain, Viceroy Don Jos\u00e9 de Iturrigaray. Humboldt was also given a special passport to travel throughout New Spain and letters of introduction to intendants, the highest officials in New Spain's administrative districts (intendancies). This official aid to Humboldt allowed him to have access to crown records, mines, landed estates, canals, and Mexican antiquities from the prehispanic era. Humboldt read the writings of Bishop-elect of the important diocese of Michoacan Manuel Abad y Queipo, a classical liberal, that were directed to the crown for the improvement of New Spain.They spent the year in the viceroyalty, traveling to different Mexican cities in the central plateau and the northern mining region. The first journey was from Acapulco to Mexico City, through what is now the Mexican state of Guerrero. The route was suitable only for mule train, and all along the way, Humboldt took measurements of elevation. When he left Mexico a year later in 1804, from the east coast port of Veracruz, he took a similar set of measures, which resulted in a chart in the Political Essay, the physical plan of Mexico with the dangers of the road from Acapulco to Mexico City, and from Mexico City to Veracruz. This visual depiction of elevation was part of Humboldt's general insistence that the data he collected be presented in a way more easily understood than statistical charts. A great deal of his success in gaining a more general readership for his works was his understanding that \"anything that has to do with extent or quantity can be represented geometrically. Statistical projections [charts and graphs], which speak to the senses without tiring the intellect have the advantage of bringing attention to a large number of important facts\".Humboldt was impressed with Mexico City, which at the time was the largest city in the Americas, and one that could be counted as modern. He declared \"no city of the new continent, without even excepting those of the United States, can display such great and solid scientific establishments as the capital of Mexico\". He pointed to the Royal College of Mines, the Royal Botanical Garden and the Royal Academy of San Carlos as exemplars of a metropolitan capital in touch with the latest developments on the continent and insisting on its modernity. He also recognized important creole savants in Mexico, including Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Alzate y Ram\u00edrez, who died in 1799, just before Humboldt's visit; Miguel Vel\u00e1squez de Le\u00f3n; and Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama.Humboldt spent time at the Valenciana silver mine in Guanajuato, central New Spain, at the time the most important in the Spanish empire. The bicentennial of his visit in Guanajuato was celebrated with a conference at the University of Guanajuato, with Mexican academics highlighting various aspects of his impact on the city. Humboldt could have simply examined the geology of the fabulously rich mine, but he took the opportunity to study the entire mining complex as well as analyze mining statistics of its output. His report on silver mining is a major contribution, and considered the strongest and best informed section of his Political Essay. Although Humboldt was himself a trained geologist and mining inspector, he drew on mining experts in Mexico. One was Fausto Elhuyar, then head of the General Mining Court in Mexico City, who, like Humboldt was trained in Freiberg. Another was Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo, director of Royal College of Mines, whom Humboldt knew when they were both students in Freiberg. The Bourbon monarchs had established the mining court and the college to elevate mining as a profession, since revenues from silver constituted the crown's largest source of income. Humboldt also consulted other German mining experts, who were already in Mexico. While Humboldt was a welcome foreign scientist and mining expert, the Spanish crown had established fertile ground for Humboldt's investigations into mining.\nSpanish America's ancient civilizations were a source of interest for Humboldt, who included images of Mexican manuscripts (or codices) and Inca ruins in his richly illustrated Vues des cordill\u00e8res et monuments des peuples indig\u00e8nes de l'Amerique (1810\u20131813), the most experimental of Humboldt's publications, since it does not have \"a single ordering principle\" but his opinions and contentions based on observation. For Humboldt, a key question was the influence of climate on the development of these civilizations. When he published his Vues des cordill\u00e8res, he included a color image of the Aztec calendar stone, which had been discovered buried in the main plaza of Mexico City in 1790, along with select drawings of the Dresden codex and others he sought out later in European collections. His aim was to muster evidence that these pictorial and sculptural images could allow the reconstruction of prehispanic history. He sought out Mexican experts in the interpretation of sources from there, especially Antonio Pichardo, who was the literary executor of Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama's work. For American-born Spaniards (creoles) who were seeking sources of pride in Mexico's ancient past, Humboldt's recognition of these ancient works and dissemination in his publications was a boon. He read the work of exiled Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero, which celebrated Mexico's prehispanic civilization, and which Humboldt invoked to counter the pejorative assertions about the new world by Buffon, de Pauw, and Raynal. Humboldt ultimately viewed both the prehispanic realms of Mexico and Peru as despotic and barbaric. However, he also drew attention to indigenous monuments and artifacts as cultural productions that had \"both ... historical and artistic significance\".One of his most widely read publications resulting from his travels and investigations in Spanish America was the Essai politique sur le royaum de la Nouvelle Espagne, quickly translated to English as Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain (1811). This treatise was the result of Humboldt's own investigations as well as the generosity of Spanish colonial officials for statistical data.\n\n\n=== The United States, 1804 ===\n\nLeaving from Cuba, Humboldt decided to take an unplanned short visit to the United States. Knowing that the current U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, was himself a scientist, Humboldt wrote to him saying that he would be in the United States. Jefferson warmly replied, inviting him to visit the White House in the nation's new capital. In his letter Humboldt had gained Jefferson's interest by mentioning that he had discovered mammoth teeth near the Equator. Jefferson had previously written that he believed mammoths had never lived so far south. Humboldt had also hinted at his knowledge of New Spain.Arriving in Philadelphia, which was a center of learning in the U.S., Humboldt met with some of the major scientific figures of the era, including chemist and anatomist Caspar Wistar, who pushed for compulsory smallpox vaccination, and botanist Benjamin Smith Barton, as well as physician Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, who wished to hear about cinchona bark from a South American tree, which cured fevers. Humboldt later published a treatise in English on cinchona.After arriving in Washington D.C, Humboldt held numerous intense discussions with Jefferson on both scientific matters and also his year-long stay in New Spain. Jefferson had only recently concluded the Louisiana Purchase, which now placed New Spain on the southwest border of the United States. The Spanish minister in Washington, D.C. had declined to furnish the U.S. government with information about Spanish territories, and access to the territories was strictly controlled. Humboldt was able to supply Jefferson with the latest information on the population, trade agriculture and military of New Spain. This information would later be the basis for his Essay on the Political Kingdom of New Spain (1810). \nJefferson was unsure of where the border of the newly-purchased Louisiana was precisely, and Humboldt wrote him a two-page report on the matter. Jefferson would later refer to Humboldt as \"the most scientific man of the age\". Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, said of Humboldt \"I was delighted and swallowed more information of various kinds in less than two hours than I had for two years past in all I had read or heard.\" Gallatin, in turn, supplied Humboldt with information he sought on the United States.After six weeks, Humboldt set sail for Europe from the mouth of the Delaware and landed at Bordeaux on 3 August 1804.\n\n\n=== Travel diaries ===\nHumboldt kept a detailed diary of his sojourn to Spanish America, running some 4,000 pages, which he drew on directly for his multiple publications following the expedition. The leather-bound diaries themselves are now in Germany, having been returned from Russia to East Germany, where they were taken by the Red Army after World War II. Following German reunification, the diaries were returned to a descendant of Humboldt. For a time, there was concern about their being sold, but that was averted. A government-funded project to digitize the Spanish American expedition as well as his later Russian expedition has been undertaken (2014\u20132017) by the University of Potsdam and the German State Library\u2014Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.\n\n\n=== Achievements of the Latin American expedition ===\n\nHumboldt's decades' long endeavor to publish the results of this expedition not only resulted in multiple volumes, but also made his international reputation in scientific circles. Humboldt came to be well-known with the reading public as well, with popular, densely illustrated, condensed versions of his work in multiple languages. Bonpland, his fellow scientist and collaborator on the expedition, collected botanical specimens and preserved them, but unlike Humboldt who had a passion to publish, Bonpland had to be prodded to do the formal descriptions. Many scientific travelers and explorers produced huge visual records, which remained unseen by the general public until the late nineteenth century, in the case of the Malaspina Expedition, and even the late twentieth century, when Mutis's botanical, some 12,000 drawings from New Granada, was published. Humboldt, by contrast, published immediately and continuously, using and ultimately exhausting his personal fortune, to produce both scientific and popular texts. Humboldt's name and fame were made by his travels to Spanish America, particularly his publication of the Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain. His image as the premier European scientist was a later development.For the Bourbon crown, which had authorized the expedition, the returns were not only tremendous in terms of sheer volume of data on their New World realms, but in dispelling the vague and pejorative assessments of the New World by Guillaume-Thomas Raynal, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and William Robertson. The achievements of the Bourbon regime, especially in New Spain, were evident in the precise data Humboldt systematized and published.This memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of physical geography, plant geography, and meteorology. Key to that was Humboldt's meticulous and systematic measurement of phenomena with the most advanced instruments then available. He closely observed plant and animal species in situ, not just in isolation, noting all elements in relation to one other. He collected specimens of plants and animals, dividing the growing collection so that if a portion was lost, other parts might survive.\n\nHumboldt saw the need for an approach to science that could account for the harmony of nature among the diversity of the physical world. For Humboldt, \"the unity of nature\" meant that it was the interrelation of all physical sciences\u2014such as the conjoining between biology, meteorology and geology\u2014that determined where specific plants grew. He found these relationships by unraveling myriad, painstakingly collected data, data extensive enough that it became an enduring foundation upon which others could base their work. Humboldt viewed nature holistically, and tried to explain natural phenomena without the appeal to religious dogma. He believed in the central importance of observation, and as a consequence had amassed a vast array of the most sophisticated scientific instruments then available. Each had its own velvet lined box and was the most accurate and portable of its time; nothing quantifiable escaped measurement. According to Humboldt, everything should be measured with the finest and most modern instruments and sophisticated techniques available, for that collected data was the basis of all scientific understanding.\nThis quantitative methodology would become known as Humboldtian science. Humboldt wrote \"Nature herself is sublimely eloquent. The stars as they sparkle in firmament fill us with delight and ecstasy, and yet they all move in orbit marked out with mathematical precision.\"\n\nHis Essay on the Geography of Plants (published first in French and then German, both in 1807) was based on the then novel idea of studying the distribution of organic life as affected by varying physical conditions. This was most famously depicted in his published cross-section of Chimborazo, approximately two feet by three feet (54 cm x 84 cm) color pictorial, he called Ein Naturgem\u00e4lde der Anden and what is also called the Chimborazo Map. It was a fold-out at the back of the publication. Humboldt first sketched the map when he was in South America, which included written descriptions on either side of the cross-section of Chimborazo. These detailed the information on temperature, altitude, humidity, atmosphere pressure, and the animal and plants (with their scientific names) found at each elevation. Plants from the same genus appear at different elevations. The depiction is on an east-west axis going from the Pacific coast lowlands to the Andean range of which Chimborazo was a part, and the eastern Amazonian basin. Humboldt showed the three zones of coast, mountains, and Amazonia, based on his own observations, but he also drew on existing Spanish sources, particularly Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n, which he explicitly referred to. The Spanish American scientist Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas had also measured and observed mountain environments and had earlier come to similar ideas about environmental factors in the distribution of life forms. Humboldt was thus not putting forward something entirely new, but it is argued that his finding is not derivative either. The Chimborazo map displayed complex information in an accessible fashion. The map was the basis for comparison with other major peaks. \"The Naturgem\u00e4lde showed for the first time that nature was a global force with corresponding climate zones across continents.\" Another assessment of the map is that it \"marked the beginning of a new era of environmental science, not only of mountain ecology but also of global-scale biogeophysical patterns and processes.\"\n\nBy his delineation (in 1817) of isothermal lines, he at once suggested the idea and devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries. He first investigated the rate of decrease in mean temperature with the increase in elevation above sea level, and afforded, by his inquiries regarding the origin of tropical storms, the earliest clue to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes. This was a major contribution to climatology.His discovery of the decrease in intensity of Earth's magnetic field from the poles to the equator was communicated to the Paris Institute in a memoir read by him on 7 December 1804. Its importance was attested by the speedy emergence of rival claims.His services to geology were based on his attentive study of the volcanoes of the Andes and Mexico, which he observed and sketched, climbed, and measured with a variety of instruments. By climbing Chimborazo, he established an altitude record which became the basis for measurement of other volcanoes in the Andes and the Himalayas. As with other aspects of his investigations, he developed methods to show his synthesized results visually, using the graphic method of geologic-cross sections. He showed that volcanoes fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the igneous origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as Neptunism.Humboldt was a significant contributor to cartography, creating maps, particularly of New Spain, that became the template for later mapmakers in Mexico. His careful recording of latitude and longitude led to accurate maps of Mexico, the port of Acapulco, the port of Veracruz, and the Valley of Mexico, and a map showing trade patterns among continents. His maps also included schematic information on geography, converting areas of administrative districts (intendancies) using proportional squares. The U.S. was keen to see his maps and statistics on New Spain, since they had implication for territorial claims following the Louisiana Purchase. Later in life, Humboldt published three volumes (1836\u201339) examining sources that dealt with the early voyages to the Americas, pursuing his interest in nautical astronomy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His research yielded the origin of the name \"America\", put on a map of the Americas by Martin Waldseem\u00fcller.\n\nHumboldt conducted a census of the indigenous and European inhabitants in New Spain, publishing a schematized drawing of racial types and populations distribution, grouping them by region and social characteristics. He estimated the population to be six million individuals. He estimated Indians to be forty percent of New Spain's population, but their distribution being uneven; the most dense were in the center and south of Mexico, the least dense in the north. He presented these data in chart form, for easier understanding. He also surveyed the non-Indian population, categorized as Whites (Spaniards), Negroes, and castes (castas). American-born Spaniards, so-called creoles had been painting depictions of mixed-race family groupings in the eighteenth century, showing father of one racial category, mother of another, and the offspring in a third category in hierarchical order, so racial hierarchy was an essential way elites viewed Mexican society. Humboldt reported that American-born Spaniards were legally racial equals of those born in Spain, but the crown policy since the Bourbons took the Spanish throne privileged those born in Iberia. Humboldt observed that \"the most miserable European, without education and without intellectual cultivation, thinks himself superior to whites born in the new continent\". The truth in this assertion, and the conclusions derived from them, have been often disputed as superficial, or politically motivated, by some authors, considering that between 40% and 60% of high offices in the new world were held by creoles.\nThe enmity between some creoles and the peninsular-born whites increasingly became an issue in the late period of Spanish rule, with creoles increasingly alienated from the crown. Humboldt's assessment was that royal government abuses and the example of a new model of rule in the United States were eroding the unity of whites in New Spain. Humboldt's writings on race in New Spain were shaped by the memorials of the classical liberal, enlightened Bishop-elect of Michoac\u00e1n, Manuel Abad y Queipo, who personally presented Humboldt with his printed memorials to the Spanish crown critiquing social and economic conditions and his recommendations for eliminating them.One scholar says that his writings contain fantastical descriptions of America, while leaving out its inhabitants, stating that Humboldt, coming from the Romantic school of thought, believed '... nature is perfect till man deforms it with care'. The further assessment is that he largely neglected the human societies amidst nature. Views of indigenous peoples as 'savage' or 'unimportant' leaves them out of the historical picture. Other scholars counter that Humboldt dedicated large parts of his work to describing the conditions of slaves, indigenous peoples, mixed-race castas, and society in general. He often showed his disgust for the slavery and inhumane conditions in which indigenous peoples and others were treated and he often criticized Spanish colonial policies.Humboldt was not primarily an artist, but he could draw well, allowing him to record a visual record of particular places and their natural environment. Many of his drawings became the basis for illustrations of his many scientific and general publications. Artists whom Humboldt influenced, such as Johann Moritz Rugendas, followed in his path and painted the same places Humboldt had visited and recorded, such as the basalt formations in Mexico, which was an illustration in his Vues des Cordill\u00e8res.The editing and publication of the encyclopedic mass of scientific, political and archaeological material that had been collected by him during his absence from Europe was now Humboldt's most urgent desire. After a short trip to Italy with Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac for the purpose of investigating the law of magnetic declination and a stay of two and a half years in Berlin, in the spring of 1808, he settled in Paris. His purpose for being located there was to secure the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press. This colossal task, which he at first hoped would occupy but two years, eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then it remained incomplete.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Scholarly and public recognition ==\n\nDuring his lifetime Humboldt became one of the most famous men in Europe. Academies, both native and foreign, were eager to elect him to their membership, the first being The American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, which he visited at the tail end of his travel through the Americas. He was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1805.Over the years other learned societies in the U.S. elected him a member, including the American Antiquarian Society (Worcester, MA) in 1816; the Linnean Society of London in 1818; the New York Historical Society in 1820; a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.; the American Ethnological Society (New York) in 1843; and the American Geographical and Statistical Society, (New York) in 1856. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810. The Royal Society, whose president Sir Joseph Banks had aided Humboldt as a young man, now welcomed him as a foreign member.After Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government recognized him with high honors for his services to the nation. In 1827, the first President of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria granted Humboldt Mexican citizenship and in 1859, the President of Mexico, Benito Ju\u00e1rez, named Humboldt a hero of the nation (benem\u00e9rito de la naci\u00f3n). The gestures were purely honorary; he never returned to the Americas following his expedition.\nImportantly for Humboldt's long-term financial stability, King Frederick William III of Prussia conferred upon him the honor of the post of royal chamberlain, without at the time exacting the duties. The appointment had a pension of 2,500 thalers, afterwards doubled. This official stipend became his main source of income in later years when he exhausted his fortune on the publications of his research. Financial necessity forced his permanent relocation to Berlin in 1827 from Paris. In Paris he found not only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the salons and as the savant of the Institut de France and the observatory.\nOn 12 May 1827 he settled permanently in Berlin, where his first efforts were directed towards the furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. In 1827, he began giving public lectures in Berlin, which became the basis for his last major publication, Kosmos (1845\u201362).For many years, it had been one of his favorite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of \"magnetic storms\" (a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of Earth's magnetism). The meeting at Berlin, on 18 September 1828, of a newly formed scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the opportunity of setting on foot an extensive system of research in combination with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian government, in 1829, led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations across northern Asia. Meanwhile, his letter to the Duke of Sussex, then (April 1836) president of the Royal Society, secured for the undertaking, the wide basis of the British dominions.\nThe Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, observes, \"Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized\". However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the 18th-century observations of the transits of Venus.\nIn 1869, the 100th year of his birth, Humboldt's fame was so great that cities all over America celebrated his birth with large festivals. In New York City, a bust of his head was unveiled in Central Park.Scholars have speculated about the reasons for Humboldt's declining renown among the public. Sandra Nichols has argued that there are three reasons for this. First, a trend towards specialization in scholarship. Humboldt was a generalist who connected many disciplines in his work. Today, academics have become more and more focused on narrow fields of work. Humboldt combined ecology, geography and even social sciences. Second, a change in writing style. Humboldt's works, which were considered essential to a library in 1869, had flowery prose that fell out of fashion. One critic said they had a \"laborious picturesqueness\". Humboldt himself said that, \"If I only knew how to describe adequately how and what I felt, I might, after this long journey of mine, really be able to give happiness to people. The disjointed life I lead makes me hardly certain of my way of writing\". Third, a rising anti-German sentiment in the late 1800s and the early 1900s due to heavy German immigration to the United States and later World War 1. On the eve of the 1959 hundredth anniversary of the death of Humboldt, the government of West Germany planned significant celebrations in conjunction with nations that Humboldt visited.\n\n\n== Expedition in Russia, 1829 ==\n\nIn 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by Czar Nicolas I's Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed. It was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveler in the interests of science.\nThe Russian Foreign Minister, Count Georg von Cancrin contacted Humboldt about whether a platinum-based currency was possible in Russia and invited him to visit the Ural Mountains. Humboldt was not encouraging about a platinum-based currency, when silver was the standard as a world currency. But the invitation to visit the Urals was intriguing, especially since Humboldt had long dreamed of going to Asia. He had wanted to travel to India and made considerable efforts to persuade the British East India Company to authorize a trip, but those efforts were fruitless.When Russia renewed its earlier invitation to Humboldt, Humboldt accepted. The Russians sought to entice Humboldt by engaging his enduring interest in mining sites, for comparative scientific purposes for Humboldt, but for the Russians to gain expert knowledge about their resources. For Humboldt, the Russian monarch's promise to fund the trip was extremely important, since Humboldt's inherited 100,000 thaler fortune was gone and he lived on the Prussian government pension of 2,500\u20133,000 thalers as the monarch's chamberlain. The Russian government gave an advance of 1200 chervontsev in Berlin and another 20,000 when he arrived in St. Petersburg.Humboldt was eager to travel not just to the Urals, but also across the steppes of Siberia to Russia's border with China. Humboldt wrote Cancrin saying that he intended to learn Russian to read mining journals in the language. As the details of the expedition were worked out, Humboldt said that he would travel to Russia in his own French coach, with a German servant, as well as Gustav Rose, a professor of chemistry and mineralogy. He also invited Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg to join the expedition, to study water micro-organisms in Lake Baikal and the Caspian Sea. Humboldt himself was keen to continue his studies of magnetism of mountains and mineral deposits. As was usual for his research, he brought scientific instruments to take the most accurate measurements. The Russians organized the local arrangements, including lodging, horses, accompanying crew. Humboldt's title for the expedition was as an official of the Department of Mines. As the expedition neared dangerous areas, he had to travel in a convoy with an escort.Physically Humboldt was in good condition, despite his advancing years, writing to Cancrin \"I still walk very lightly on foot, nine to ten hours without resting, despite my age and my white hair\".Between May and November 1829 he and the growing expedition traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the Neva to the Yenisei, accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of 9,614 miles (15,472 km). Humboldt and the expedition party traveled by coach on well maintained roads, with rapid progress being made because of changes of horses at way stations. The party had grown, with Johann Seifert, who was a huntsman and collector of animal specimens; a Russian mining official; Count Adolphe Polier, one of Humboldt's friends from Paris; a cook; plus a contingent of Cossacks for security. Three carriages were filled with people, supplies, and scientific instruments. For Humboldt's magnetic readings to be accurate, they carried an iron-free tent. This expedition was unlike his Spanish American travels with Bonpland, with the two alone and sometimes accompanied by local guides.\nThe Russian government was interested in Humboldt finding prospects for mining and commercial advancement of the realm and made it clear that Humboldt was not to investigate social issues, nor criticize social conditions of Russian serfs. In his publications on Spanish America, he did comment on the conditions of the indigenous populations, and deplored black slavery, but well after he had left those territories. As Humboldt discovered, the government kept tight control of the expedition, even when it was 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from Moscow, with local government officials greeting the expedition at every stop. The itinerary was planned with Tobolsk the farthest destination, then a return to St Petersburg.\nHumboldt wrote to the Russian Minister Cancrin that he was extending his travel, knowing that the missive would not reach him in time to scuttle the plan. The further east he journeyed into wilder territory, the more Humboldt enjoyed it. They still followed the Siberian Highway and made excellent progress, sometimes a hundred miles (160 km) in a day. Although they were halted at the end of July and warned of an anthrax outbreak, Humboldt decided to continue despite the danger. \"At my age, nothing should be postponed\".The journey though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable scientifically. The correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the prediction of the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Urals, were important aspects of these travels. In the end, the expedition took 8 months, traveled 15,500 km, stopped at 658 post stations, and used 12,244 horses.One writer claims that \"Nothing was quite as Humboldt wanted it. The entire expedition was a compromise.\" The Russian emperor offered Humboldt an invitation to return to Russia, but Humboldt declined, due to his disapproval of Nicholas's restrictions on his freedom of movement during the expedition and his ability to freely report on it. Humboldt published two works on the Russian expedition, first Fragments de g\u00e9ologie et de climatologie asiatiques in 1831, based on lectures he gave on the topic. In 1843, he completed the three-volume Asie Centrale, which he dedicated to Czar Nicholas, which he called \"an unavoidable step, as the expedition was accomplished at his expense\". As of 2016, these works have not been translated to English. His 1829 expedition to Russia when he was an old man is much less known than his five-year travels in Spanish America, which had resulted in many published volumes over the decades since his 1804 return. Nevertheless, it gave Humboldt comparative data for his various later scientific publications.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Cosmos ===\n\nKosmos was Humboldt's multi-volume effort in his later years to write a work bringing together all the research from his long career. The writing took shape in lectures he delivered before the University of Berlin in the winter of 1827\u201328. These lectures would form \"the cartoon for the great fresco of the [K]osmos\". His 1829 expedition to Russia supplied him with data comparative to his Latin American expedition.The first two volumes of the Kosmos were published between the years 1845 and 1847 were intended to comprise the entire work, but Humboldt published three more volumes, one of which was posthumous. Humboldt had long aimed to write a comprehensive work about geography and the natural sciences. The work attempted to unify the sciences then known in a Kantian framework. With inspiration from German Romanticism, Humboldt sought to create a compendium of the world's environment. He spent the last decade of his long life\u2014as he called them, his \"improbable\" years\u2014continuing this work. The third and fourth volumes were published in 1850\u201358; a fragment of a fifth appeared posthumously in 1862.\nHis reputation had long since been made with his publications on the Latin American expedition. There is not a consensus on the importance of Kosmos. One scholar, who stresses the importance of Humboldt's Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain as essential reading, dismisses Kosmos as \"little more than an academic curiosity\". A different opinion is that Kosmos was his \"most influential book\".As with most of Humboldt's works, Kosmos was also translated into multiple languages in editions of uneven quality. It was very popular in Britain and America. In 1849 a German newspaper commented that in England two of the three different translations were made by women, \"while in Germany most of the men do not understand it\". The first translation by Augustin Pritchard\u2014published anonymously by Mr. Bailli\u00e8re (volume I in 1845 and volume II in 1848)\u2014suffered from being hurriedly made. In a letter Humboldt said of it: \"It will damage my reputation. All the charm of my description is destroyed by an English sounding like Sanskrit.\"The other two translations were made by Elizabeth Juliana Leeves Sabine under the superintendence of her husband Col. Edward Sabine (4 volumes 1846\u20131858), and by Elise Ott\u00e9 (5 volumes 1849\u20131858, the only complete translation of the 4 German volumes). These three translations were also published in the United States. The numbering of the volumes differs between the German and the English editions. Volume 3 of the German edition corresponds to the volumes 3 and 4 of the English translation, as the German volume appeared in 2 parts in 1850 and 1851. Volume 5 of the German edition was not translated until 1981, again by a woman. Ott\u00e9's translation benefited from a detailed table of contents, and an index for every volume; of the German edition only volumes 4 and 5 had (extremely short) tables of contents, and the index to the whole work only appeared with volume 5 in 1862. Less well known in Germany is the atlas belonging to the German edition of the Cosmos \"Berghaus' Physikalischer Atlas\", better known as the pirated version by Traugott Bromme under the title \"Atlas zu Alexander von Humboldt's Kosmos\" (Stuttgart 1861).In Britain, Heinrich Berghaus planned to publish together with Alexander Keith Johnston a \"Physical Atlas\". But later Johnston published it alone under the title \"The Physical Atlas of Natural Phenomena\". In Britain its connection to the Cosmos seems not have been recognized.\n\n\n=== Other publications ===\n\nAlexander von Humboldt published prolifically throughout his life. Many works were published originally in French or German, then translated to other languages, sometimes with competing translation editions. Humboldt himself did not keep track of all the various editions. He wrote specialized works on particular topics of botany, zoology, astronomy, mineralogy, among others, but he also wrote general works that attracted a wide readership, especially his Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent during the years 1799\u20131804 His Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain was widely read in Mexico itself, the United States, as well as in Europe.Many of the original works have been digitally scanned by the Biodiversity Library. There have been new editions of print works, including his Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas (2014), which includes reproductions of all the color and black and white plates. In the original edition, the publication was in a large format and quite expensive. There is a 2009 translation of his Geography of Plants and a 2014 English edition of Views of Nature.\n\n\n== Influence on scientists and artists ==\n\nHumboldt was generous toward his friends and mentored young scientists. He and Bonpland parted ways after their return to Europe, and Humboldt largely took on the task of publishing the results of their Latin American expedition at Humboldt's expense, but he included Bonpland as co-author on the nearly published 30 volumes. Bonpland returned to Latin America, settling in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then moved to the countryside near the border with Paraguay. The forces of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia, the strong man of Paraguay, abducted Bonpland after killing Bonpland's estate workers. Bonpland was accused of \"agricultural espionage\" and of threatening Paraguay's virtual monopoly on the cultivation of yerba mate. \nDespite international pressure, including the British government and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's, along with European scientists including Humboldt, Francia kept Bonpland prisoner until 1831. He was released after nearly 10 years in Paraguay. Humboldt and Bonpland maintained a warm correspondence about science and politics until Bonpland's death in 1858.During Humboldt's time in Paris, he met in 1818 the young and brilliant Peruvian student of the Royal Mining School of Paris, Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz. Subsequently, Humboldt acted as a mentor of the career of this promising Peruvian scientist. Another recipient of Humboldt's aid was Louis Agassiz (1807\u20131873), who was directly aided with needed cash from Humboldt, assistance in securing an academic position, and help with getting his research on zoology published. Agassiz sent him copies of his publications and went on to gain considerable scientific recognition as a professor at Harvard. Agassiz delivered an address to the Boston Society of Natural History in 1869, on the centenary of his patron's birth. When Humboldt was an elderly man, he aided another young scholar, Gotthold Eisenstein, a brilliant, young, Jewish mathematician in Berlin, for whom he obtained a small crown pension and whom he nominated for the Academy of Science.Humboldt's popular writings inspired many scientists and naturalists, including Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel,, Ida Laura Pfeiffer as well as brothers Richard and Robert Schomburgk.Humboldt carried on correspondence with many contemporaries and two volumes of letters to Karl August Varnhagen von Ense have been published.Charles Darwin made frequent reference to Humboldt's work in his Voyage of the Beagle, where Darwin described his own scientific exploration of the Americas. In one note, he placed Humboldt first on the \"list of American travellers\". Darwin's work was influenced by Humboldt's writing style as well. Darwin's sister remarked to him \"you had, probably from reading so much of Humboldt, got his phraseology and the kind of flower French expressions he uses\".When Darwin's Journal was published, he sent a copy to Humboldt, who responded, \"You told me in your kind letter that, when you were young, the manner in which I studied and depicted nature in the torrid zones contributed toward exciting in you the ardour and desire to travel in distant lands. Considering the importance of your work, Sir, this may be the greatest success that my humble work could bring.\" In his autobiography, Darwin recalled, reading \"with care and profound interest Humboldt's Personal Narrative\" and finding it one of the two most influential books on his work, which stirred in him \"a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science\".Humboldt would later reveal to Darwin in the 1840s that he had been a fan of Darwin's grandfather's poetry. Erasmus Darwin had published the poem The Loves of the Plants in the early 1800s. Humboldt praised the poem for combining nature and imagination, a theme that permeated Humboldt's own work.\n\nA number of nineteenth-century artists traveled to Latin America, following in the footsteps of Humboldt, painting landscapes and scenes of everyday life. Johann Moritz Rugendas, Ferdinand Bellermann, and Eduard Hildebrandt were three important European painters. Frederic Edwin Church was the most famous landscape painter in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. His paintings of Andean volcanoes that Humboldt climbed helped make Church's reputation. His 5 foot by 10 foot painting entitled The Heart of the Andes \"caused a sensation\" when it was completed. Church had hoped to ship the painting to Berlin to show the painting to Humboldt, but Humboldt died a few days after Church's letter was written. Church painted Cotopaxi three times, twice in 1855 and then in 1859 in eruption.\nGeorge Catlin, most famous for his portraits of North American Indians and paintings of life among various North American tribes also traveled to South America, producing a number of paintings. He wrote to Humboldt in 1855, sending him his proposal for South American travels. Humboldt replied, thanking him and sending a memorandum helping guide his travels.Ida Laura Pfeiffer, one of the first female travelers who completed two trips around the world from 1846 to 1855, followed in Humboldt's footsteps. The two explorers met in Berlin in 1851 before Pfeiffer's second tour and again in 1855 when she returned to Europe. Humboldt provided Pfeiffer with an open letter of introduction in which he bade anyone who knew of his name to assist Madame Pfeiffer for her \"inextinguishable energy of character which she has everywhere shown, to wheresoever's she has been called or better put, driven by her unconquerable passion to study nature and man.\"\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Other aspects of Humboldt's life and career ==\n\n\n=== Humboldt and the Prussian monarchy ===\n\nIn the Napoleonic wars, Prussia had capitulated to France, signing the Treaty of Tilsit. The Prussian royal family returned to Berlin, but sought better terms of the treaty and Friedrich Wilhelm III commissioned his younger brother Prince Wilhelm with this. Friedrich Wilhelm III asked Alexander to be part of the mission, charged with introducing the prince to Paris society. This turn of events for Humboldt could not have been better, since he desired to live in Paris rather than Berlin.In 1814 Humboldt accompanied the allied sovereigns to London. Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the congress of Aachen. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the Congress of Verona, proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823. Humboldt had long regarded Paris as his true home. Thus, when at last he received from his sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed reluctantly.\nBetween 1830 and 1848 Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to the court of King Louis Philippe of France, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations. Charles X of France had been overthrown, with Louis-Philippe of the house of Orl\u00e9ans becoming king. Humboldt knew the family, and he was sent by the Prussian monarch to Paris to report on events to his monarch. He spent three years in France, from 1830 to 1833. His friends Fran\u00e7ois Arago and Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, were appointed to posts in Louis-Philippe's government.Humboldt's brother, Wilhelm, died on 8 April 1835. Alexander lamented that he had lost half of himself with the death of his brother. Upon the accession of the crown prince Frederick William IV in June 1840, Humboldt's favor at court increased. Indeed, the new king's craving for Humboldt's company became at times so importunate as to leave him only a few waking hours to work on his writing.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nBecause Humboldt did not mention God in his work Cosmos, and sometimes spoke unfavourably of religious attitudes, it was occasionally speculated that he was a materialist philosopher, or perhaps an atheist. However, unlike irreligious figures such as Robert G. Ingersoll, who went so far as to use Humboldtian science to campaign against religion, Humboldt himself denied imputations of atheism. In a letter to Varnhagen von Ense he emphasized that he believed the world had indeed been created, writing of Cosmos: \"...'creation' and the 'created world' are never lost sight of in the book. And did I not, only eight months ago, in the French translation, say, in the plainest terms: 'It is this necessity of things, this occult but permanent connection, this periodical return in the progress, development of formation, phenomena, and events which constitute 'Nature' submissive to a controlling power?'\"It has been argued that \"although Humboldt emphasizes the basis of morality in the nature of man, he does acknowledge that a belief in God is linked directly to acts of virtue\" and therefore \"the dignity of man lies at the centre of Humboldt's religious thought\".Humboldt also believed firmly in an afterlife. A letter he wrote to his friend Charlotte Hildebrand Diede states: \"God constantly appoints the course of nature and of circumstances; so that, including his existence in an eternal future, the happiness of the individual does not perish, but on the contrary grows and increases.\"Humboldt remained distant of organized religion: he did not believe in the Bible as an inerrant document, nor in the divinity of Jesus; yet, Humboldt still held deep respect for the ideal side of religious belief and church life within human communities. He differentiated between \"negative\" religions, and those \"all positive religions [which] consist of three distinct parts\u2014a code of morals which is nearly the same in all of them, and generally very pure; a geological chimera, and a myth or a little historical novel\". In Cosmos, he wrote about how rich geological descriptions were found in different religious traditions, and stated: \"Christianity gradually diffused itself, and, wherever it was adopted as the religion of the state, it not only exercised a beneficial condition on the lower classes by inculcating the social freedom of mankind, but also expanded the views of men in their communion with Nature...this tendency to glorify the Deity in his works gave rise to a taste for natural observation.\"Humboldt showed religious tolerance towards Judaism, and he criticized the political Jews Bill, which was an initiative intended to establish legal discrimination against Jews. He called this an \"abominable\" law, since he hoped to see Jews being treated equally in society.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\n\nMuch of Humboldt's private life remains a mystery because he destroyed his private letters. While a gregarious personality, he may have harbored a sense of social alienation, which drove his passion for escape through travel.Humboldt never married: while he was charmed by a number of attractive women, including Henriette, the wife of his mentor Marcus Herz, his sister-in-law Caroline von Humboldt stated \"nothing will ever have a great influence on Alexander that doesn't come through men\". He had many strong male friendships, and at times had romances with men.As a student he became infatuated with Wilhelm Gabriel Wegener, a theology student, penning a succession of letters expressing his \"fervent love\". At 25 he met Reinhardt von Haeften (19 May 1772 \u2013 20 October 1803), a 21-year-old lieutenant, with whom he lived and travelled for two years, and to whom he wrote in 1794: \"I only live through you, my good precious Reinhardt\". When von Haeften became engaged, Humboldt begged to remain living with him and his wife: \"Even if you must refuse me, treat me coldly with disdain, I should still want to be with you... the love I have for you is not just friendship or brotherly love, it is veneration\".A traveling companion in the Americas for five years was Aim\u00e9 Bonpland, and in Quito in 1802 he met the Ecuadorian aristocrat Don Carlos Mont\u00fafar, who traveled with Humboldt to Europe and lived with him. In France, Humboldt traveled and lived with the physicist and balloonist Joseph Louis Gay Lussac. Later he had a deep friendship with the married French astronomer Fran\u00e7ois Arago, whom he met daily for 15 years.Humboldt once wrote \"I don't know sensual needs\". However, a pious travelling companion, Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas, accused him of frequenting houses in Quito where \"impure love reigned\", of making friends with \"obscene dissolute youths\", of giving vent to \"shameful passions of his heart\", and dropping him to travel with \"Bonpland and his Adonis\"[Mon\u00fafar].Humboldt inherited a significant fortune, but the expense of his travels, and most especially of publishing (thirty volumes in all), had by 1834 made him totally reliant on the pension of King Frederick William III. Although he preferred living in Paris, by 1836 the King had insisted he return to Germany. He lived with the Court at Sanssouci, and latterly in Berlin, with his valet Seifert, who had accompanied him to Russia in 1829.\n\nFour years before his death, Humboldt executed a deed of gift transferring his entire estate to Seifert, who had by then married and set up a household near Humboldt's apartment. Humboldt had become godfather to his daughter. The scale of the bequest has always drawn speculation, especially as Seifert was some thirty years younger, and introducing lower class partners into households under the guise of servants was then a common practice.In 1908, the sexual researcher Paul N\u00e4cke gathered reminiscences from homosexuals including Humboldt's friend the botanist Karl Bolle, then 90 years old: some of the material was incorporated by Magnus Hirschfeld into his 1914 study Homosexuality in Men and Women. However, speculations about Humboldt's private life and possible homosexuality continue to remain a fractious issue amongst scholars, particularly as earlier biographers had portrayed him as \"a largely asexual, Christ-like Humboldt figure...suitable as a national idol\".\n\n\n=== Illness and death ===\nOn 24 February 1857, Humboldt suffered a minor stroke, which passed without perceptible symptoms. It was not until the winter of 1858\u20131859 that his strength began to decline; on 6 May 1859, he died peacefully in Berlin, aged 89. His last words were reported to be \"How glorious these sunbeams are! They seem to call Earth to the Heavens!\" His remains were conveyed in state through the streets of Berlin, in a hearse drawn by six horses. Royal chamberlains led the cort\u00e8ge, each charged with carrying a pillow with Humboldt's medals and other decorations of honor. Humboldt's extended family, descendants of his brother Wilhelm, walked in the procession. Humboldt's coffin was received by the prince-regent at the door of the cathedral. He was interred at the family resting-place at Tegel, alongside his brother Wilhelm and sister-in-law Caroline.\n\n\n== Honours and namesakes ==\nThe honours which had been showered on Humboldt during life continued after his death. More species are named after Humboldt than after any other human being. The first centenary of Humboldt's birth was celebrated on 14 September 1869, with great enthusiasm in both the New and Old Worlds. Numerous monuments were constructed in his honour, such as Humboldt Park in Chicago, planned that year and constructed shortly after the Chicago fire. Newly explored regions and species named after Humboldt, as discussed below, also stand as a measure of his wide fame and popularity.\n\n\n=== Honours ===\n1842: Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil division)\n1850: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus\n1863: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Guadalupe\n\n\n=== Species named after Humboldt ===\nHumboldt described many geographical features and species that were hitherto unknown to Europeans.

It is the Dutch equivalent of the widely known annual Hettner lectures at the University of Heidelberg.\n\n\n=== The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation ===\nAfter his death, Humboldt's friends and colleagues created the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Stiftung in German) to continue his generous support of young academics. Although the original endowment was lost in the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, and again as a result of World War II, the Foundation has been re-endowed by the German government to award young academics and distinguished senior academics from abroad. It plays an important role in attracting foreign researchers to work in Germany and enabling German researchers to work abroad for a period.\n\n\n=== Dedications ===\nEdgar Allan Poe dedicated his last major work, Eureka: A Prose Poem, to Humboldt, \"With Very Profound Respect\". Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences in his Kosmos was a major inspiration for Poe's project.\n\n\n=== Ships ===\nAlexander von Humboldt is also a German ship named after the scientist, originally built in 1906 by the German shipyard AG Weser at Bremen as Reserve Sonderburg. She was operated throughout the North and Baltic Seas until being retired in 1986. Subsequently, she was converted into a three-masted barque by the German shipyard Motorwerke Bremerhaven, and was re-launched in 1988 as Alexander von Humboldt.\nThe Jan De Nul Group operates a hopper dredger built in 1998 also named Alexander von Humboldt.\n\n\n=== Recognitions by contemporaries ===\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar wrote that \"The real discoverer of South America was Humboldt, since his work was more useful for our people than the work of all conquerors\". Charles Darwin expressed his debt to Humboldt, and admiration for his work, writing to Joseph Dalton Hooker that Humboldt was the \"greatest scientific traveller who ever lived\".  Wilhelm von Humboldt wrote that \"Alexander is destined to combine ideas and follow chains of thoughts which would otherwise have remained unknown for ages. His depth, his sharp mind and his incredible speed are a rare combination.\" Johann Wolfgang Goethe observed that \"Humboldt showers us with true treasures\". Friedrich Schiller wrote that \"Alexander impresses many, particularly when compared to his brother\u2014because he shows off more!\" Jos\u00e9 de la Luz y Caballero wrote that \"Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects\". \nNapol\u00e9on Bonaparte remarked \"You have been studying Botanics? Just like my wife!\" Claude Louis Berthollet said \"This man is as knowledgeable as a whole academy\". Thomas Jefferson remarked \"I consider him the most important scientist whom I have met\". Emil Du Bois-Reymond wrote that \"Every scientist is a descendant of Humboldt. We are all his family.\" Robert G. Ingersoll wrote that \"He was to science what Shakespeare was to the drama\".Hermann von Helmholtz wrote that \"During the first half of the present century we had an Alexander von Humboldt, who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details, and to bring it within one vast generalization. At the present juncture, it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in a similar way, even by a mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as Humboldt's was, and if all his time and work were devoted to the purpose.\"\n\n\n=== Honorary doctorates ===\n1829 Universit\u00e4t DorpatSculptures\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Scientific works ===\n\n\n=== Other works ===\nLetters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense.

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

          "This review is tough to do as we stayed here during the beginning of the virus craziness and the hotel was only at 20%. I will say Gerardo (front desk check in) and Isabel (pool server) were very nice and attentive to our needs. It was nice \u2026",
          "I'll admit - when we first arrived there were some room issues. The difference between Fiesta Americana and other hotels is that the staff and manager will work to solve the problem immediately. Definitely worthy of 5 stars. Things happen, \u2026",
          "The views from this hotel are amazing. One of the pools is under construction so we missed out on that one. We felt very safe. My son left his baseball cap behind and we recovered it in lost and found. Fresh clean sheets daily were a plus. \u2026",
          "Great service and value. Location is central to everything. Ocean views and balconies are amazing. Part of the Pool was under renovation but it met my family\u2019s needs. We loved it and we\u2019re coming back.",

          "In order to get to the beach, you must go down three flight of stairs. No elevator or lift. Obviously an issue for the disabled, but also the elderly must take into account they need to go up  3 stories. Otherwise friendly, secure,  nice and clean place.",
          "It was a great experience. My family and I have been in the hotel before and I can say the are getting better with the refurbishing of the hotel rooms and open areas. Also the staff has a nice and polite attiude. Compliments!",

          "El hotel hermoso, la habitaci\u00f3n como apartamento espectacular, el servicio, el personal magn\u00edfico. La comida de los 3 restaurantes maravillosa. Aunque un \u00e1rea estaba en remodelacion, no le quita belleza.",
          "Only reason for a 3 Star is the staff, otherwise it would be a 1. The rooms are clean and nice enough but they are a bit humid. We came for a promotion and there was an issue with it not being correct. There was no management on \u2026",
          "I stay there every year for good reason. Even when the pool is being renovated.",
          "Part of a big chain. You can find the little details of a five star resort like the shaving kit in the bathroom, or a sweet in your room every day after the maid has done their job. But probably the best part is the warmth and attitude of the staff, which is a feature of the town. They truly know how to make tourists feel welcome.",
          "Best place to stay in playa condesa! The beach is literally perfect and beautiful and literally at the Foot off the hotel. The sand is soft and nice. Every morning they clean up the beach of seaweed or any other debris. \n\nDefinitely a Must \u2026",
          "I always get nervous booking hotels, but this hotel is fantastic. It's very clean, the rooms are a good size, the view is breathtaking, and the bar makes killer drinks. It did take a while to check in when we arrived, however, I think it \u2026",

          "Stayed at this property twice in prior years without issue. This year the pool is being refurbished and no alternate accommodations were made available. The shower was antiquated with no pressure but plenty of cold water.",
          "Nice place to stay. Not a five star, but its comfortable and safe.",
          "During my  stay some very tragic personal circumstances occurred and the staff and management went out of their way to work with and make me as comfortable as they possibly could. They tended to all my needs both large and small, making an extremely difficult situation as easy and as well as it could be.",

          "Customer service is excellent! My grandmother joined me on this trip and she was in a lot of pain, I asked the front desk if they could lend us a wheelchair for the remainder of the visit they stated they would call me back to let me know \u2026",

          "Very bad customer service, rooms smelled and need updating .",
          "Noisy as a place can be and though some members of the staff tried to accommodate us the noise is just impossible to escape. Management was the least helpful even though they acknowledged this is a constant problem. Avoid at all cost.",
          "A truly amazing experience/price ratio. The staff is always kind and helpful and will go to extra lengths to ensure you're comfortable. You go from room to beach in under two minutes depending on your floor and the facilities are top notch. Just be ready for your daily dose of cringe inducing english.",

          "I love the service. People was great with us and they help us with every single request we made. What I hate about this place is that nobody tell something to the people that is in the swimming pool in clothes or smoking weed.

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

          "We gave been there for a conference, for that it was great, the hotel has a very nice convention center! \nThe hotel is ok, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best choice for a seaside holiday because it\u2019s not by the ocean. But it is a part of a \u2026",

          "The rooms are nice and they are acceptably clean though they could do better. I stayed on the ninth floor. The halls lack A/C and Windows/natural light or at least light fixtures that are not as dim. The room is nice, beds are comfortable \u2026",
          "The hotel was great choice. They upgraded our room and it was ok, but two things you need to consider: there is no ocean access in the hotel as you need to take a bus to get to the sea. If you get late there you won\u2019t even find seat to pop \u2026",

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

          "The area from the flag to Commercial is a good place. Soriana (very modern) and Aurrera (walmarts value brand) are right across the road for food and beer. The water is pretty calm with the sheltering rocks. I've seen tourists take their hammocks and string them between palm"

        "wiki": "Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez (Spanish: [aka\u02c8pulko \u00f0e \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)), commonly called Acapulco ( AK-\u0259-PUUL-koh, also US:  AHK-), is a city and major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, 380 kilometres (240 mi) south of Mexico City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between Panama and San Francisco, California, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and balneario resort city.The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s through the 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco was once a popular tourist resort, but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since 2014 it no longer attracts many foreign tourists, and most now only come from Mexico itself. It is both the second deadliest city in Mexico and the second-deadliest city in the world; the US government has warned its citizens not to travel there. In 2016 there were 918 murders, and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world: 103 in every 100,000. In September 2018 the city's entire police force was disarmed by the military, due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drug gangs.The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the \"traditional\" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagayo through the Z\u00f3calo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as \"Zona Dorada\" ('golden zone' in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end, \"Diamante\" ('diamond' in Spanish), which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.\nThe name \"Acapulco\" comes from Nahuatl language Aca-p\u014dl-co, and means \"where the reeds were destroyed or washed away\". The \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Benito Ju\u00e1rez, former President of Mexico (1806\u20131872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of Capul, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul. Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to Manila, in what was then a Spanish colony.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\n\nBy the 8th century around the Acapulco Bay area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta, and Tambuco.In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the Aztec Empire during the reign of Ahuizotl (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named Tepecuacuilco. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.\nThe first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of New Spain. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates, such as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan and Thomas Cavendish, who called it \"The Black Ship\". A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The Fort of San Diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the Mexican War of Independence began. In 1810, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the Plan de Ayutla. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.\nIn 1920, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by a businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Brigitte Bardot. The 1963 Hollywood movie Fun in Acapulco, starring Elvis Presley, is set in Acapulco although the filming took place in the United States. Former swing musician Teddy Stauffer, the so-called \"Mister Acapulco\", was a hotel manager (\"Villa Vera\", \"Casablanca\"), who attracted many celebrities to Acapulco.From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pope Pius XII. It became an archdiocese in 1983.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur. For the 1968 Summer Olympics in neighboring Mexico City, Acapulco hosted the sailing (then yachting) events.\nIn the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.The Miss Universe 1978 pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel wrote the song \"Amor eterno\", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by Rocio Durcal. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer, and comedian A\u00edda Pierce, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe tollway known as the Ruta del Sol was built during the 1990s, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three-and-a-half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively, and as a result new types of services emerged, such as the Colegio Nautilus. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.The city was devastated by Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving river of sludge three feet in depth.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.\nA major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Sendero shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces.On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, Mexican politician Braulio Zaragoza was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil that the number of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the number of international tourists flying to Acapulco dropped 85% in the interval of nine years.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nThe city, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the Costa Grande and the Costa Chica. Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain; another forty percent is semi-flat; and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to 1,699 metres (5,574 feet). The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas, and Alto Camar\u00f3n. One major river runs through the municipality, the Papagayo, along with a number of arroyos (streams). There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca, along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in Mexico, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and seabirds, and marine animals such as turtles. Oddly enough, January, its coolest month, also features its all-time record high.\n\nThe temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) between January \u2013 March, and a high of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.\nThe metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAcapulco is the most populated city in the state of Guerrero, according to the results of the II Population and Housing Census 2010 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) with a census date of June 12, 2010, The city had until then a total population of 673 479 inhabitants, of that amount, 324 746 were men and 348 733 women. It is considered the twenty-second most populous city in Mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Mexico. It is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality, representing 85.25 percent of the 789.971 inhabitants.The metropolitan area of Acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of Acapulco de Ju\u00e1rez and four in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. In agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in 2010 altogether by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the National Council of Population and the Secretariat of Social Development, the metropolitan area of Acapulco grouped a total of 863 431 inhabitants in a surface of 3 538.5 km\u00b2, which placed it as the tenth most populated district in Mexico. It is estimated according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico on climate and geography, carried out in 2002, that between 2015 and 2020 the city of Acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants.\n\nNotes\n      Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda \n      Population census (1895 - 1990, 2000 and 2010)\n      Population Counts (1995 and 2005)\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAcapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.The city is divided into three tourist areas.\nTraditional Acapulco is the old part of the port, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities Johnny Weissmuller and John Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. Anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as El Zocalo.  The heyday of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 1930s until the 1960s, with development continuing through the 1980s. This older section of town now caters to a mostly middle-class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.Acapulco Dorado had its development between the 1950s and the 1970s, and is about 25 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels,\nAcapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along Boulevard de las Naciones, almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the MS Queen Victoria, the MS Rotterdam, Crystal Harmony, and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Ocean Star Cruises.For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as Luis Miguel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who maintain homes there.\n\n\n==== Problems ====\nWhile much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass\u00e9 resort, eclipsed by the newer Canc\u00fan and Cabo San Lucas. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region:\nRelleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\nPozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby 'O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various DJs have had performances in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, Nervo and Junkie KID.Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a bungee jump in this area as well.\n\nAnother attraction at Acapulco is the La Quebrada Cliff Divers. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of forty metres (130 feet) into an inlet that is only seven m (23 ft) wide and four m (13 ft) deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the \"Ocean of Fire\" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarr\u00f3n, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the Fort of San Diego, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Hist\u00f3rico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well. For many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse-drawn carriages known as calandrias, but the practice ended in February 2020 due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals.\n\nThe El Rollo Acapulco is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has a life-sized replica of a Spanish galleon, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals can be seen by the public.There is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes, Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the Peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, which takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city's interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cin\u00e9polis Galer\u00edas Diana and the Teatro Juan Ru\u00edz de Alarc\u00f3n present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqu\u00e9s course, the latter designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Pedro Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by Robert von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel tennis tournament, an ATP 500 event that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic. The total prize money is US$250,000.00 for WTA (women) and US$1,200,000.00 for ATP (men).Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.\n\n\n=== Spring break ===\nBefore 2010, over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the drinking age of 18 years (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Daytona Beach, Florida, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canc\u00fan had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Canc\u00fan has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Canc\u00fan. Many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning\u2014a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel d\u00e9b\u00e2cle\u2014took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. Bill O'Reilly devoted a segment of his show, The O'Reilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nMany airlines fly to Acapulco International Airport. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"Hello Kitty\" themes.The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of 36.2 kilometres (22.5 miles), counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n=== Twin towns and partner cities ===\n\n\n==== International ====\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n Teocaltiche, 2005\n Dolores Hidalgo, 2009\n Guanajuato City, 2010\n Boca del R\u00edo, 2012\n Morelia, 2013\n\n\n== Pending transboundary UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations ==\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico.\nThe following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value.The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination.\nSpain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAcapulco (municipality)\nTriangle of the Sun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial city government website (in Spanish)",

It is the largest international airport in the country's southern Pacific region, and one of the largest air facilities in Mexico. Frequent flights are available daily from Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City as well as less frequent flights from other Mexican, American, and Canadian cities. The airport can accommodate jets up to the size of the Boeing 747.\nThis international airport is one of the top 15 airports in Mexico in terms of operations, receiving many international charter flights.\nThe facility has many services for passengers, including restaurants, VIP lounges, and several gates equipped with jetways, and is divided in two terminals, The Passenger terminal, serving all scheduled flight and all airlines (domestic and international) and the General Aviation terminal, which is a 1960s circular building.\nThe airport was named after Juan N. \u00c1lvarez Hurtado, a Mexican military who was instrumental in most of the armed conflicts in the beginning of Mexican independence, Governor of Guerrero and President of Mexico.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n== Traffic statistics ==\n\n\n=== Passengers ===\nList of passengers per year since 2001.\n\n\n=== Busiest routes ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the busiest airports in Mexico\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGrupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte de M\u00e9xico",

It is located in Tobolsk, Tyumen Oblast, Russia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTobolsk was founded in 1587. Moscow encouraged the construction of stone buildings there. In 1683-1686, masons sent from Moscow and Veliky Ustyug built the stone St. Sophia-Assumption Cathedral. Around the beginning of the 18th century the stone walls and the towers of the Kremlin were built, as well as a number of buildings that have not survived to our days, standing on a westward line from  St. Sophia-Assumption Cathedral: the Holy Trinity Cathedral, the Bishop's House, the Holy Gate with the Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh and the bell tower. The Siberian Metropolitan Paul (who, before the appointment to Tobolsk, was the Archimandrite of the Chudov Monastery in the Moscow Kremlin) supervised the construction. The cathedrals built under his supervision were cross-domed structures topped by five domes.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century construction work in the Kremlin was continued by Semyon Remezov, a cartographer who was also the first historian of Siberia. He had the Departmental Palace (1699\u20131704) built above the southern cliff of the hill and the Trading Arcades (1702\u20131706) in the northwestern corner of the Kremlin.\n\nKnyaz M. Gagarin, appointed in 1708 first governor of the Siberian province, planned to create in the Kremlin impressive buildings for military administrative and commercial use, which should have constituted, together with the Sofia court a monumental center. In construction works were employed Swedish prisoners of war who were in exile in Tobolsk. To prevent the erosion of the mountain, the Tobol River  was moved to the south for two versts. In 1712, by the project of Remezov  was built the stone tower Demetrius gate and next to it, on the edge of the mountain, the Ascension church (destroyed in 1717).\nDespite the 1714 ban of stone construction, work continued until 1718. After the execution of governor Gagarin, the Demetrius gate remained unfinished. \nIn 1743-1746 was built the Church of the Intercession, accessory building of St Sophia-Assumption Cathedral. Walls and towers were gradually destroyed. In 1799 were built  the stone retaining walls of St. Sophia gully and a new multi-tier bell tower - the tallest building of the city.\n\n\n== Protection and reconstruction ==\nIn 1939 the Tobolsk Kremlin has been recognized architectural historical monument, subject to state protection. In 1952, a progressive deterioration of masonry was revealed and thus a plan for restoration work was drafted. In 1961, the Tobolsk museum received the status of Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve.\nIn early 1970s the restoration works began. The walls and the towers were reconstructed.\nThe photograph taken 2009 by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was auctioned for charity at the St Petersburg Christmas yarmarka (fair) in 2010 for the equivalent of U$1.75 million, earning it a place on the list of most expensive photographs.\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory of Tobolsk Kremlin (in Russian)\nHistory of Tobolsk and its Kremlin on Tobolsk portal (in Russian)",

        "wiki": "The Church of the Saviour, also known as the Church of the Image of \"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\" (Russian: \u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u041d\u0435\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0451\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041e\u0301\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0301\u0441\u0430, Khram v chest' Nerukotvoryonogo Obraza Spasa) or shorter Spasskaya Church (Russian: \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c, Spasskaya Tserkov), is a church in Tyumen, Tyumen Oblast, Russia, located at Lenin Street, 43, in a crossroad between the Chelyuskintsev Street. Built in a late 18th-century Siberian Baroque and early 20th-century neorussian style, the building is one of the oldest and most expressive churches in Siberia, which is under monument protection.\nIt is believed that the early wooden church was raised in 1586, which after several fires was reconstructed into a stable stone building in the late 17th century. The Church of the Saviour saw another two rebuildings in the late 19th century. After the 1917 October Revolution, the church was subject of confiscations of its property in 1922, and in 1930 was closed and became a momentary prison. After the failed attempt to destroy the church two years later, it has been used as an archive and a library. Nowadays the building stores material for the Tyumen Local Historical Museum, but is expected to be returned to the local eparchy in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The church at the Large Spasskaya Street ===\n\nAccording to the Kungursk Codex (p. 121), the first Church of the Saviour was constructed in 1586 in the Tyumen Kremlin:\n\non the raised town of Tyumen, July of day 29, which Chingi heareth, the Church of the All-Merciful Saviour was raiseth, the first one in Siberia\nThe Kazan church historian Ivan Pokrovsky agreed with the codex. However, according to the Esipov Codex, the Siberian ethnographer Nikolay Abramov and Pyotr Butsinsky from Kharkov, the mentioned church was a different one in Tyumen. P. N. Butsinsky names a document, which states that in the 16th century there was no such church with that name in the town.The first reliable account of the Tyumen Church of the Saviour comes from the 1624 Dozornaya book, which describes a wooden, \"cold\" All-Merciful Church in a posad. It was located on the Market (Guest) square, near the walls of the Tyumen Kremlin. Local historian Aleksandr Ivanenko assumes that it was named after the Spasskaya gate tower of the Kremlin, from which started the Large Spasskaya Street (now the Republic Street). According to Ivanenko, the church was located a bit to the left of a house at the Republic Street; that place is now swamped by the Tura River.After a heavy fire in 1668 the walls of the posad were relocated to the east, and consequently the Spasskaya gate tower was moved from the Kremlin to the place of the burnt up Znamenskaya tower of the Ostrog walls; today it would be lying between the crossroad of the Republic and Chelyuskintsev Streets. The new walls of the posad at the future Irkutsk Street (now the Chelyskintsev Street) stood undamaged until another fire erupted in 1766. At the same time on a drawing of Tyumen between 1668 and 1695 from Nicolaas Witsen's book Northern and Eastern Tartaria and on a draft of the town around 1700, found by Golovachov in Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller's portfolio, the All-Merciful Church is seen in the same area near the Kremlin.\nIn the Tyumen city catalogue about the fire on 24 April [O.S. 14 April] 1687 there is also standing, that the Church of the Saviour was located near the Kremlin, and the fire sprang up to the Kremlin buildings. The church was also damaged in the fire of 12 October [O.S. 2 October] 1695, after which a decision was made to use stone as building material, but because of needs for the Northern War the plan was not completely realized. Academic M\u00fcller remarked that in 1741 the Church of the Image of \"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\" in Tyumen had a side altar of the Wondermaker Sergius of Radonezh, meaning the church was restored after the fire.\nS. P. Zavarikhin and B. A. Zhuchenko claim that the new stone church was built on the side of the wooden Church of the Saviour with the side altar of the Mother of God icon of Tikhvin; as the church was chopped off in 1753, it was moved in the first half of the 18th century to the present place. A. S. Ivanenko's claim that the icon of the Image of \"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\" was kept in the stone Church of the Saviour with which people went on annual crucessions up to the village of Kamenka since the 1650s, at any rate proofs the presence of both the wooden All-Merciful Church and the stone church. I. V. Belich thinks that after the fire of 1766 the wooden church was not recovered till 1796, the date when the stone church was being built; however, other opinions also exist.\n\n\n=== Stone church ===\n\nThe foundation of the stone Church of the Saviour and the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God (1768, destroyed), the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Sign (1768), the Church of the Feast of the Cross (1775), the Church of Archangel Michael (1781) and the Church of the Feast of the Ascension and Saint George (1789) concluded the third construction period in the history of Tyumen. The two floors high stone Church of the Saviour was groundkroken on 1 July [O.S. 20 June] 1796 (the memorial desk falsely states the year of 1794). In 1798, the winter (warm) church of the bottom floor was completed and consecrated in honor of the Mother of God icon of Tikhvin. The building of the upper church was finished only in 1819, and subsequently consecrated in honor of the Image of \"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\". The other name of the church \u2013 the Church of the Saviour \u2013 was given by its altar. The nearby street was also renamed subsequently.In the stone church, the builders (ktitors) and the church's oldest ministers were buried in special vaults. The one-year Saviour and Archangel faith school was opened at the church on 18 February [O.S. 6 February] 1893.Before the revolution, the building was reconstructed two times. The first one was drafted by architect B. B. Tsinke of the Tobolsk and Siberian eparchy in 1887. The westside was fortified by a massive two-floor parvise with cone porches in neorussian style. The new size crossed the red lines and practically enveloped the church. The other reconstruction was proposed by the mayor of Tyumen and the former merchant of the first guild Andrey Tekutyev, the latter of whom for many years, between 1902 and 1916, was churchwarden.\nAfter the death of his wife Evdokia Tekutyeva in 1913, the state architect K. P. Chakin drafted a construction plan of the side altar after the request of the buyer. However, the building was already a cultural property, after which the eparchial consistory had to send the project to the Imperial Archeological Commission, which in November 1913 forbade reconstruction, as those\n\nwill cloak very interesting artistic and architectural pieces of the northern facade and destroy beautiful platbands.\n\nWith that said, Tekutyev's prohibition was not overturned. K. P. Chakin changed the project, and from 1914 to 1916 the northern side altar was built with the mercenary's means. In the side altar altar stones were placed; on the first floor in honor of the namesake saints of the Tekutyev couple \u2013 Andrew of Crete and the venerable martyr Eudokia of Heliopolis, on the second floor in honor of John of Tobolsk and Sergius of Radonezh. Tekutyev and his wife were buried in the burial vault.The northern side altar almost exactly echoed the original size, having a unique in Siberia \"twin\" shape. After a few years, the western facade of the initial church and the northern side altar were put together with an outbuilding of a two floors combination of parvise and narthex, built in a neorussian-like style.\n\n\n=== Post-war era ===\nThe first wave of religious persecutions in Tyumen took place in 1922. From 8 April to 5 May, four pood (approximately 65,52 kg) and six pounds (approximately 240 g) of property was confiscated from the church. In November, at the 5th anniversary of the October Revolution, 41 town streets were renamed, including the Spasskaya Street (Saviour Street), which took the name of Lenin. Artist A. P. Mitinsky remembers how the remains of A. I. Tekutyev were taken from the church around that time, between 1920 and 1921. Until June 1927 the Church of the Saviour and the Church of All Saints were the town's only churches of the followers of Patriarch Tikhon (other two churches were given to members of the sect \"Obnovlenchestvo\"). About 1500 churchgoers of the Church of the Saviour were counted.In 1929 another wave of religious persecution began. One communist newspaper accused protoiereus Aleksey Tobolkin and the dean Ilya Populov of \"stealing\" church property. The ordinance of the presidium of the Tyumen city council decreed to close on 16 December the two Obnovlenchestvo churches, the Church of Our Lady of the Sign and the Archangel Michael Church, and eventually on 15 January 1930 the Church of the Saviour, for \"not paying debts\" and \"non-fulfillment of obligations for using religious property\". Initially the church was used as a momentary prison for criminals who were later exiled to the north for dekulakization. After the decreasing collectivization in 1932 and dekulakization, it was proposed to demolish the church, right after the Dormition of the Mother of God Cathedral, until a circular from 3 August, Nr. 17147, was sent by the Ministry of Education to the city council:\n\nThe sector of science informs, that the Church of the Saviour of the city of Tyumen is under accounting and protection of the Narkompros, and therefore any damages and robbery of its outer architecture are impermissible and will be punished for violating the VZIK and SNK decrets about the protection of archaic art monuments...\n\nAs a result, only one separately lying belfry was destroyed, and until 1960 the building (and, before that, the Holy Trinity monastery) was used as an archive by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), the Ministry for State Security (MGB) and the Ministry for Inner Affairs (MVD), and as the Central State Library (now the Tyumen Scientifical Library). From August 1941 to March 1942, 96 boxes of Crimean gold and antique museum valuables evacuated from a Simferopol museum during the Great Patriotic War were preserved there. The valuables were convoyed to Tyumen and guarded by K. Y. Dubinin, father of the former head of the Central Bank of Russia S. K. Dubinin.After the Council of People's Commisars published ordinances \"About the order of opening churches\" from 28 November 1943 and \"About the order of opening religious beadhouses\" from 19 November 1944, believers made a solicitation in 1945 in front of the Tyumen executive committee to return their church, as only one active church in that town existed at that time \u2013 the small All-Saints Church; instead, the committee opened entry to the Church of Our Lady of the Sign.Because of unsatisfactory conditions, the archive was moved in 1959 to Tobolsk, and the library into a new building at the Ordzhonikidze Street, 59. Funds and a scientific library settled in the church house. In an ordinance by the Council of Ministers from 22 May 1948, Nr. 503, the Church of the Saviour along with the Church of Our Lady of the Sign and the Holy Trinity monastery were protected as architectural monuments. The ordinance by the Council of Ministries of RSFSR from 30 August 1960, Nr. 1327, listed it under republican significance. In the mid-1970s began the restoration, but it was interrupted after the restorers were sent to Moscow for the upcoming 1980 Summer Olympic Games. The work was resumed only on 24 March 2004, upon the order of governor of the Tyumen Oblast S. S. Sobyanin, and was finished in autumn 2006.\n\n\n== The Church of the Saviour today ==\nToday the Church of the Saviour is an object of cultural heritage (a landmark) of federal significance (code 7210007000). It is used as a museum depository of the Tyumen Local Historical Museum. Among its exhibits is one of the first printed books in cyrillic, the Triodion by Schweipolt Fiol, published in 1492.On 15 July 1991 the presidium of the Tyumen City Council of the People's Deputies made a decision to give the church to the Tobolsk and Tyumen eparchy, but because of ungoing constructions of the new museum building on the Sovyetskaya Street, 63, the church is expected to be re-opened for worship in 2019.Since 2006, the Church of the Saviour was taken into a conflict when a new Marriott hotel, and then a housing estate, was planned to be built around it. Picketings, as well as the unrecognition of the area by the court and even an open letter by members of the Council of Writers of Russia (among the authors were V. N. Ganichev and V. N. Rasputin) were the results. The August 2012 adjudgement for members of the public sphere was declined by a cassation on 26 December that year.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church is oblong and three-parted, which is typical for western-Siberian religious buildings. \nThe plan of the Church of the Saviour reminds the earlier built Ascension and Saint George Church in Tyumen; although even some sizes are similar, the Church of the Saviour is still more originally. Elements of the Siberian Baroque were used, although less traditional as opposed to the Our Lady of the Sign Church.The church is extended by a nave, and a belfry stands above the refectory, reminding the \"octades on the quartets\" in its architecture. It is \"doubled\" not only in length \u2013 as it is based on two main volumes \u2013 but also in height by its two floors. The winter services took place in the basement, which was roofed by the nave vault. The facetted vault with eight troughs on the upper floor is more expressive. The platbands are very different by its design. As described by architecture historians, the \"Baroque style is noticeable in the church's plastered manufacture with figurical cupola covered by a fracture, broken pediments, and tiered contrastically degressive octades with sculptural volutes\".The motive of the eight cupolas gave the church an original decorative picture. The small size of the corner cupolas and a more complicated stepped construction of the main cupola made the church seen as having only one cupola. The apse is crowning at the height. The church's facades all have different decor. Polished tower-like pilasters are flanking the church's quartets, which, like fials, are crowned with small cupolas.Architecturally separated from other constructions is the wide, western-orientated parvise, built by B. B. Tsinke in 1887. It represents the neorussian style and differs in its fractional and plastered facades, which feature many kokoshniks, columns, different shirinkis (a type of coffers), \"runners\", \"perspective\" portals, tented roofs, among others. Researchers remark that the plaster congestion of the church's facades makes it one of the most decorative in Tyumen; according to S. P. Zavarikhina and V. A. Zhuchenko, \"it implies over a unity in architecture\" and \"no outbuilding is needed\".In that floor in the interior of the summer church are fragments of paintings, probably by a master of a manufactury, P. M. Belkov. There was also the wondermaking icon \"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\". The iconostasis was not found to the present day.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nP.

        "wiki": "A children's railway or pioneer railway is an extracurricular educational institution, where teenagers learn railway professions. This phenomenon originated in the USSR and was greatly developed in Soviet times. The world's first children's railway was opened in Gorky Park, Moscow, in 1932. At the breakup of the USSR, 52 children's railways existed in the country.\nMany children's railways are still functioning in post-Soviet states and Eastern European countries. Many exhibit railway technology not seen anymore on the main lines and can be seen as heritage railways. Even though few exceptions exist, most children's railways built in the Eastern Bloc have a track gauge of at least 600 mm (1 ft 11 5\u20448 in) and can carry full size narrow gauge rolling stock.\n\n\n== List of children's railways ==\nThere are children's railways situated in following cities:\n\n\n=== Armenia ===\nYerevan Children's railway\n\n\n=== Azerbaijan ===\nBaku Children's Railway\n\n\n=== Belarus ===\nChildren's Railroad (Minsk)\n\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\nPlovdiv\nKardzhali\n\n\n=== China ===\nHarbin\n\n\n=== Cuba ===\nCamag\u00fcey, Parque Camilo Cienfuegos\nHavana, Parque Lenin (not operating)\nHavana, Havana Zoo\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\nTbilisi\nRustavi (not operating)\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nBerliner Parkeisenbahn, Berlin, Wuhlheide\nParkeisenbahn Krumbholz, Bernburg, Krumbholzallee\nParkeisenbahn Chemnitz, Chemnitz, K\u00fcchwald\nParkeisenbahn Cottbus, Cottbus, Eliaspark - Spreeauenpark\nFerienlandeisenbahn Crispendorf, Crispendorf, Ferienland\nDresdner Parkeisenbahn, Dresden, Gro\u00dfer Garten\nParkeisenbahn Gera, Gera, Tierpark\nG\u00f6rlitzer Parkeisenbahn, G\u00f6rlitz, An der Landskronbrauerei\nParkeisenbahn Pei\u00dfnitzexpress Halle, Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Pei\u00dfnitzinsel\nLeipziger Parkeisenbahn, Leipzig-Wahren, Auensee\nPioniereisenbahn Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Rotehornpark, until 1967\nParkeisenbahn Plauen, Plauen, Syratal\nParkeisenbahn Vatterode, Vatterode, Vatter\u00f6der Teich\n\n\n=== Hungary ===\nChildren's Railway (Budapest)\nP\u00e9cs\nNagycenk\nTiszak\u00e9cske (suspended since 2009)\n\n\n=== Kazakhstan ===\nAlmaty\nKaraganda\nPavlodar (now defunct)\nShymkent\n\n\n=== Lithuania ===\nIgnalina\n\n\n=== Poland ===\nChorz\u00f3w, Silesian Culture and Recreation Park\nPozna\u0144, Park Railway Maltanka (now run by the city)\n\n\n=== Russia ===\n\nChelyabinsk\nChita\nEkaterinburg\nIrkutsk\nKazan\nKemerovo\nFar East Children's Railway, Khabarovsk\nKrasnoyarsk\nKratovo\nKurgan\nLiski\nNizhny Novgorod\nNovomoskovsk\nSmall West Siberian Railway, Novosibirsk\nOrenburg\nPenza\nRostov-Na-Donu\nSankt-Petersburg, Malaya Oktyabrskaya railway\nSvobodny\nTyumen\nUfa\nVladikavkaz\nVolgograd\nChildren's Railway Sakhalin, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk\nYaroslavl\n\n\n=== Slovakia ===\nKo\u0161ice Children's Heritage Railway, Ko\u0161ice\n\n\n=== Turkmenistan ===\nAshgabat\n\n\n=== Ukraine ===\nDnipro\nDonetsk\nKharkiv\nKiev\nLutsk\nLviv\nRivne\nU\u017ehorod\nZaporizhia\n\n\n=== Uzbekistan ===\nJizzakh\nTashkent\n\n\n== See also ==\nRidable miniature railway\nBackyard railroad\nTrain ride\nGarden railway\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChildren's railways of the USSR (in Russian)\nrailways.id.ru (in English)\n[1] (in Hungarian)\n[2] (in Hungarian)",

        "wiki": "Tyumen ( tew-MEN; Russian: \u0422\u044e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c, IPA: [t\u02b2\u0289\u02c8m\u02b2en\u02b2] (listen)) is the largest city and the administrative center of Tyumen Oblast, Russia, located on the Tura River 2,143 kilometers (1,332 mi) east of Moscow.\nTyumen was the first Russian settlement in Siberia. Founded in 1586 to support Russia's eastward expansion, the city has remained one of the most important industrial and economic centers east of the Ural Mountains. Located at the junction of several important trade routes and with easy access to navigable waterways, Tyumen rapidly developed from a small military settlement to a large commercial and industrial city. The central part of Old Tyumen retains many historic buildings from throughout the city's history.\nToday Tyumen is an important business center. It is the transport hub and industrial center of Tyumen Oblast \u2014 an oil-rich region bordering Kazakhstan \u2014 as well as the home of many companies active in Russia's oil and gas industry.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTyumen covers an area of 235 square kilometers (91 sq mi). Its primary geographical feature is the Tura River, which crosses the city from northwest to southeast. The river is navigable downstream of the city. The left bank of the Tura is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills. The Tura is a shallow river with extensive marshlands.\nThe river floods during the snow melting season in the spring. The spring flood usually peaks in the second half of May, when the river becomes 8\u201310 times wider than during the late-summer low water season. The city is protected from flooding by a dike which can withstand floods up to 8 meters (26 ft) high. The highest ever flood water level in Tyumen was 9.15 meters (30.0 ft), recorded in 1979. More recently, in 2007, a water level of 7.76 was recorded. In spring 2005, a flood higher than the critical 8 meters (26 ft) mark was expected, but did not appear.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTyumen has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb) with warm, somewhat humid summers and long, cold winters. The weather in the region is very changeable, and the temperature in town is always higher than in the surrounding area by a few degrees. The town area also attracts more precipitation. The average temperature in January is \u221216.7 \u00b0C (1.9 \u00b0F), with a record low of \u221250 \u00b0C (\u221258 \u00b0F) measured in February 1951. The average temperature in July is +18.6 \u00b0C (65.5 \u00b0F), with a record high of +38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F).\nThe average annual precipitation is 457 millimeters (18.0 in). The wettest year on record was 1943, with 581 millimeters (22.9 in), and the driest was 1917, with only 231 millimeters (9.1 in).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Cossack ataman Yermak Timofeyevich annexed the Tyumen area, originally part of the Siberia Khanate, to the Tsardom of Russia in 1585. Both capitals of the Siberia Khanate, Sibir/Qashliq and Tyumen/Chimgi-Tura (the capital in the 15th century), were completely destroyed. Sibir was never rebuilt, though it gave its name to all concurrent and future lands in North Asia annexed by Russia, but Tyumen was later founded again. On July 29, 1586, Tsar Feodor I ordered two regional commanders, Vasily Borisov-Sukin and Ivan Myasnoy, to construct a fortress on the site of the former Siberian Tatar town of Chingi-Tura (\"city of Chingis\"), also known as Tyumen, from the Turkish and Mongol word for \"ten thousand\" \u2013 tumen.\nTyumen stood on the \"Tyumen Portage\", part of the historical trade route between Central Asia and the Volga region. Various South Siberian nomads had continuously contested control of the portage in the preceding centuries. As a result, Siberian Tatar and Kalmyk raiders often attacked early Russian settlers. The military situation meant that streltsy and Cossack garrisons stationed in the town predominated in the population of Tyumen until the mid-17th century. As the area became less restive, the town began to take on a less military character.\nBy the beginning of the 18th century Tyumen had developed into an important center of trade between Siberia and China in the east and Central Russia in the west. Tyumen had also become an important industrial center, known for leatherworkers, blacksmiths, and other craftsmen. In 1763, 7,000 people were recorded as living in the town.\nIn the 19th century the town's development continued. In 1836, the first steam boat in Siberia was built in Tyumen. In 1862, the telegraph came to the town, and in 1864 the first water mains were laid. Further prosperity came to Tyumen after the construction, in 1885, of the Trans-Siberian Railway. For some years, Tyumen was Russia's easternmost railhead, and the site of transhipment of cargoes between the railway and the cargo boats plying the Tura, Tobol, Irtysh, and Ob Rivers.\nBy the end of the 19th century Tyumen's population exceeded 30,000, surpassing that of its northern rival Tobolsk, and beginning a process whereby Tyumen gradually eclipsed the former regional capital. The growth of Tyumen culminated on August 14, 1944 when the city finally became the administrative center of the extensive Tyumen Oblast.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Russian Civil War in 1917, forces loyal to Admiral Alexander Kolchak and his Siberian White Army controlled Tyumen. However, the city fell to the Red Army on January 5, 1918.\nDuring the 1930s, Tyumen became a major industrial center of the Soviet Union. By the onset of World War II, the city had several well-established industries, including shipbuilding, furniture manufacture, and the manufacture of fur and leather goods.\nWorld War II saw rapid growth and development in the city. In the winter of 1941, twenty-two major industrial enterprises evacuated to Tyumen from the European part of the Soviet Union. These enterprises went into operation the following spring. Additionally, war-time Tyumen became a \"hospital city\", where thousands of wounded soldiers were treated.\nDuring Operation Barbarossa, when it seemed possible that Moscow would fall to the advancing German Army, Tyumen also became a refuge for the body of the Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. Lenin's body was secretly moved from Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow (October 1941) to a hidden tomb located in what is now the Tyumen State Agriculture Academy (former Tyumen Agriculture Institute).\nBetween 1941 and 1945 more than 20,000 Tyumen natives saw action at the front. Almost a third, about 6,000, perished in action (the exact number remains uncertain as official data includes non-local soldiers who died in Tyumen's hospitals).\n\nThe town was affected by the discovery of rich oil- and gas-fields in the Tyumen Oblast in the 1960s.  While most of these lay hundreds of kilometers away, near the towns of Surgut and Nizhnevartovsk, Tyumen was the nearest railway junction and so the city became their supply base while the railway was extended northwards. As the result of this economic and population boom, with tens of thousands of skilled workers arriving from across the Soviet Union between 1963 and 1985, the rapid growth of the city also brought a host of problems. Its social infrastructure was limited and the lack of city planning has resulted in uneven development, with which Tyumen has continued to struggle.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nTyumen is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Tyumensky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Tyumen\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Tyumen is incorporated as Tyumen Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City divisions ===\n\nTyumen is divided into four administrative okrugs: Kalininsky, Leninsky, Tsentralny, and Vostochny.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\n\nThe legislative authority of Tyumen is the City Duma. In addition to legislative activities, the City Duma appoints the Head of the Tyumen City Administration, who is the chief executive officer of the city.\n\n\n=== Oblast government ===\nSince Tyumen is the administrative center of the oblast, all the governing bodies of the oblast are located in the city. They include the elected Legislative Assembly (Duma) of Tyumen Oblast, which also confirms the appointment of the Governor of Tyumen Oblast, who is nominated by the President of Russia.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nTyumen's population grew steadily from the 16th century through the 19th century. However, when the Trans-Siberian Railway arrived at the end of the 19th century, the town's rate of population growth was greatly boosted. Tyumen rapidly became the largest town in the region, with about 30,000 inhabitants by the beginning of the 20th century. Tyumen again experienced rapid population growth with the coming of World War II. The evacuation of workers from factories in central Russia in 1941 more than doubled Tyumen's population to 150,000.In the 1960s, the discovery of the rich oil and gas fields in Western Siberia caused the city's population, which had not been forecast to exceed 250,000 inhabitants that decade, to swell to almost half a million. After the growth of the 1960s, a period of population stability lasted until 1988, when economic depression hit the Soviet Union. The city's population in 1989 was 476,869, according to the census of that year. However, within five or six years Tyumen was again a major economic center with a rising population. By 2002, Tyumen's population had risen to 510,719. Further population growth (mainly due to migration and the incorporation of surrounding settlements) meant that by 2008 regional government statistics put Tyumen's population at 588,600 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nWhile the population of Tyumen includes people from over a hundred different ethnicities, most belong to one of the following ethnicities:\n\nRussians\nUkrainians\nSiberian Tatars\nAzerbaijanis\nArmenians\nTajiks\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAs of 2009, there are over ten operational Orthodox temples (both newly built and historical), two mosques (both newly built), one synagogue, and one Roman Catholic church in Tyumen.\n\n\n==== Orthodox Christianity ====\nWhile the state religion of the Russian Empire was Orthodoxy, this religion historically prevailed in Tyumen. In 1616, Trinity Monastery was established in Tyumen by Nifont of Kazan. In 1709\u20131711, this monastery was rebuilt in stone by the order of Filofey Leshchinsky, the first Metropolitan of Siberia. In 1761, the Tyumen Religious School was established. Overall, from 1708 to 1885, twelve stone Orthodox churches of different size, and two monasteries were constructed in Tyumen.\nDuring Soviet times, two of the churches were completely destroyed, but the rest remained. As of 2008, most of them are accessible and operating. Some operational churches are also under restoration. Tyumen Religious School was reopened in 1997.\n\n\n==== Other religions ====\nDespite the predominance of Orthodoxy, Catholic churches as well as mosques and synagogues were also built. However, only one Catholic church remains preserved. The Tyumen Mosque was completely destroyed, but its reconstruction on the same site caused controversy. The Tyumen synagogue collapsed in 2000, but was reconstructed on the same site. At the start of the 20th century, there was a strong Old Believers community in Tyumen.\nAll of the aforementioned religions operate cultural centers in Tyumen. There are also several other religious bodies with a few adherents in Tyumen.Tyumen Trinity Monastery was built with special permission of Peter the Great. At the time, the construction of stone buildings outside Saint Petersburg was prohibited. The Church of Savior Uncreated was visited by Crown prince Alexandr (later Alexander II) during his Siberian tour.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTyumen is an important service center for the gas and oil industries in Russia. Due to its advantageous location at the crossing of the motor, rail, water and air ways and its moderate climate Tyumen was an ideal base town for servicing the oil and gas industry of the West Siberia.  As a result, today Tyumen is a center of industry, science, culture, education and medicine. Many large oil and gas companies such as Gazprom, LUKoil, Gazpromneft and Shell have their representative offices in Tyumen.\nThere are numerous factories, engineering companies, oil industry service companies (KCA DEUTAG and Schlumberger), design institutes, shipyard and other oil servicing companies located in Tyumen. Schwank, market leader for industrial heaters, has its subsidiary, SibSchwank, in Tyumen, holding market shares of about 25%. UTair is also based in Tyumen.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Railway ====\n\nTyumen railway station was built in 1885. Currently the station administratively belongs to the Tyumen Division of Sverdlovskaya Rail Road. The station is located in the center of the city. At the regional level, the station services three directions to Yekaterinburg, Omsk, and Tobolsk. The railroad to Yekaterinburg has been electrified since 1980. At the international level, the station services passage to (Trans-Siberian Railway): Poland, Germany, China, Mongolia, and Azerbaijan.\nAdditional stations within the city territory include: Tyumen North, Tyumen yard, Voynovka yard.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nPublic transportation in Tyumen is dominated by both municipal bus services and by numerous private operators (marshrutkas), which account for nearly a third of all transport capacity. The city's bus fleet is in process of modernization and expansion, with newly acquired Russian buses replacing the severely aged Soviet models.\nTyumen is a major hub for intercity bus service, centered on the bus terminal, which was constructed in 1972, and greatly expanded between 2006 and 2008.\n\n\n==== Air transportation ====\n\nTyumen is served by the international Roschino Airport located 13 kilometres (8 miles) west of the city. In addition Plekhanovo Airport is in the area. The Roschino airport has permits to handle the following types of aircraft: Tu-154, Tu-134, An-12, An-24, An-26, Yak-40, Yak-42, IL-18, L-410, B-737, B-767, B-757, IL-86, IL-76, ATR-42, ATR-72, HS-125. The airport also has a permit to handle all types of helicopters. The airstrip is capable of handling large freight aircraft such as the An-22 Antaeus.\nThe city has a regular service to a large number of Russian towns, including, Moscow (9 flights a day), St. Petersburg, and Samara. There are also weekly or biweekly flights to the following international locations: Baku, Erevan, Khujand, and Tashkent.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTyumen is divided by the Tura River, the Tyumneka River, and the Trans-Siberian Railroad, creating several isolated zones. Ten bridges, one footbridge, seven flyovers, and five foot crossings connect these zones.In addition, the road network was planned before the fall of the Soviet Union, and in its current state, it can operate normally only in the scheme which includes public transportation only. Compact planning of the city center prevents expansion of main roads; congestion coming from the city periphery moves slower and slower as it approaches the town center. To date, the road network serves about 200% above planned capacity, which leads to numerous traffic jams and high accident rates.\nSince 2002, city and regional authorities have undertaken numerous initiatives to improve Tyumen's road network, but due to the continued growth of private automobile ownership rates, these efforts have only had short term positive effects. To date, a complex transport infrastructure reconstruction project is being directed by Regional Administration. In January 2015, a paid parking program and prohibition of vehicle access for non-residents began.\nTotal length of the city roads: 925 kilometres (575 miles) (Jan 2009).\nTotal number of cars: 380,000 of 1,176,441 total in Tyumen Oblast (as of March 2015), previous count 151,000 (Jan. 2008)\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nHistorically, Tyumen occupied a small area on the high bank of the Tura River around the foundation site of the city. The city consisted of one and two-storey wooden buildings, surrounded by a number of villages. With time, the territory of the city was developed and extended by including the surrounding villages.\nWhen viewed from above, present-day Tyumen appears to be a collection of low-rise towns with occasional clusters of tall buildings. Two areas of the city, Yamskaya Sloboda and Republic Street are noted for their historic character. These areas are dominated by old brick and wooden merchant houses and buildings, with the occasional intrusion of mid-century Soviet low-rise buildings.\n\nBukharskaya Sloboda is a historic residential area on the low bank of the Tura river. This area is mostly made up of very old one and two-storey wooden buildings. The area is part of the Historical Centre on the city and has a mostly Muslim population. Low bank Dormitories is a cluster of standard 9-storey buildings was built on reclaimed land east of Bukharskaya Sloboda \u2013 Zareka and Vatutina.\n\nThe area to the east of the historical town centre built between 1948 and 1978 and is mostly 4 and 5-storey buildings. Earlier buildings in this area have individual designs, but the later buildings have a rectangular style. This area contains most of the political and business activities of the town.\n\nThe modern area near the center of the town was built over demolished wooden houses and industrial areas. This area contains mostly tall buildings and is a mix of the dormitory areas and business centres.\n\nThe Old Dormitories area features standard 5-storey blocks of flats constructed in the 1960s and 1970s at the west and east extremities of the city. However, today this area is actually in the town centre. While there are almost no variety in the area's architecture, this area has the most greenery in the city and the best social infrastructure.\n\nThe New dormitories area features clusters of standard tall buildings constructed after 1980 at the south and south-east edges of Tyumen. This area is considered to be the worst place to live in the city. The area is remote, badly planned, and has very poor social infrastructure.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nTyumen is not characterized by any particular architectural style. The town was built without planning for decades and because of that its architecture is an eclectic mix of buildings of different styles and eras.\nTyumen's nickname is the Capital of Villages because the most of its territory is built up by lumber houses. Many of the wooden buildings located in the historical part of the city are considered culturally valuable.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nTyumen has many cinemas and clubs. The city has had a Drama and Comedy Theater since 1858. There is a professional puppet show and the Angazhement Youth Theater. The Tyumen Music Hall is one of the most common venues for performances by Russian and foreign artists. Tyumen offers a great variety of cuisine in its numerous restaurants and bars. Annual events in the town include the Student Spring Music show and Day of The City Show.\n\n\n=== Literature and film ===\nA writer closely associated with the city is the children's writer Vladislav Krapivin. Author Mikhail M. Prishvin spent his youth in Tyumen, and Viktor L. Strogalschikov also lives in the city. Producer Konstantin V. Odegov was born and studied in Tyumen.\n\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\n\nMuseums and art galleries in Tyumen include the Tyumen Museum of Local Lore, the Tyumen Museum of the Fine Arts, Museum of Kolokolnikov estate and the Medical History Museum.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe town has its own philharmonic orchestra and the Tyumen Music hall hosts performances.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMany Soviet and Russian sportsmen started their careers in Tyumen youth sport, including Soviet cyclists Sergey Uslamin, Yury Korotkikh, and Oleg Polovnikov. Olympic biathlete siblings Anastasiya Kuzmina (n\u00e9e Shipulina) and Anton Shipulin were born and raised in the Tyumen area. The Tyumen Biathlon complex hosted a World Cup race series for the first time in March 2018.\nTyumen has a national level ice hockey team, soccer team and futsal team.

He was the first senior OGPU officer to defect to the West (1930); his revelatory books led to massive arrests of Soviet intelligence assets across the Near East and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAgabekov was born in Ashkhabad, the Russian Empire, in 1895 to an Armenian family.\n\n\n=== Red Army ===\nGeorges Agabekov fought in the Russian army from 1914 to 1916 during World War I.  At the end of 1916, he was sent to the Tashkent Praporshchiks school. Following the 1917 October revolution, he joined the Red Guard in March 1918.\n\n\n=== Cheka ===\nHe joined the Bolshevik Party in 1920; soon after, he joined the Cheka.  He partook in the Red Terror at Ekaterinburg and in the suppressing of a peasant revolt in Tyumen.\n\n\n=== OGPU ===\nAs Agabekov could speak Persian and Turkish, he was brought to Moscow in October 1921 to join the Oriental Section of the Cheka.  In 1922, he was dispatched to Tashkent to work for Yakov Peters. While in Turkestan, according to his own account, he played a key role in locating the camp of Enver Pasha, then Basmachi leader, near Denau (now in Surxondaryo Province of Uzbekistan), thus laying the groundwork for the routing of Enver's troops and his assassination in early August 1922.\nIn April 1924, he was posted to the Soviet mission in Kabul, where he spied under diplomatic cover.\nAt the end of 1926, Agabekov was posted in Tehran as rezident of the OGPU Foreign Branch in Persia, where he was successful in obtaining foreign powers' secret codes, recruiting agents and fomenting animosity against Britain amongst the local tribal leaders; however, he failed in the task of dispatching back to the USSR the defector Boris Bazhanov, Joseph Stalin's former assistant.In April 1928, back in Moscow, Agabekov was promoted to the position of chief of the OGPU Near Eastern Section.\n\n\n=== In Constantinople. Defection ===\nAt the end of October 1929, Agabekov arrived from Odessa in Constantinople as \"illegal\" rezident in Turkey, where he replaced the Trotskyite Yakov Blumkin (alias Zhivoi) executed in Moscow shortly afterward. Like Blumkin before him, Agabekov travelled to Turkey on a Persian passport, posing as a wealthy ethnic Armenian merchant under the name of Nerses Ovsepyan. Apart from Turkey, Blumkin had started to set up \"illegal\" spy networks in such countries as Syria, Palestine, Hejaz and Egypt. According to Agabekov, prior to 1930, Turkey was viewed by OGPU as a friendly power pursuant to the Russo-Turkish Treaty of Moscow, yet cooperation offers on the part of Turkey's police and intelligence were declined. Mikhail Trilisser, chief of the OGPU Foreign Branch (1922\u20131930), whose patronage Agabekov enjoyed, envisioned Constantinople as a base of Soviet espionage activity for the entire Near East.In his book The Storm Petrels: The First Soviet Defectors, 1928\u20131938 (1977), British intelligence officer and journalist, Gordon Brook-Shepherd, maintained that Agabekov's defection to France in June 1930 was caused solely by the fact that he had fallen in love with an under-age English girl, Isabel Streater, who taught him English. However, Agabekov's own account implies political and ideological motives, as he criticises what he saw as the degeneration of the revolution, the 'bureaucratisation' of the party, the abuses of the apparatus, the lack of democracy within the party and Stalin's autocratic rule.Shortly after his arrival in Paris, in August 1930, the French authorities expelled Agabekov to Brussels, Belgium, where he lived under his original name of Arutyunov. There, he finally succeeded in establishing cooperation with the British and in marrying Isabel.\n\n\n=== Publication of OGPU ===\nThe publication of Agabekov's English-language book OGPU: The Russian Secret Terror in 1931, led to sweeping arrests of hundreds of Soviet agents and sympathisers in Persia as well as other Near Eastern countries; a sharp deterioration of Moscow's relations with Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h ensued. He also published 2 Russian-language books in Berlin, which have an autobiographical element. Amongst other things, Agabekov said that starting from 1929, the OGPU Foreign Branch actively used Armenian clergy both from the USSR and abroad for the purposes of espionage.\n\n\n=== Assassination ===\nHe was believed to have been killed by Soviet agents in the Pyrenees in 1937, after a series of unsuccessful attempts on his life. \nHowever, according to the 1997 memoir attributed to Pavel Sudoplatov, his assassination was perpetrated by a retired Turkish officer in Paris and organised by Aleksandr M. Korotkov (ru), who subsequently became deputy chief of the Foreign Intelligence.A diverging account of the defector's elimination was provided by Ilya Grigoryevich Dzhirkvelov in his 1987 memoirs . Agabekov was at the time serving the Romanian secret police, who had provided him with a fortified house and a bodyguard near Bucharest. In the summer of 1939, a man going by the name of Vladimir Sanakoyev phoned Agabekov and declared that he had been sent to murder him, but did not wish to complete his assignment. A confidential meeting was organised, ostensibly to work out a plan to deceive Moscow, but which gave Sanakoyev the opportunity he needed to approach his victim. Dzhirkvelov claims that this version was borne out by the material in Agabekov\u2019s file, and that it points to considerable discrepancies with Gordon Brook-Shepherd\u2019s writings.\n\n\n== Writings ==\n\u0413. \u041f. \u0423. \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430.

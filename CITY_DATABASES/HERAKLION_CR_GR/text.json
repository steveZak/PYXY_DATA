        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "Good museum, especially in combination with the Knossos palast. Under 25 years you don\u2019t have to pay",
          "If you are at all interested in ancient greek history, visiting this museum is a must in my opinion. It is very well labeled and the exhibits are well presented. The building and the exhibitions rooms are very modern. We had only one hour there, which was not enough, but better",
          "On just two stories near the central place in Heraklion you get to meet 2.000 years of history, with a couple of very famous pieces, a lot of important originals, in a very modern and bright architecture and with a lot of information. Even if you have only one hour of spare",
          "We visited the museum on our day at Heraklion. It\u2019s a nice set up with a lot of ancious stuff like coins, plates, jewelry, sculptures and old history I would not go there with small kids as it\u2019s more like an \u201cadult thing\u201d and you need to be interested in history But we liked",
          "Wonderful collection, a must see in Crete together with the Jnossos palace compelx site, very rich collection, prepare from history",
          "Crete is a credle of civilization. The museum offers good overview on the history of this amazing island and is definitely great addition to your visit in Heraklion.",
          "Excellent and comprehensive museum. Allow at least 2 hours to enjoy the exhibits. Covid safe,masks and no of visitorsper room closely observed. Well worth a visit",
          "Even though my husband claimed he had seen enough pottery for a long time he enjoyed the exhibits as well. This museum presents a look into 7000 years of Crete civilization and is a must to visit! We spent almost 2 hours there because so many items are worth to be looked at",
          "We were amazed at the quality and amount of exhibits on display, in this museum. Artefacts in the region of 4000 years old the designs of which almost seemed so modern...shows what we borrow and take inspiration from the past. It does feel a long walk around on a hot day but",
          "We bought the combo tickets for Knossos Palace and this museum which I would recommend anyone with an interest in archeology and history to visit. Amazing collection of items in chronological order, some of which had been made around 5000 BC (pretty mind blowing). Excellent",
          "WARNING!!! IF YOU BUY ONLINE, THEN PRINT YOUR TICKETS OUT BEFORE GOING! I purchased online a combi ticket with Knossos and hired a car. Started at Knossos and went around no problem. Was taking pictures and suddenly my phone screen went blank. I could not access anything on my",
          "A museum you can't miss! So rich collections, so many iconic master pieces, specially for those who like archeology. I suggest to make it in the afternoon, after visiting Knossos palace (and I suggest the combo ticket which is so valuable)",
          "Excellent set up - lots and lots to see so good to have a read a guide to get you to the key exhibits",
          "Nothing to say apart that the collections are splendid and varied. Make sense with nearly 4000 years history. About details, do not book cut the line tickets on the tripadvisor as it is expensive and worthless. Had to call the operator to get the tickets and the desk lady",
          "It is worth a trip to see so much and if for nothing else but see the 3000 year old bee pendent. This old Chao found it mesmerising.",

          "This museum had good, although time consuming, COVID protocols in place. When we finally got to see the exhibitions they were very detailed and there were a lot of them. Do allow plenty of time to get round them all. We possibly made the mistake of spending too much time looking",
          "It's an archeological museum like an other at an other ancient archeological site. Please do not missunderstand: you will see exhibits, of wich you neuer thought people 6000 years ago would have used it. But we've missed anything about the usage, the traditional live, the urban",

          "Good museum with a simple layout focusing on displaying as many of the Minoan (and later) artifacts as possible. I'd say its aimed at adults, not a lot for kids to see or do. Not a lot of interpretive art or reconstruction, you are left to visit Knossos for that. In mid August",

          "The Heraklion Archeological Museum has an excellent collection of artefacts from the Minoan (ca. 1700 BC) civilisation which predates that of classical Greece. The collection includes pottery, jewellery, coins, mosaics, frescoes, statues and weapons and is the ideal complement",

          "For antiquarians, the Athens museum should be the best. But I personally was thrilled more by the massive Heraklion Museum--and be prepared to spend at least three hours here--for several reasons. First, Knossos, well worth a visit, was pretty-well Disney-ed up 110 years ago by",
          "Tons of interesting artifacts from Neolithic through Roman periods with good explanations in English. And the snake goddess! We spent over 3 hours and could have honestly stayed longer but the museum was closing.",
          "A wonderfull museum of all the artifacts recovered from Knossos and other locations in Crete. Easy to find at the east edge of the old city and medium size venue with all the displays well shown and explained. Includes the not to be missed Phaistos disc. Head phone and guded",
          "One of the greatest collections that I have seen from a local museum so far. The history of this island zipped in there \ud83d\ude04",
          "a wide variety of artefacts, beautifully presented and notated. Well worth visiting. The building itself was worth a visit.",
          "Spent 3 hours here, very well presented and enlightening, amazing. Then took a taxi up the road and spent 30 minutes at Knossos Palace site,.. that says it all really.",
          "A beautiful museum, with a wonderful collection! You can really learn a lot about the early civilizations! Spacious, clean and with a friendly staff! You must visit!",
          "A must visit when in Crete. All exhibits are amazing. Primarly from the Minoan Civilization period. Honestly one of world\u2019s best museums.",
          "Visit this amazing museum after your visit to the knossis site to getter understand some of the stunning artefacts displayed. Beautifully displayed visiting this museum gives one real insight into the Minoan civilization. Definitely recommend.",
          "The museum had the entire 2nd floor closed the day we visited. Yes, it was posted but there definitely should have been a discount price that day. All the Creten frescoes and Roman pieces weren't available for viewing. It was a short visit for the rainy day we stopped in on. The",
          "To think we almost missed this one. At the end of our trip we had overdosed on museums and almost didn't see this. Out guide at the Palace of Knossos recommended that we not miss this and she was right! Absolutely stunning exhibit items and more meaningful after having viewed",
          "Extensive collection from prehistoric, Minoan to Roman. We went on a guided tour arranged by our cruise ship and saw the highlights of the extensive collection. Not to be missed attraction if one is interested in the history of Crete.",
          "All the history of the Minoan civilazation is presented in a unique way. Commerce, war, art, every day life, religion and burial customs.",
          "Modern and well presented. Cafe not open on the day we visited. Busy even out of the main holiday season.",
          "New museum, great location, \u00e0 LOT to see, all the history in front of your eyes. A must see, takes less than 2 hours to look around some of the most famous antiques.",
          "It is not like you have a choice if you are in Heraklion. You visit the Temple of Knossos and all the original stuff was moved to the museum. But I bet the really awesome stuff went to London with Evans. So to sum up the experience. This place is clean and well maintained but I",
          "This museum has a collection that dates back several thousand years. The displays explain the ancient history of Crete starting with the Minoans. A walk down history lane.",
          "If you plan to visit just one museum on Crete, choose this one! It is extremely interesting - we learned a lot about the cultures living on and forming Crete som 3-4000 years ago. There are very many finds from Knossos and other cretan cultures. Should you have the opportunity,",
          "We were only able to see the highlights of the Museum, but it was all wonderful and well displayed. There is so much to see and it is organised so you can get a taste of different developments of time.",
          "A wealth of exquisite objects beautifully displayed. Allow a whole morning, afternoon or even the whole day to fully enjoy this museum. Definitely a must!",
          "Well over 10 centuries of super interesting Minoan cultural information. Loads of history in this place, and at 6 euros it's not a bad price either. Check it out while you're in Heraklion before you go to Knossos.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. It was easy to find and well sign posted. Security was tight but I was quite happy not dragging my bag around with me. I found the layout easy to navigate and the information easily accessible in that there were plenty of English translation",
          "There is a lot to see here but a combined ticket with Knossos (one visit each - valid three days) is extremely good value and it is worth spending time on the exhibits of particular interest rather than try and see everything",
          "Hi all, Sorry I know my title seems a bit over the top but I've been to a lot of museums and really love Heraklion archeological museum,not only have they a massive and well-preserved/revelant collection but the layout is the Best I ever saw. We've been there with a friend",
          "This large museum has well documented written information in Greek and English to educate the viewer of the historical era the displayed artifacts are from. The number of items in the collection is massive, and could take up to a couple hours to view if you are interested in",
          "This really is a must see. Ensure that you have allotted enough time. I really enjoyed the chronological layout of the different rooms. The written guides introducing a room and the details of the objects really helped understand this most fascinating epoc of Grecian history",
          "Excellent layout in chronological order and all well displayed and labelled. Would definetly recommend a visit.",
          "Very modern building, very good explanations. The display is on two floors. There is a nice outside area with a gorgeous view of the city from a terrace. A must when in Heraklion.",
          "We visited this museum as we wanted to see the artefacts from Knossos which we had visited earlier that day. There is plenty to see and the displays have information in English which is helpful. For adults who are interested in the history of the artefacts it is a great museum,",
          "Having visited the archaeological site in the morning it was interesting to visit this museum to see so many of the artifacts found at the Palace. Would recommend having a guide to make the most of it",
          "After visiting Knossos we also visited the museum to see all the things our guide in Knossos was referring to. Many things to see if a remarkable period.",
          "I've had the fortune to visit the Heraklion Archaeological Museum twice now and hope to get to visit again! The collection and displays are incredible. I could spend hours looking at the highlights and also every item in the museum is exquisite.",
          "Look for the model of the Palace of Knossos to see the sheer size of the place. There are many different exhibits in this museum and it is well worth it to take your time to see all that is included.",
          "Well worth a visit! An incredible amount of artefacts on display. Visit here before going to Knossos as it will help to identify certain aspects.",
          "Very good museum to see lots of ancient Crete art: lots of pots, jewels, figurines, weapons, sarcophagus, wall paintings. Very modern layout, very clean, a proper museum. Recommended to buy the tickets when doing the joint visit with Knossos palace as it is only \u20ac1 additional.",
          "We loved this museum, great explanations in English and Greek, well laid out, you walk through time as the museum rooms go from the oldest ancient artifacts to the more recent ones. It was so neat to read about and see the everything. It's amazing how advanced they were, their",
          "This was a great thing to so after spending the morning at Knossos Palace. Their collection was beautifully displayed and curated. We were sorry some of the rooms upstairs were closed. A must see when Heraklion.",
          "Whether traveling with family or not, the museums is a spectacular place to visit. Due to the high volume of the exhibits we would recommend a guided tour so you will not miss all the extraordinary details and the historical facts of the ancient history of Crete",
          "Great museum, most items are well laid out and there is interpretation. A woman goes around cleaning the glass as soon as someone has gone near an exhibit which isn't very nice for the guests to inhale all the cleaning fluid! But definitely worth a visit",
          "Great Museum, especially compared to other Greek museums. The exhibits are labeled and ordered for a nice visit",
          "Truely amazing exhibits nicely set out & shown to great effect. To think that most of the exhibits are potentially 4000 years old shows how advanced & capable the Minoan people were. When we visited there was a queue to get in & through security, but overall it was pretty easy",
          "This must be on of the best museums I have ever visited. Displays are well catalogued with information in Greek and English. Starts with prehistoric Crete and move closer to the present. Highlights are the reconstruction of Knossos, the bull head and the goddess holding snakes.",
          "We drove trough old ruins for a few days Knossos, Gortyna, Phaistos, Agia Triada, Tylissos. So on the third day from Knossos (we bought a combo ticket Knossos-Museum), we found time to visit the museum. It was so much more meaningful to look at the artefacts, because we already",
          "Walked there from the port comfortably. Cost was only EUR16 for a combination ticket including Knossos Palace. The museum is packed with exhibited items - about 15 rooms full. You could spend hours looking through the Minoan artifacts. Well documented and signed in English.",
          "I was overwhelmed by the well organized and comprehensive collection in the fairly new museum on Crete. I rivals the Greece Archaeological Museum in Athens. It is close to the City center and would suggest you plan on 2-3 hours for your visit. You won't be disappointed.",
          "This museum is spectauclarly laid out.......beginning in the late Stone Age and moving up through the age of the Minoans, and finishing in the Classical age. But it is the Minoan artifacts that are just overwhelmingly beautiful, abundant, marvelously described and laid out so",
          "I loved the exhibits in this museum - yes, the staff could learn to be more courteous and less like guards, but considering the priceless objects that they are \"guarding\" perhaps it is understandable. You have to be keen on archaeology to appreciate the finds - I went twice as",
          "Loved the museum with much art work as well as artifacts. This has been my favorite museum so far in Greece. You can purchase a dual ticket for Knossis",
          "It\u2019s one of the best museums in the world. The perfect introduction to Minoan culture. Thank You!!!!!!",
          "We went four times to finish it all. I admit that we look at everything and read it all. Well worth the time if you want to see everything. Sometimes after three or four hours I get museum overload and have to have time to process. There is so much in the museum starting",
          "Fantastic museum with some really interesting pieces. The thing that let it down was the continuous hissing and shhing from the museum attendants towards particularly small children. Even more annoying when they then spoke amongst themselves loudly. I wasn\u2019t aware you had to be",
          "As a tourist experience, Knossos is both wonderful and terrible at the same time. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have visited this museum first. It is superbly laid out (starting from the oldest to the 'newest'), with lots of explanatory material which is always",
          "This is a must see - it has all the treasures of the Knossos Palace and so much more. Beautifully laid out, lots of information. Go early because the tour buses come later and it is sometimes hard to see things or contemplate the exhibits with guides rattling on!",
          "We didn't manage to see all of the exhibits in two to three hours, the dual entry ticket with Knossos ticket is very good value at 16 euros against 10 and 15 respectively, it's valid for three days, we tried to go back to the museum after visiting Knossos and found that while",
          "Pottery, paintings, mosaics, sculptures, old metalwork (Swords, coins and such) You are not allowed to bring in any liquids that may damage anything, after a tourist sprayed a painting with perfume and damaged it. You must check in anything that is banned at the cloakroom just",
          "Fascinating collection over 2 floors of Minoan history and artifacts. Fully refurbished exhibition halls and excellent display cabinets. Great supporting detail. If you visit Knossos you need to visit the museum. Well worth it.",
          "We went to the museum on the first day of our visit before going to the Knossos archeological site. Unlike Knossos, which was quite disappointimg with its deceiving restoration works, the Archeological museum was great. It gives precise historical background of the Minoan and",
          "There is a great vast amount of artifacts at this museum. She much is unknown about the minoan people that thrived at this location more than 3,600 years ago. It\u2019s amazing how advanced the people were and what they had accomplished. Anyone that goes to Crete must visit this",
          "Spent 1.5 hours in the. Museum, a stunning collection, visit before you go to Knossos. Some of the artefacts take your breath away, clean toilets and a good museum shop.",
          "Nice museum with a great collection in out and indoor displays. Tells a lot about Crete's history. We had a Nice day.",
          "Not 100%sure about restorations but glad it is there so you get a feel of the magnificance of a palace that is 3600 years old. Do go at 8 sharp to avoid the cruise ship tour buses..or maybe later in the day. We got there at 9 and too many tours. Anyways site is large so you can",
          "Many of the important Cretan relics are at this museum. The layout is logical, but the text on the walls are too small, or, worse yet, partially missing. Overall, it is a must-see if you wish to understand Crete\u2019s history",
          "Thus helped get rid the bitter experience if the concrete Knossos. The layout and variety of exhibits was brilliant. The intuitive and spacious layout made navigation easy.",
          "2nd best in Greece, after the Archeological Museum of Athens. Far more interesting than the Acropolis Museum of Athens. You don't even need a guide to visit. All you have to do is to read the explanation of the exhibits.",
          "The museum is in the centre of Heraklion. It\u2019s treasures are beautifully displayed and the layout is explained very well. We spent a fascinating 3 hours there.",
          "Went in arround 10 am. ..... Just so much to see from the earliest times of Greek and especially the Minoan civilisations for anybody with any interest in history and/or archaeology ..... surprised to find had been in there for nearly FOUR hours ....... I think that says it",
          "Having visited many of the Minoan archaeological sites around Crete which point out that all the artefacts discovered are stored at this museum, it was time to put everything together and see the discoveries. Not a necessity, but seeing one site probably helps make sense of the",
          "The richest, in exhibits, archaeological museum in the world for the greatest known civilisation that has ever existed on earth.",
          "An absolute must. We spent 3 hrs. Late afternoon till closing. Very close to our hotel, infinity boutique hotel. Amazing after going to knosses that morning. Seeing artifacts 4000BC.",
          "All of the major archeological finds from the palace of Knossos are housed in this museum. The Minoan civilization was extraordinary and the presentation of the pieces in this museum will convince you how extraordinary they were.",
          "A great place to see artifacts from history many of which have not been officially catalogued. A cool and spacious area to wander around and pass the time. Fascinating stories in every room . Just go,stroll round and enjoy the experience",
          "Recommended. The museum can be visited via an extra euro add on from a Knossos trip so good value. Lots of pots and jewelry and the famous Pareus disk.",
          "The Museum is well worth seeing. The collection exposed is beautiful and interesting also for an amateur. The posters in English explains the artefacts in an understandable way and adds meat to the bones when you visit the Palace in Knossos. If you are planning for your end",
          "We purchased a joint Knossos and archeological museum ticket so we didn\u2019t have to queue to buy one. We did have to queue to have our bags scanned, which was a bit frustrating (one scanner and LOTS of people waiting). Once inside there is a cloakroom if you don\u2019t want to carry",
          "The displays are arranged chronologically by room. This really helps in getting clearer picture of the ancient history of the island. Besides the famous artifacts like the Phaestos Disk I liked the wooden reconstruction of the Palace of Knossos. At the actual site I had a hard",
          "This is a one of the best little museums I've visited. I was entranced by the selection of pottery, small seals,statuary and other relics in this museum. I found it well curated, with good English descriptions. If you are interested in all the minutiae of ancient Minoan life,",
          "The Archaeological Museum of Heraklion is a must see in Crete . The volume of visitors inside the museum further confirms the huge interest in the Minoan art and culture this museum has on display . 1-3 hours are needed if you really want to see all the exhibits especially when",
          "It was hard to get the age of all these remarkable treasures fixed in ones head. They are SO old! What an extraordinary collection of artifacts in amazingly good condition. i am not a great one for dusty museums, but this one was mind-blowingly spectacular! The gold jewelry was",
          "Despite crowds from cruise boats, the visit went smoothly. The collection is astonishing, and beautifully curated. The building is impressive, and leads you through ancient history with clear and helpfulmexplanations. A great museum.",
          "This place contains everything of value that has been excavated in the island in the last two hundred years. Very well presented.",
          "It's nice to get inside from the heat... But it's nice and lot of Greek history. And if you are lucky you will see maybe 1 or 2 vases. It's good place to go to, and worth it",
          "We visited the museum after a visit to the Palace of Knossos with a little trepidation as we were disappointed with the Palace ruins and information about the history of the site. In my opinion a visit to the museum should be before the Palace of Knossos to fully understand this",
          "After a visit to Knossos Palace this museum is a must where all the details of the Minoan civilization come alive. See art, jewelry, pottery, religious artifacts and burial coffins. Amazing stuff from an ancient civilization. The museum is not large and you can complete a visit",
          "Wonderful collection of Minoan material, very well displayed and with a lot of explanatory English text. Fascinating pottery, implements and tools, stunning jewellery. Absolutely well worth seeing; we certainly learned a lot. An enormous amount to see - two visits would be great",
          "Too much See twice on several days is a good option Amazing Amazing Amazing Need to see it\u2019s the root of European no WORLD civilization! The museum has stuff from more before Christ then 2019 years.... Really excellent Value of entrance is 10\u20ac but free last weekend of",
          "You can see there many things. Great who intrested at history. Also good for kids, there are some entertainment for them. Minuses that some things are not working and the price is 7,5e",
          "Nice and inexpensive during the off season. No crowds and exhibition s show well. Very informative, too.",
          "It's a museum....what else do I say. Contains some of the artifacts from Knossos (plus lots of other stuff), and provides history of the area. I believe there was a discount if you bought a combined ticket for the archaeological site. Public bus to the site leaves from just",
          "You should of course visit the archeological site of Knossos, but to understand and get the context: This museum is fantastic. Beautiful and intrigueing objects, a lot to learn. If I had to choose between this and seeing the Palace of Knossos: My first priority would defnitely",
          "Excellent museum. Not too long to visit, but the exhibits are all worth the time to see. Try to arrive early before the large tour groups. 1100 should do it.",
          "The Heraklion Archeological Museum was one of the most pleasant surprises of our visit to Crete. The museum is beautiful, well designed, well laid out, and has an amazing collection of Minoan artifacts. All the displays had full descriptions in both Greek and English. Also, the",
          "Bought as part of the Knossos ticket,this museum houses artifacts found at Knossos and other sites across the island. Well worth a visit if your a history buff.",
          "Well organized and informative. Only complaint is there is so much at some point I did not want to see another pot or sculpture.",
          "Great collection of Minoan piece of arts. The visit us definitely complementary to Knossos palace since most of pieces found there are displayed herr! Also good coverage of Greek Roman and bizantine history",
          "Absolute 5 stars on a Saturday if you kick it off before 0830. We spent three hours and could have easily spent longer. So much to see, and very well laid out and informative ... then the bus loads of cruise-ship tourists arrive, clearly on pack-it-all-in timelines in guided",
          "This is in the heart of Heraklion so combine it with visiting the town centre. The museum is a modern facility with plenty of space to see the huge number of exhibits from through the ages. It\u2019s the only place to see the original wall frescoes from Knossos too. You get a very",
          "Incredibly informative displays and clearly treasured and precious; beautiful artefacts of interest and provide quite amazing insight into the civilisation - if it\u2019s a guided tour, be careful that it\u2019s not rushed as there is so much to see and you are in danger of \u2018skipping\u2019",
          "Our guide escorted us around the museum pointing out the most interesting exhibits. The frescoes were amazing as was the pottery.",
          "There can\u2019t be many places that cover the consequences and artefacts of such a long period of human history, or of so many different epochs and cultures. This museum really is everything you might expect and more and, whether or not you also make a parallel visit to Knossos or",
          "Excellent museum. Great place to discover the Minoan civilization. Fascinating place! Have at least 2 hours to see the place. You can buy the tickets of Knoss",
          "We only decided to go to this museum at the last minute and were really glad that we did not miss it. The exhibits are beautifully displayed, well explained and in fact the whole museum is a bit of a work of art in itself. We loved it.",
          "Small so easy to get around. Interesting exhibits. What we expected. Walked straight past it, whilst trying to find it.",
          "It is really worth to get the combined ticket for Knossos Palace and this museum for 1\u20ac extra, instead of the 10\u20ac you would pay to visit it. Around 1.5, 2h is enough for a visit. Well organized museum with an excellent collection.",
          "We spent the whole afternoon here as there was so much to see, with incredible artefacts and displays. It stays open until 8pm so there is time to do both Knossos Palace and the museum on the same day - although the joint ticket is valid for 3 days so you don\u2019t have to see them",
          "The main reason I came to Heraklion was to visit this museum. The building is nothing much, the cafe was closed, the gift shop is boring BUT the collection is incredible. Took me 4 hours as it was just so interesting. Guides you along the timeline of the civilisations and how",
          "Once you have seen the semi-reconstructed palace, you need to see the actual artifacts that were used as the basis for the reconstruction. I saw many artifacts that I have seen pictures of in textbooks and articles. The museum is not large and covers the Minoan civilization",
          "I visited this museum as part of the Knossos palace tour and our guide, Suki, was brilliant. Definitely recommended",
          "We visited the museum and it\u2019s not very big, however had very ancient and interesting artifacts. They are open until 8pm.",
          "I've been to many museums all over Europe, and this would easily be in my list of must sees. It is a treasure trove of finds from Knossos and other sites. The preservation of some artefacts is extraordinary, beautiful statues that pre-date almost all other finds outside of",
          "Amazing treasures from the Minoan Palace at Knossos are displayed in this museum . Beautiful ceramics ! One of the centerpiece is a Minoan athelet jumping over a raging bull , really fascinating ! Well worth a visit !",
          "The Minoan collection of artifacts is stunning and huge. A must see in Heraklion. Highlights: the miniature of Knossos Palace, the disk, the original frescoes . . . how many octopi can you count?",
          "We enjoyed this museum very much and learned so much about the Minoans. There are excellent signs in English. It\u2019s not huge to overwhelm either, just the right size. We went to the Knossos palace afterwards and wish we\u2019d skipped that and just visited the museum instead. The",
          "After taking a tour through the ruins, the tourist guide recommend to visit the museum. The museum have a lot of great argueologies exposition. Is a great place to complement your visit at the ruins. With the same ticked, you visit both places",
          "Visited on a Tui tour with a local guide who will pick out the highlights. Lots to see but a couple of hours will suffice unless you're really into archaeology. A lot of unusual artefacts such as jewellery, everyday ancient objects and coffin/bath tubs (you'll find out!!).",
          "Give yourself at least an hour to explore the collections in this museum, which originate from Knossos and other Minoan settlements. If you\u2019ve already visited Knossos, the wooden model depicting how the palace would have looked like during its heyday will be of particular",
          "We have already been to Knossos before but didn't get the chance to visit the museum. This time around we paid one euro extra at knossos for admission to the museum, and it was one will spent. We spent the whole day there and didn't leave until late. The museum is very well",
          "There are some intresting pices on display here but there are alos LOTS of diffrent types of jugs and storage containerd so it become a bit dull after a while. And the staff is always on edge , sure it is understandabel but it still makes you feel uncomfortable to have the",
          "A good way to learn more about the time before the Greeks and Romans. Because I didn\u2019t know much about this it was surely interesting. Also nice arranged everything and clear presentation. A bit too much emphasis on the 15th - 13th century BC though.",
          "After visiting the palace we stop and used our ticket again for the museum. I am personally not into museums, but I enjoyed the model of the palace and the mystery coin display.",
          "If you are on Crete this is must see. My family visited Minoan Night Experience, then Knossos palace and after Heraklion Archaeological Museum. It is all connected. And those old artifacts adds to the mosaic of deep cultural understanding of ancient civilization. Minoans were",
          "It\u2019s a relatively compact museum stuffed with archaeological treasures, mainly from Minoan time. Incredible collection. You can zoom through fast or take your time. There are lots of large groups coming through which could slow down The museum book store has a pour collection",
          "Excellent museum! It provides great historical lessons and context for the items on display and lays them out in such a way that you can walk through history and see the progression of technology from the early Bronze Age up to the early Iron Age. Interesting historical",
          "We went here directly after seeing the palace of Knossos. IT was amazing to see all of the original finds from there. So well presented and very informative also. Very nice extension to the guide tour from Knossos.",
          "Wow, what a great museum, really didn't expect to enjoy it as much, but I did! Fantastic display, well labelled and organised and certainly very well staffed. The only thing is that the staff seemed a bit over the top in terms of their extremely strict attitude if anyone even",
          "If you choose to visit Knossos, it is definitively worth combining the visit to the ruins with this museum, which actually displays the original works of arts, including frescoes, which were collected from Knossos archaeological site. It is just amazing to see what works of art",
          "The exhibits are excellent and laid out well (in date order so you can see the development over time), but the descriptions on the walls alongside (only in Greek or English) have lost some of the letters/words and are quite hard to read, even for a native English speaker - no",
          "Go and visit! Don't think about it. This will tell you so much about the civilizations in Crete and their lives.",
          "Really interesting museum. Really worth a visit. Due to government cuts and a lack of staff we were not allowed to view the mosaics which was really disappointing.",
          "Good artifacts. Small museum. Well organized. Actually preferred to the museum in Athens. Try and visit the archeological sites in the cool if the day. It's quite a trek and then come relax in the cool of museum.",
          "I was very impressed by the way the museum is organised. All labelled in Greek and English. The frescos and sculptures are well displayed. However, I got a bit overdosed on the pottery.",
          "This museum is fantastic. It's home to the most incredible collection of Minoan art and artifacts and is absolutely worth visiting. Highly recommended!!",
          "The museum has 10 of thousands of archeological artefacts. There was no audio guide and it was this difficult to enjoy or assimilate this historic treasure trove - great shame. The curators in attendance were not very helpful - additional statues with no purpose\ud83e\udd13The phaitos",
          "Big history and monuments. Love to have that experience in crete ,athens and santorini . Greece has so many interesting historical museums to enjoy . Do it",

          "Best to combine with a visit to Knossos as this gives you all the context that simply visiting the site may not give you. Great collection which clearly lays out life in Minoan Crete. However, you may be \u2018potted out\u2019 by the end.",

But sadly the reviewer was spot on - room after room of pottery and pots. And quite a lot of",

          "This museum has an abundance of treasure to see. Loads of well preserved goodies to admirer. The kids (4 and 8) really enjoyed it but the museum staff didn\u2019t really like their enthusiasm. We were told to be quiet a couple of times, which was annoying as everyone else was",
          "Would highly recommend visiting Heraklion Archaeological Museum before visiting Knossos. You will see not only many artifacts from Knossos but also a miniature reconstruction that will give you an idea of exactly how Knossos looked originally. Either take a good, detailed",
          "I loved this museum and would suggest that you go there before you visit Knossos and would suggest that if its an either or decision, go for the museum. So much to see and what really came home to me was the creativity of the Minoans.",
          "Visited here and went just after opening time before the tours start for a calm visit round the museum. It\u2019s on 2 levels, with a lift if required, and fascinating looking at all the exhibits, some of which date back to about 4,000 years ago. It takes you through different",
          "Most of the exhibits are Minoan. I got a much clearer picture of how advanced and impressive the Minoans were from the museum visit than I did from the Knossos site itself. The highlights were a bull with intact golden horns and a statuette of the snake goddess that was revered",
          "This museum holds many amazing finds of the Minoan culture that was in many aspects the start of all of western civilisation. Of course there are also more recent artifacts. It's very straightforward to navigate. Some parts of the museum were closed off due to reconstruction,",

          "This museum is a must if you visit Crete, is a great complement to your visit Knossos!. I gave a really bad review to our visit based on our experience with the personnel working at the museum, my family and I had the opportunity to visit multiple museums around the globe and",
          "Unless you are an archaeologist, Minoan site visits can be frustrating and disappointing. A prior visit to this excellent museum will give you a few clues about what you will find at the sites.",
          "A wonderful large museum which we visited after spending the morning at Knossos Archeological Site. This museum is full of amazing exhibits from the site and you need a minimum of two hours to absorb all the history on show.",

So much was dug up out of Crete rulers\u2019 tombs from 5000 BC, and it\u2019s on display here, in very good condition with easy to read descriptions. The sophistication of Crete\u2019s culture at the time of Egypt",
          "This museum is so interesting. There are so many things to see and learn. The exhibitions and rooms are spectacular, the building itself is beautiful, and there is an area outside where you can eat or just sit and relax with a view of the city. Love this place.",
          "Europe\u2019s ancient history presented simply and beautifully. You do not need a guide to enjoy this lovely place. The gift shop is minimal",

          "We visited Crete for the first time this year and had high hopes of this museum; it had been hyped to the skies. As I'd recently finished a museum skills course, I was also very interested to see how things were done in a country other than my own. And there were some beautiful",
          "Wonderful collection of Greek artifacts and plenty of information available, this museum is perfect for anyone who is interested in Greek history. However be advised, in conjunction with much of Crete, toilet paper is to thrown in a bin rather than down a toilet. This is fine,",
          "Do not miss visiting this museum. Wonderful artifacts and frescoes found at the Knossos Palace site. We had a private guide while touring the museum which enhanced our visit. A must see.",
          "Great display of Minoan artefacts, Roman/Greek statues & Frescoes. Part of the Greek/ Roman section was closed off. Spent over 2 hours there. You can buy a combined ticket, which allows you into Knossos Palace too. Warning though to those over 65, you must have 'proof of age' to",

          "The best museum to see Minoan civilization in Greece located in Heraklion Town centre. The complete collection of Cretan artefacts from Minoan era. A must visit & important attraction in Crete !",
          "Lots of archeological things, really versatile collection, a travel through time. I suggest to visit the museum first, then Knossos palace, so you can imagine better how the palace looked like. Here it's well explained and illustrated. I only rated 4 not 5 because less would be",
          "We ended up here before we went to Knossos but it honestly didn't matter. The age of the artifacts here is astounding and really makes you reconsider how you think about history.",
          "Had a fantastic tour of the Knossos Palace with We Guide, Joanna, and then got to see the many artifacts she mentioned on the tour.",
          "Very interesting walk around the museum you can easily do this yourself without a guide if you\u2019re prepared to take public transport from the suburbs. Amazing a lot of these items have survived such a long time! Only sight drawback it was heavy on the items such as pots and",
          "We spent two and a half hours at this museum. One of the best of its kind. Beautifully displayed with artifacts from different ancient sites.",
          "It's nice it's weird to get too and drive its easier... Toilets are on site, clean and well maintained",
          "Make sure you go here after visiting the Palace of Knossos, it all makes sense and shows off a fantastic collection of wonderful findings, there is a joint ticket available currently 16 Euros for both attractions, which represents a saving of 4 Euros as otherwise its 10 Euros",
          "This is a beautifully curated collection. Even with crowds it is enjoyable to visit. Getting in is efficient, but once in facilities such as bathrooms need an upgrade. At the time of our visit there was no cafe! Unbelievable for a museum of this importance. What a missed",
          "This museum is excellent. It has an excellent selection of artifacts from the region and is well curated. I often get impatient in museums, but I wish I could have spent more time here. It was impressive! I purchased the ticket that also got me into the palace at Knossos, which",
          "Went to this museum following a tour of Knossos on 5 June.. The museum is on 2 floors but after touring the ground floor exhibits when we went upstairs the only part open was the fresco display the rest of the floor was closed. This meant nearly half the museum was closed. When",
          "A detailed and interesting collection of historic Greek artefacts. Lots of information. Some amazing pieces that demonstrate the incredible craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks. A large amount of artefacts from Knossos are here and we preferred the museum to visiting the site",
          "This is a modern museum with a treasure trove of artefacts. Well presented, easy to move around and very well lit.",
          "My wife and I were truly in awe of what is on show at this amazing museum. Every item is unique and not one is duplicated. From beautiful Minoan relics 3000BC which make you wonder how they could produce such items given this was the Bronze Age! The layout is excellent and moves",
          "Not Le Louvre or the British national museum or any other great famous museum but a very large illustration and explanation of the mineo\u00e0n civilization !Amazing !",
          "Personally I would say this was the best museum I have ever been to. Truly I am amazed.The ancient Minoan artefacts are as stunning as anything you'd see in a museum of 20th century art. Even if you're not particularly interested in history or archaeology, I'd suggest",
          "We spent an entire day at the museum taking a deep dive into the amazing array of wonderful archaeological findings. The only complaint was the cafeteria was not open so we had to leave the museum to go to lunch. When we returned they told us there was no re-entry even though we",
          "Although not massive it has some amazing things, fantastic insight into the history of Crete. Some of the articles are beautiful and the craftsmanship from the period beggars belief. Worth a visit . Entrance is \u20ac10 for an adult the staff were very friendly and helpful too.",
          "This museum is considered one of the best archeological museums one must not miss the opportunity to visit whenbin Heraklion Crete.It focuses on mimoan civilazation and displays magnificent articrafts of that period.The mozaics are spectacular they are so vivid and fascinating",
          "It took us about 3 hours to get through the museum, and it wowed us all the way through, from the earliest civilizations through the entire history of ancient Greece. Every time I thought I had seen the coolest piece ever, there was another piece on display that was even",
          "For anyone interested in our past history the Minoan culture is mind blowing. The exhibition is first class and for a non historian very humbling. If you are Heraklion then don\u2019t miss this. I saw with a tour group but hung around until everyone left, I could then the the",
          "An excellent museum! So many things to see. The Greek civilization exposed in a perfect way. Don\u2019t leave without visiting the upper floor with the frescos.",
          "A very nice museum who somebody can see details for Minoan civilization through different eras, from 3500 BC to 1100 BC. It's located in city centre, at old town. Average time of visit lasts from two to three hours and price ticket is 10 euros for adults. Definitely a good value",
          "We actually visited this collection twice during our stay as we are particularly interested in ceramics and the collection is stunning. However I couldn\u2019t bring myself to give five stars as I\u2019m in agreement with the people who have mentioned the staff, who in my opinion were",
          "I have been to alot of museums in alot of different countries and this was a whole new experience. The artifacts and material are very interesting however we did not spend as long as I would have liked as I felt all the staff were staring. Anytime you go near anything to look at",
          "The Museum is well laid out and has a blizzard of interesting artifacts. Incredibly they are mostly BC and if you go here first, then Knossos as a secondary visit might be mads a more interesting to your imagination. Surely, you have to add this Museum to your list if you have",
          "I think that the museum itself is very nice, but the organisation of tour guides are entirely below the standards. I was so unlucky that I meet inside the museum four guides. Two of them were ok - Polish and English - they were using microphones and headphones - usual standard",
          "The museum is stunning and full of amazing Artefacts. It's incredible to think that most of the items on display are thousands of years old. It takes you back in time and allows you to marvel at how such intricate items were made with basic tooling and materials. One thing that",
          "Toured the museum with a guide, which was excellent. However, we had to zip around a great deal of the rooms, which took about an hour. Not enough time, but if you leave, your ticket does not allow you to re enter! So many wonderful items!",
          "After visiting the palaces at Knossos, Malia and others, come here to this beautiful new museum and see the fabulous art and artifacts from the Minoan archaological sites. The upstairs also has some Greek and Roman works but they were closed as was the small cafe when we were",
          "So interesting! You need time to see all these fantastic things! So you need to arrange to have enough time to spend.",
          "We visited here on a guided tour after we had been to the Knossos Temple earlier in the day. It has some amazing artefacts from the Minoan and early roman civilisations. Our tour guide said it had only just reopened after three years of renovation. It is good to combine both",
          "An almost unbelievable collection of artefacts from pre-Minoan to Romano-Greek sites on the island. The Minoan era collection is mostly of grave goods and, because these personal possessions and offerings were carefully buried, they are in outstanding condition. The decoration",
          "An extremely interesting visit to this museum. Part of the museum was closed along with the restaurant. Very well laid out interior with well presented artefacts dating back to 7000 BC right up to 0 AD.",
          "We had been looking forward to visiting the museum (and then visiting Knossos) for years, and the place is beautifully laid out and perfectly lit. So much to see! But...about a third of the museum was closed off (one guard said that they didn\u2019t have the staff to keep it open)",
          "A very well laid out myseum with fabulous, mind-bogglingly beautiful artefacts from all the sites in Crete. Should not be missed. Strategically placed benches. Lifts to the upper floor. Do not miss the film at the end explaining the history of the museum itself.",
          "Well organised and presented. Very pleasant and specious venue with a superb Collection. Helpful staff that were keen to answer questions.",
          "This is a well laid out the museum that depicts the ancient history of Knossos. I would probably recommend visiting this museum for about an hour before visiting Knossos itself. It provides a good background that allows one to better associate the ruined at Knossos.",
          "A stunning collection of artefacts which were displayed well with very indepth explanations along the way. The best part however is the layout, which you follow room by room until you reach the exit. Spent 2 hours there and loved it. Only improvement would be either A/C or",
          "Chose to go here as it was too hot to walk around Knossos, after speaking with people I think we got more information here than at Knossos ruins. The artefacts themselves, quality of displays etc. were very good. I would have liked shorter information labels on individual",
          "The quality of some of the pieces is amazing given the period they come from. We had an excellent guide who gave us much contextual history. Really great space, good displays.",
          "The museum displays artifacts from the Island's history dating back thousands of years. from the stone age onwards. It has an excellent collection of artifacts from the Minoan civilization which flourished on the island and is considered the best in the World for Minoan Art.",
          "This is a must see if one is at all interested in the origins of Western Civilization. Extensive collection of artifacts from Minoan and earlier civilizations. Many of the artifacts are from the nearby Knossos Palace archeological site, but also include artifacts from other",
          "Interesting, but more information about every object would be necessary, or a guided Tour. A little bit boring for children as there are no interactive activities.",
          "Best visited after a trip to the Kinossos Palace ruins, and easily accessible by the same #2 bus on your return journey. Remember to buy a joint entry ticket at Kinossos Nicely laid out and explained. Wealth of artefacts from 2000BC onwards. Amazing condition and artistry/",
          "This museum is amazing, nothing like the usual dusty array of boring artefacts. Some of the exhibits are incredible, hard to believe they date from 1600-3000 bc. The jewellery on display is fantastic.",
          "So many artefacts on show, I spent hours here. An absolute steal for the price of entry. I bought the ticket to this combined with access to the Palace of Knossos. Mindblowing displays, with everything very well explained in concise English.",
          "2 floors. Simple layout. Glad we had a tour guide with us to lead us through or I might not have appreciated it as much. Beautiful murals and pottery.",
          "I spent hours and hours in this wonderful museum. What a tremendous collection of artifacts from the ancient Greek civilization! This is a MUST SEE when in Crete.",
          "The museum houses many artefacts displayed in a chronological manner. The staff advise as to the best route and although notices say no photography is allowed no one prevented photographs being taken although no flash was used. The fresco displays on the second floor are",
          "The museum is a very good place to get a great overview from the Minoan time and history. Take your time, for sure you will need 2 hours or more.",
          "double up and see the place of knossos for 16 euros a great way to spend an afternoon . went on a Sunday and the cafe was closed which was dissapopinting. but the exhibits are excellent and lots of places to sit , when you get to our age and having spent 3 hours walking around",
          "Well worth a visit , very interesting to learn about the past of such a fascinating place we all enjoyed it",
          "The ticket is sold along with Knossos palace by paying just 1 euro extra. It is recommended to visit the place after seeing the palace. The museum is on 2 floors. The ground has all artifacts recovered from Knossos. The bee pendant is the highlight. Scripts, statues, vessels,",
          "We enjoyed the Archaeological Museum very much, it is even free for students in the EU! There was a lot of information on all the artefacts which were well maintained. There was a lot of history that I recognised from visiting Knossos Palace and there is certainly a lot to learn",
          "see Crete from years gone by.you need a good few hours to see all the amazing artifacts on show here,great day out",
          "If you intended to visite Knossos then YOU-must visit the museum first or you won\u2019t understand all the guide will tell you, it is important to take your time and read all the information provided, the museum would clearly benefit from some audio guide or a tablet application to",
          "We were informed that the museum does not provide guided tours. This however was no drawback because of the description on the object lables was also in English.",
          "We visit here prior to going to Knossos & what a good idea that was. The exhibits are well laid out & the information is good. If you are over 65 & take photo I.d. you can get a combined ticket for this, & Knossos, at half price.",
          "Very attractive in layout and presentation of a huge array of artifacts from Neolithic times forward to Roman era. Great insights into skills and wealth of the Minoan and Cretan cultures and Empires. Especially the development of pottery, jewelry and working with rocks.",
          "Great museum with lots of English explanations, tons of material and very much a professional museum! Well worth the money, and we learned a lot!",
          "It was interesting, yet the information could be more elaborate. We missed the interaction and would have liked more different items and explanations",
          "We purchased the combination ticket for Knossos and the museum and enjoyed both. There were lots of helpful signs along with displays. Some of the frescoes were more modern completion than original, but still beautiful. Sometimes can get clogged up with big groups, but well",
          "Both the collection of this museum and its presentation are breathtaking. A definite must-see. Go there before you visit Knossos.",
          "Okay, so I know a bit about history and archaeology and a lot of the exhibits had meaning for me but the overall effect of this 'modern' museum was simply a let-down. For the average customer I can see much of the display falling into the boring category. Little attention has",
          "Great to do after the palace of Knossos so very interesting stuff here over 6000 years old not to be missed",
          "Well-presented items from the archaeological sites in Crete and the surrounding islands. Explanations in English. A manageable museum that enhances your understanding of the Minoan and later civilizations. If you visit the ruins, you need to visit the museum.",
          "Interesting Museum with lots of beautiful vessels and gold jewellery even the modern women would be proud to wear. The history behind each display was fascinating. Really enjoyed our visit here.",
          "If you like ancient Greece it is a must see for you. Rich descriptions, well organized displays and hundreds of excellent artifacts showing what was lost. It is really amazing collection. What I missed most was more modern times. Have at least 2 hrs to see all rooms.",
          "Museum is laid out well, without crowding, so we were able to browse around others fairly easily. The combined ticket with knossos makes thia good value. We parked at the port for \u00a32.50 for the day.",
          "Beautiful museum dedicated to the extraordinary finds taken by the 20th century finds of Evans at Knossos. Priceless pieces of mosaic, ceramics and Gold jewelry. Plan at least an hour to work your way through thevexhabits",
          "This museum is a gem. Very different content to the new archeological museum in Athens. We particularly loved the frescoes from around 2000 B.C., many of which were from the Minoan Knossos palace (about 6km away), but there is much, much more. Artefacts are beautifully",
          "Since the construction of a brand new archaeological museum in Heraklion (I think it opened it 2012) the stunning finds from all over Crete are now properly displayed for the very first time. A joint ticket (valid for three days) is available for both entrance to the",
          "It was worth the visit. The communities in that era was very advanced. It came as a surprise. I was very impressed with some of the pottery design and functionality. I can see where a lot of gold jewellery design cane from ( even the ones from a India and China). There was a",
          "Once you have visited Knossos, the palace at Phaistos or the palace at Malia head back to this museum and spend a wonderful afternoon absorbed in history. At Knossos you can buy a joint ticket so entry to the museum will only be 1 euro rather than 5 euros - not sure whether",
          "This is a very good museum with exhibits from many different periods showing extensive history of Crete",
          "For an intro to Minoan culture, visitors should plan for a few hours at least at this modern museum. Lots of fascinating artifacts with descriptions in Greek and in English.",
          "went there with a package tour and tour guide. it was very interesting and leant a lot about history of Crete and minoan kingdom. definitely worth a visit if you are interest in the culture and history of Crete.",
          "This museum provides a very important complement to a visit to the ruins of the Temple of Knossos. As much as the Knossos site is very poorly presented, this museum makes up for it with beautifully presented and described artefacts dating back to the beginnings of the Minoan",
          "The exhibits are superb and the museum itself is a joy. Everything is displayed beautifully. What a great collection they have. The treasures of Knossos are in the museum.",
          "Nicely organized and a great pair to see before knossos. Lots of great minoan artifacts showing the evolution of their culture.",
          "The museum we well designed and there were good informatics. The title sounds a bit glib but we were genuinely blown away by the exhibits especially those from over 5000 years ago. Some of the jewellery and ceramics could match those produced today. The cafe was closed so go for",
          "Absolutely amazing exhibits from the minion civilization..... cap this off with a trip to the larger archeological museum in Athens !",
          "23 years since my last visit to the museum and (being older and possibly wiser) my decision to re-visit was a good one. The museum is amazing and the number of exhibits, both large and small, overwhelming and breathtaking, allowing you to appreciate the unbelievable artistry and",
          "Great place for history, but go here as well as Knossos Palace so you can see where they got a lot of the exhibits from.",
          "I visited after I saw the attraction (Knossos, downtown, port) and I learned so much more about the history. I highly recommend a visit.",
          "Amazed about the history of crete !!! Very friendly staff i definetely recomend it . Its a must going there .",
          "If you are interested in history, and planning on visiting any ruins on Crete, you must stop first at this fantastic museum. The displays are informative, and very well laid out. Phenomenal objects on display! It could definitely be improved for children and those interested in",
          "Don't miss this-worth the trip to Crete. Do not let your tour group short-change the time you need to visit this museum.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It's well thought out, and the content is really interesting. The miniature reconstructions of Knossos was helpful and beautiful. Good collections and good organization.",
          "So much rich ancient history for the region I had no idea! Great educational experience for the whole family. Also great companion to the Knossos site.",
          "We ran round and had a great time here. Really fascinating exhibits with some great pieces from the palace at Knossos - best done after the palace so that the pieces add up.",
          "Allow plenty of time to read, gaze, wander and reflect on the magnificent collection of Cretan artefacts, many from Knossos, assembled in this one place, from long ago! One has to marvel at the ingenuity, creativity, sophistication, hard work, training, loveliness and beauty of",
          "A great collection of objects from Minoan sites, sorted chronologically and supported by informative boards and interactive screens. Most exhibited items are ceramics but the styles and uses are so varied that it would be hard to get bored. You can also learn about the Minoan",
          "A nice museum, but have a guide! My second time here, and there is hard to understand stories and stuff just by looking!",
          "The numerous findings from the Palace of Knossos such as art, pottery, vessels, figurines, and the original wall-paintings, are all housed in Archaeological Museum of Heraklion. This museum contains the most important Minoan collection.",
          "Minimum 2 hours to enjoy it. Best sight in town. Indoor, fully air conditioning during summer. I was thrilled by the golden ring of King Minos. Ideal to be combined with shopping. There is combined ticket with Knossos Palace which is 5km south of the town. There is cheap blue",
          "An excellent presentation of artifacts of vases, statues, jewellery that have been dated 2000 and 3000 BC. Makes you realise there was a well ordered civilisation that the Greeks of today feel in their DNA. I felt that this was much more enlightening than Knossos. Of course",
          "Just of off the large central square is the museum which costs 16 per adult for a three day ticket including Knossos The museum is firstly well laid out in date order and colour coded so easy to walk through However what is more interesting is the collection which has many",
          "Truly unique pieces to Crete. Quite a bit of history here so ensure you have at least an hour or two to visit. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum is quite small but very interesting and well presented ! I much more appreciated that place to the Cnossos Palace and I really felt here the importance of the civilization presented there. Definiticely the place to see in Heraklion !",
          "It is definitely essential, not only for the fans of history tourism to pay a visit to this museum, since it its expedition includes the most significant parts of Greek history and especially the Minoan culture 2500 years BC.One disadvantage is that auto guide is not available.",
          "If you want to see the miracles a great ancient civilization can create you must visit the Historical museum of Crete. A unique experience that you will remember for the rest of your life.",
          "Please go there to watch and admire a great ancient civilization, the Minoan one. Wonderful pieces of art magnificently displayed. You will not regret your visit.",
          "The museum was straightforward and easy to understand. It was also winter time during our visit, so the tickets were half-priced. We walked through the museum without a guide, and it was manageable. The rooms are labeled and a suggested route is plotted out, so you just have",
          "This is a wonderful museum showcasing the finds from the Minoan Civilisation in Crete. Dating from early times onwards the main focus is 2000 - 1200 BCE. There are statues, pottery, flints and much more. The colourful wall paintings are stunning. You can spend 1,2, 3 or even 4",
          "We greatly enjoyed this superb museum. Having visited three Minoan sites it was so rewarding to see so many treasured artefacts clearly displayed. There was an excellent introduction to each section and good descriptions in English by the artefacts. The Minoan civilisation was",
          "This is an incredible collection of artefacts and a must see if visiting the area. Not expensive and easy place to find. Close to the centre of town so easy walking distance.",
          "We visited the Heraklion Archeological Museum last September. Place is awsome! Very nice and organised!",
          "Great overview of the major historical artefacts around Crete and giving the back story on the island and its history. While this attraction is by no means cheap, if you enjoy museums you will find this attraction a must see. I would say the quality of the exhibits are on par",
          "Such a great museum. I really appreciated the phaestus disc. So cool and interesting to read about. The museum takes a long time so come prepared. We did it at night and loved it. Not many people and cooler temps. Highly recommended. Our favorite thing besides going to Knossos.",
          "The museum is perfect: modern, full of information, clean, well illuminated. Today it was half price so I even got a great bargain at five euros. I strongly suggest it to anyone, more than Knossos. I stayed inside two hours...",
          "Very well presented, with good explanations. Not too many people and the area of this city is worth being visited as well A few parkings outside",
          "Good Museum, lots to see and well displayed, visited just on a day visits as part of a cruise party. Would've been good to have more time to look at the artefacts in more depth.",
          "Everything you ever wanted to know about the Minoan civilisation. Unbeatable. Later Greek and Roman period, also good. Down side is that it can be a bit hard for kids, as it is not interactive.",
          "If you go to only one museum on Crete, make it this one, and plan to spend at least 3 hours, or better, go 2 days in a row. Great collection, well displayed. Only downside is that they close at 3, as do other museums in Heraklion.",
          "This Museum was wonderful. However, if you buy the \u20183 day combo ticket with Knossos Palace\u2019 you can only visit each place once. When we went to the Museum the entire 1st floor was closed. We were told that we couldn\u2019t come back the next day. Eventually, the ticket seller did",
          "Exceptional and exciting place! The beginnings of European civilization, but also of the visible influences of other civilizations of the Middle East! Each exhibit leaves a deep impression. Artistic expression, craftsmanship, beauty of these objects fascinates you. It was worth",
          "A museum well worth visiting. The range and quality of the artefacts is truly stunning. Recommend giving yourselves plenty of time or even making two visits to take it all in!",
          "After extensive renovation, the museum finally has the facilities needed to house such a wide and important array of exhibits hailing mainly from the Minoan civilization. Only thing I would like to comment is that I didn't find an easily accessible map of the ancient cities",
          "Great exhibits of some of the most famous and significant historical arifacts of ancient civilizations. I am glad I can now say I saw these with my own eyes before I die.",
          "I travel a lot and have been to many museums and honestly it is one of the best perhaps the best. Why? the layout of the museum allow for easy follow of history. The artefacts are fantastic. I was amazed at how the Minoan people were such great artisans. Definitely worth the",
          "Heraklion (or more accurately, Heracleon) has an excellent museum, unlike anything you can find on the planet. It houses the best exchibition of Minoan art. The Minoans, at their peak, generated culture that still feels contemporary, and influenced abstract art (Picasso and the",
          "We had just 2 hours. Not enough time! There is so much to see, so much to wonder at, such beauty & ingenuity, so well displayed. We only had time to dip in here & there, and left feeling quite frustrated at how much we missed, as we know we'll never be back. PS be careful not",
          "One of the oldest, largest and most important museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. The Herakleion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.",
          "This is worth a visit to see the famous frescoes from the palace at Knossos. It is not the best type of museum for kids as not very interactive at all. So if you travel with kids...concentrate on the main things and try to help them engage with the artefacts.",
          "This is fairly new and worth seeing. We were on a cruise and only had a half day in crete so we bought a combo ticket for this s=and knossos palace great value!",
          "Must see it ! Perfect archeological museum and it was good occasion with free entrance on Saturday afternoon",
          "You need to go there. It's a cultural journey that you must be in. It's actually accessible cause it's close to the most know square : the lion square.",
          "An excellent museum, really well curated - taking you through the Minoan, Greek and Roman periods. Definitely recommend visiting here before going to any of the actual archaeological sites around Crete.",
          "Visited this lovely museum before Knosses. Feel it was right way to do it. Bought joint tickets for both venues. Learnt a lot in well laid out museum. Not busy this time of year. Could have stayed longer than the 2 hours we stayed there but, it closes earlier in winter. 4pm.",
          "You can easily spend up to a couple of hours here, very informative and well laid out. Be careful of the times in winter, as it closes at 4pm.",
          "Very informative place, great works of art and archeological foundings. Here You can learn about Cretan (and greek) history, You can almost feel and touch it. Many beautiful subjects from minoan age, i love the FAISTOS, the bull's head and the original pieces of Knossos frescs.",
          "On a short one day visit to Heraklion we visited both the Palace of Knossos and the Archaeological Museum. Doing both complemented each other well. We took a private tour at the Palace but did a self-tour in the museum. The museum was top-notch in its presentation and have",
          "You just cannot go to Crete and fail to visit the Heraklion museum! You will get amazed by the findings, the detailed decorations, the drawings, the coins, and jewelry. I keep wondering what a great civilization that was! No wonder why Minoans had no enemies and their",
          "We had a short visit unfortunately, but the collection, pieces as well as the organisation, but the staff is awfully rude, which quite spoil the visit... I advise to have at least 2hours ahead.",
          "It is a must! We only had a half day, and I could have easily spent an entire day in there and wish I were closer so I could go back. The restaurant was not open, so I can't comment on it, but there are a lot of places to eat in the vicinity.",
          "We went to the museum on the first Sunday of the month (Free admission). Even with the large crowds the staff kept everything flowing smoothly. Pictures are allowed (no flash). They have a lot of items from pre historic (11 century BC and earlier) times and a wonderful display",
          "Well worth a visit shows so much of the history of Crete makes it easier to understand even if you are not a history fan.",
          "Not at all impressive externally but surprisingly good museum inside! What you are left with is the story of the inevitable rise and fall of the Minoan civilization, from the start in the Bronze Age, through Iron Age, it\u2019s peak and decline.. except it lasted over 1,500 years!",
          "2 floors of stuff, the main things of interest are the Minoan-era items prior to the Hellenic era. Very interesting 'Kamares ware' pottery style I've never seen before. Also the fresco styles are unique, somewhat Egyptian-influenced. I didnt know bull-jumping was a sport!",
          "We spent the day at this amazing museum. There are so so many wonderful exhibits to see here you really need time to take everything in. I thought the bathtub exhibit was the most amazing. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful to be able to see all of the things that are in this museum. It",
          "Excellent museum, showing artefacts from Knossos and other Minoan sites. Exhibits set out in a very organized way with plenty of light and space. It certainly enhanced our visit to Knossos.",
          "This is an absolute must-visit location when in Crete. So glad we took time to see it after our visit to Knossos, it gave a much much better perspective of the Minoan civilization. Very impressive collection of artefacts, all real and authentic (not reconstructed as in Knossos),",
          "We were on a short holiday in Crete and decided that we would like to take a day trip to Heraklion and the Palace of Knossos, We found a tour by Sparrow Travel, which suited us as it picked us up and dropped us off near to our hotel. We paid a combined ticket for the",
          "Really enjoyed our visit after seeing Knossos, brought home the importance of the dig with some really interesting art & jewellery. All displays in French, English, German, Greek & Russian. No queuing lots of Information.",
          "First visit to this Museum. We went on an organised tour from Rethymno with Klados. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and my niece listened intently and found the whole experience wonderful.",
          "The exterior of the building can in no way prepare you for the amazing inside of this spacious museum, which in my opinion is easily one of the top 3 Greek museums. It will take some time to explore but it's the ABSOLUTE MUST when you visit Heraklion!",
          "A must when in Heraklion. The exhibits of one of the most ancient civilisations in the world are spectacular. Don't miss the Phestos discus. Great renovation work.",
          "Easy going museum in the center of Heraklion. Well laid out and interesting without being boring. Highly recommend.",
          "This is a mst if you like history. Very well displayd, although they could work a liitle with the lights. Generous photo policy. Good explanations. Not to be missed if you are interested in history.",
          "After visited Knosos that lacks good and scientific explanations, we also visited Archeological museum, which was great and to me it seemed like everything makes much more sense. There are two floors + usually one extra, smaller exhibition. Btw: there are some dates when they",
          "If you like artifacts and history this place is for you. Very interesting to see how the civilization developed on Crete. I didn\u2019t have time to go to the actual site, but felt like this gave me a good feel for the development of the early civilizations and their beliefs. Highly",
          "One of the best archaeological museums although it doesn't have the size of the British Museum or Louvre. Every object shown is absolutely unique and notable for understanding of the importance of Crete civilization at the time of Minoans.",
          "Spent the day touring the palace of Knossos and also this museum. They really go hand in hand as most of the artifacts here come from Knossos. I would actually stop here first if you have a choice and if you can get a good tour guide it is a major plus. Mostly pottery and",
          "I went on a Sunday after going to the Palace of Knossos. I ended up being free entry. The courtyard was beautiful: columns, shaded with trees and lots of places to sit. A great place to sit and chill out before or after a visit to the museum. You do have to go through a little",
          "Excellent museum, showing artefacts from Knossos and other Minoan sites. Allow two hours or more if you want to rest between exhibits. See this before going to Knossos. There is a combined ticket for both, and if you are over 65, hold and bring an EU passport with you, it's",
          "We went all they way from Sissi to see this museum but unfortunately it was closed as the staff were on strike!",
          "Nicely laid out and presented -top quality museum - well worth a visit! It\u2019s a good 1-2 hour visit. Highly recommended",
          "After visiting Knossos I wanted to see some of the frescos and other original remains The place is very well organized and is full of interesting excavations It has English explanations and you can take pictures of most items There was no guide or audio guide options which",
          "We visited with are 6 month old and used a stroller inside. The Museum has lots to look at and the combo ticket with the archeological site does not cost much more. We first went to the museum and then the site but I would do it the other way around on the next visit.",
          "Do not miss this museum if you go to Heraklion!! Everything is well-thought-out and you move through the museum in chronological order, which helps you to build on what you learn and do so progressively. Took 2 hours to go through all the rooms (2 floors); I took lots of pics.",
          "An incredible wealth of artifacts and information about the past. One could spend much more than 2-3 hours here, but I found that 3 hours was the maximum amount of time before I was so exhausted that i couldn't take in any more (and I did not read every sign or look closely at",
          "Everything Minoan you can think of. Spent about three hours here. Well organized and presented artifacts.",

          "His museum is a must see attraction. Even if you are a clueless fool who loves only celebrity culture you should come here just to see how little we have developed in 5000 years. The museum is stuffed full of magnificent artefacts from the Minoan culture, many of which were",

          "We had a great time exploring the elaborate collection of the museum, they have a lot of beautifull pieces that help you visualise the life in the old civilisations. If you plan on visiting the Knossos palace site within 3 days it\u2019s worth buying the combo ticket, saves you a lot",

          "We did things the opposite of the tours. we saw the museum first and then Knossos. We like this better because we feel we can place the items in the museum better when we go the site. This worked out well in this case as their is a scale model in the museum. It is very well laid",

          "If you have been to some of the archeological sites on the island, this gives you a great insight of the arts and crafts. Some of the pots and figurines are so beautiful, it is hard to imagine they have survived for such a long time. Enjoyed it very much!",
          "Incredible iconic artifacts of ancient crete. Amazing stuff. Recommend a tour with Ionna Glyptis to get full and correct context; the wall plaques are useful, but not always complete or accurate.",

          "I'm very glad I visited the museum (which was included in my 8 euro OAP ticket for Knossos. Seeing all the Minoan artefacts enhances the whole Knossos experience. The highlight for me was the Minoan draughts game. But all the pottery and jewelry were also remarkable. I didn't",

          "For an extra 1 euro we added a visit to this museum to our ticket price at the Knossos site. After spending about 3 hours wandering around Knossos we made the effort to drive into Heraklion and visit the museum where all of the ACTUAL artifacts, including frescoes that were",

          "We enjoyed very much the marvellous artifacts. Exhibitions are pretty well organized. It would have been an interesting visit, if there hadn't been so many noisy groups, all led by screaming guides. What a pity for such an important museum.",
          "The museum itself is beutiful! We didn\u2019t have a guide! And I strongly recomend that, otherwise all you do is looking on clayfigures, statues, tools and so on, without any background! We ordered combined tickets for 16 Euros, because we Will visit Knossos later! A single ticket",
          "This is a very interesting museum with a lot to see and read about. If you are visiting Knossos or going this is the place to see all the artifacts from there.",

          "Four of us debated wether or not to visit, we were glad we did, with an entry price of only \u20ac2 it was certainly worth it. The 360 degree views from the battlements were dramatic over the city, port and over to Santorini. Inside a number of artefacts including in amazingly good",

          "Stunning location. The castle is in a good location just off the harbour which is a short walk for people visiting by cruise, it is also a short distance from sight seeing bus. There is a very peaceful walk around the harbour too which is very relaxing",

          "From its prominent place in the harbor, it really doesn\u2019t look as extensive as it is. It is well done and curated. Many restorations have made this a real walk through the Venetian history of Heraklion.",
          "It's an interesting Venetian fortress to visit. If you read information on the walls with a history of this fortress, you will like this visit a lot more. Fortress is a very good shape. Tickets are almost free (2EUR for adults). Many points to photo and panorama views. Highly",

          "Our hotel overlooked the fort and we almost didn\u2019t visit it. What a loss that would have been. It is in amazing condition with pictures and history of the town and fort included. If your in town, it\u2019s a must see!",
          "Hey will love this place. Only \u20ac2 entry for adults and it will keep them occupied with lots of nooks and crannies to explore. The history of the castle is told for the adults in boards around the various rooms. The story is fascinating, well worth the admission fee. Also there",
          "Wonderful structure, exhibits, and views. A venue must if you are visiting this lovely Greek city. A 21 year siege against the Ottoman Turks!",
          "Nice Venetian fort well restaured and interesting. Affordable entry price : 2\u20ac (High season) A lot of nice pictures to be taken from the terrasse (Great views)",
          "Well worth a visit to this place that has a rich history. And only a few Euro\u2019s to enter the place. Has a lot of old Greek history inside and a few old Greek pots and cannon balls from days gone by. And you can walk all around the roof top that\u2019s shows you the lovely sites the",

          "As part of the old harbour, the Castello is a dramatic and evocative landmark emphasising Heraklion position as an important, admittedly now in the past tense, Mediterranean port. The fortification is extremely interesting whether you only decide to walk around the exterior",
          "Lots of interpretive panels to explain the history of the fortifications. Great views for taking photos of the city. Cheap parking near the port terminal to the east",
          "Walked passed the castle after dinner, therefor it was only to be viewed from the outside. And then it is just a massive old building. Nothing special done to make it attractive in the evening unfortunately.",
          "We fell in love with this castle. Beautiful views. Better than anything else we\u2019ve seen on Crete. We want to move in lol",
          "Really surprised by this Castello but certainly not disappointed. Well worth the visit with some interesting aspects",
          "The castle at the entrance to Heraklion port is well-preserved, with plenty of historical information provided in its rooms and passages; there are also some archaeological artifacts. Great views from the ramparts.",
          "Lovely little walk each night. I didn't go inside, but did wander down the pier each night after our supper. You can watch the ships come in, the locals fishing, and just get some exercise while you enjoy being on Crete.",
          "Free for teenagers and only 2Euro for each adult. Very reasonable. Open till 8ish so is good option for stroll before dinner. Lovely views and terrace but very windy so hold on to your hats!!",

          "It looked unimpressive from the outside ( except for the cannonballs stuck in the fascade,) but inside had great displays. The price is cheap, 2 Euros, I think. There are ongoing movies. Cannonballs, amphora, stories of the area and its history. The view from the walls, if",
          "you can't help seeing it wherever you are in town-avoid crowded hours-wear comfy shoes and take lots and lots of photos",

          "The Koules Fortress is stunning from the outside and it continues inside. There is an interesting video and information boards in Greek and English telling you everything you need to know about it's interesting history. The view from the top is beautiful and worth the \u20ac2 entry",

          "Sorry, as a place to visit it is not worth attention. If you are in Heraklion, you have no choice. I would say it is good for slow walking, watching a ferry or boat, which are sailing to the port, from the walls of the casle. The most scenic view as usually is during the dark",
          "For just 2euros (or half price if you're from the EU and 65+!) this has to be the best value ever. it's a very attractive spot with lovely views from the top over the harbour. There's much more to see than we had expected and the information boards (happily in English as well as",
          "While interesting, the site itself was not well labeled, such that it was a bit difficult to understand the significance of each of the spaces and/ or objects included in the visit. The view from the top was lovely and invigorating, but again, missing much information or detail",
          "With just 2 euros you can imagine a little the lives of people who lived in 1600 . You can also go to the top of the fortress to have a nice view.",
          "Interesting. Gives some history of the Venetian occupation of Crete. Other than getting a great view of the city, not too much else to see.",
          "Lovely old castle and part of the local history and the defence of the port. Simply striking and worth taking time in this old town to view.",
          "I have visited Koules several times and always loved it. The building is so historic, athmospheric and you can almost travel back in time when you are there. The displays and location are impressive and it is a nice walk by the sea just to get there. I would really recommend it",
          "This visit only cost 2 euros, which is pretty cheap. You can walk through and read all about the castle and its history. There are cannons and other artifacts from the days of wars. There is also a great view from the top of the castle. Overall, a great deal for the price.",
          "THERE can be few more pleasurable places to visit on a searingly hot day than this Venetian fortress whose thick walls ensure a cool walk round inside. I visited this historic site by the harbour during a trip to Heraklion, walking down over the city from the Lions' Fountain and",
          "Wow what a nice piece of history to visit, not only cheap to enter but nicely laid out. You can really feel like you are there when it was first built, and only a short stroll from the centre of town with a large cheap car park nearby at the port.",
          "Great place to visit in Heraklion, 2Euro entrance fee, loads of information inside and lots of history, Theres lovely views from the top of the harbour, There a few benches inside and there are toilets available.",
          "The old castle defended the fort. It is a perfect way to soak in some interesting history and architecture on a hot day. Because of small windows, high ceilings and massively thick stone wall, it is markedly cooler than the outside, which is wonderful on a hot day. You can",
          "This is well worth a visit. We had just checked into our hotel in the late afternoon and went for a walk down to the sea. We decided to visit the fortress as it looked glorious in the sunshine. The entry fee was just 1\u20ac which is amazing. There is a great deal of good information",
          "We visited while waiting to be able to check in to our nearby hotel. This was worth the 2 Euro entrance fee. We learned about the history of the fort and had fun exploring all the areas. There are great views of the harbor!",
          "Standing guarding the harbour this fort is easy to find. It's only 2euro to enter and for that you get good info on the displays inside and some good views from the roof. Easy way to spend an hour",
          "What a great visit this was! The waves beating against the walls of the fort, the golden walls of the fort gently shining in the sun. Very atmospheric. Inside too there's lots to see. The children throughly enjoyed the visit. Only 2 euro entrance and children go free.",
          "For a modest entry fee of only 2 Euro this is a ridiculous bargain! Well preserved castle with plenty of information boards outlining the history of the Venetian background. The harbour views are stunning and BONUS!!! No tour groups!!! It was lovely and cool on a super hot",
          "This recently restored and opened to public is a piece of Venetian pride of Crete\u2019s history. The views are also stunning! \u20ac2 for adults and \u20ac1 for students/discounted is really worth! Make sure to bring home some nice photos!",
          "I arrived at the restored Old Venetian Fortress (Castello del Molo also known as Koules) too late in the afternoon and it had closed for the day. Unfortunately as I was leaving the next day all I could do was take some photos from various locations. Doesn't look that big inside",
          "Especially for the modest entrance fee worth a short stop. On top some nice and ugly views of the harbour. Below cannons and bullets. Nicely rebuilt over the past years.",
          "The Venetian seaside fortress, located at the entrance of the old port, was built in the 16th century and refurbished many times since then due to the violent sea waves or human inflicted damages. It is an interesting place to visit, recently restored, with some great views of",
          "Koules is a beautiful fortress at the corner of the old venecian port of Heraklion city. Now amazingly restored tell to its visitors the stories from the Venetian and Ottoman occupation",
          "Well presented. Worth a visit. Only requires about 30 - 45 minutes. Beautiful inside and out. Has some nice pieces inside but not a huge amount to see and do",
          "The restored fortress is worth a short visit, if only for the views over the harbor. The fortress is a relatively short walk from the Aquila Atlantis Hotel. There also are several good restaurants in the vicinity of the fort.",
          "This fort is at the old Harbour of Heraklion and dates back to the time when Crete was under the control of the city-state of Venice. The fort has recently been renovated and it is well worth a look - especially as an adult ticket is only \u20ac2. There's not a lot to it ( you could",

          "On our previous trip to Crete the Castello has been closed for restoration. This time we were delighted to find it was open to the public. The restoration was very well done and a lot of thought went into the various exhibits. It didn't seem like a museum instead we felt we",
          "Loved the history of this place. When you consider that most of it was constructed in the 15th century and that the walls are 7 metres thick in places it really impressed me. Some of the artifacts from shipwrecks on display are incredible too. I found it much more interesting",
          "A very nice castle with plenty of historical information and a great ambiance (the internal renovation and lighting looks amazing). The inside is interesting and a climb to the roof give a great opportunity to look at the port, the ocean and the city. The location is also great",

          "The Castle/Fortress sits at the entrance to the Old Venetian Harbour in Heraklion. It is a pretty dominant structure. It was built in the 16th century by the Venetians and still remains largely intact. You can visit it for the bargain price of 2 Euros. I really enjoyed the walk",
          "For the bargain price of 2 euros we learned the history of the fort and port and got to have an amazing view of the town too!",
          "A quick visit, but still well worth the 2 \u20ac entrance fee! A magnificent building, a fortress out on the pier in Iraklion harbour, built 500-800 years ago, and the architecture and constructions are stunning, as are the views from the top.",
          "3 euros full price and 1 for seniors. An easy walk around with plentiful well written displays inside. Clean and usable public toilets inside. Good views from the parapets. All in all this is an impressive construction.",

          "A wonderful place at a very good price. Must visit it, Wonderfully well maintained bu the govt. This castle must have been hard to conquer for enemy forces in its era. Pretty well defended it must have been in its time.",
          "I recommend this for visitors, which want to learn about cretan history. For a small fee (2\u20ac) you will get a load of historical facts, plus a very nice view from the terrace over the harbour and bay, and you can cool yourselves in hot days.",
          "This fort was many things, not just used for military purposes but also to shield those who ran here to hide when the Ottomans ruled so harshly. The outside is magnificent but inside it is so much bigger than it looks. There are items from sunken ships, cannons and the views",
          "Considering it's just \u20ac2 to see this wonderful place, you shouldn't miss out. Such a vast history in this fortress of which you'll learn all about while there. They even set out the story about how the fortress was used for people living in Crete trying to evade Ottoman rule,",

          "Located at Heraklion's Old Venetian Harbor, the Koules Fortress and its museum make for a very enjoyable walk and visit. On a clear day, the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. The museum exhibits are so well written (Greek and English) and presented, that I spent hours reading",
          "It will take an hour to see all around in this two-storied sea castle crowned with lion above the entrance.. Venetian architectural style castle originally built for food and water storage and also served as barracks and prison. Great views from the top of the castle.",
          "Big adventure in a very very big fortress. From the top you can see almost all Heraklion. It's really worth it and it's very cheap: only 2,5 euros.",
          "At this price thought it would be a bit rubbish....but it wasn't. Such good value. Clean, informative and spectacular. Just the sense of history/power and the past so heavy in the air, or was it the salt water.... \ud83d\ude0f",
          "We had a day to spend in Heraklion but not enough time to visit Knossos. The Castello gave us an excellent overview of Heraklion's more recent history as well as providing a respite from the heat of the day and great views of the town. We had wandered into the port area and",
          "The position of this fort gets your attention when you are in the port area of Heraklion, so you take a wander down to take a closer look, and a look back at the town. The sea spray fills the air with a salty taste on the seaward side where the wind and tide whip the waves up.",
          "Nothing special just site to take photo from distance is ok to say I have been here. If you have time you may visit it. but dont expect so much.",
          "We went there in the middle of a very hot day but the road leadung up to it was very breezy which definitely helped. The place was not busy, there is a 2 euro admission fee pp with kids enter free. Plan on spending an hour and half here, on the ground floor the are big, roomy,",
          "I enjoyed a late afternoon visit at the Venetian fort, a great historical ground to learn more about Heraklion, Crete, and Greece. This is very clean facility and helps you stay cool on a hot day in July. This is a great visit for a short time, you can enjoy a long walk down",

          "Excellent visit to a piece of Crete History. 2 euro per adult and we'll worth it! Wonderful building and lovely views and photo opportunities!",
          "This was definitely worth paying the small entrance fee to walk inside and along the top of this impressive fortress. The exhibits inside explain the history of the place which I found interesting. It was very hot when we were there and it was nice to stand on the top to get the",
          "The Venetian fort in Heraklion old harbour is an impressive sight. Take the time to pay the \u20ac2 entrance to see the interior and rooftop views. There is a collection of decorative masonry, amphora, and medieval cannon as well as information boards telling the history of the fort,",

          "A gen! Cheap- only 2 EUR and not crowded when compared to Knossos. We expected much less, just some walls, but the exhibition, though not large, exceeded our expectations, and the views from the top are simply amazing! Great opportunity to take beautifoul pictures or simply",
          "We went there on a Sunday, and just to our surprise, the parking at the port is free on the weekends. Our visit to Castello del Molo (Koules) was beyond our expectations. Not only the access to the Fortress affordable, but also interesting and informative in different",
          "We visited this castle whilst exploring Heraklion. The castle has displays in English and Greek telling the history of Crete, Heraklion and the castle. We paid a couple of euros each to get in. It wasn't expensive.",
          "I have been before but only around the castle. This time I decided to go in. I was really surprised. It was very beautiful and when I went on the top I had e very beautiful view in the front of my eyes.. beautiful harbour,beautiful view of the sea and the city of Heraklion. Very",
          "This was a nice place to walk out to on a hot day. It is cool indoors and the roof affords some spectacular views of the city and coast line. We parked in central parking for a small fee and the walk was about 5 minutes.",

          "The arhetecture is so lovely all the way round the outside or the inside which cost a few euroes to get in. History is all roud this spot and it is easy to see with the photos provided how it once was. A very grand port, and Castle which keep higher ranking soliders and some",
          "The bus system in Crete is excellent. Also you can easily take boats to other parts of Greece. We went to Santorini for one day.",
          "The castle has quite a lot of historical artefacts in it, which are very interesting. The entrance fee was only 4 euros, due to children being free. There weren't a lot of staff on hand for questions and explanations, which is the only reason I'm giving it four instead of five",
          "Very nice view - and great to sit in a restaurant or taverna with the locals and watch the world go by",
          "This attraction is only a five minute walk from Heraklion bus station The views as you walk up to the fortress are of a picturesque harbour with many little boats. We decided to walk along the path to the fortress and you could see stunning views of the green sea to the left",

          "Excellent couple of hours exploring the castle on a really hot day and only two euros each to get in. Highly informative and the views where fabulous would highly recommend jumping on the lock buses and visiting this place.",
          "There is a ton of history presented inside on well written signs. It is probably more worth the visit due to the views of the town and sea. Fun to walk around especially for kids.",
          "The castell is well maintained in the interior and exterior. You may believe really that the Venetian are still there, the canonballs are. The visit costs only 3\u20ac and it really worth it! In conclusion you really should visit it!",
          "My boyfriend and I have ourselves a little \"running tour\". If exercising is your thing- you can jog the whole pier while the sun is setting. It's beautiful!",
          "This castle is an absolute topper in Heraklion, with spectacular view and nice place to take pictures with the typical blue sky of Crete",
          "You can walk along the harbour and gain some basic insight regarding the history of the fort, but its not until your inside that you get more of the detailed history about the Ottoman, Venetian, and Cretan history. quite worth the \u00a32, Be sure to walk to the roof top and get some",
          "Inside you can see the history of the castle, There are ancient cannon and cannon balls. The balls are much larger than the cannon, they said that is just what they found there. Lots of amphorae found during a Jacques Cousteau dive in Crete. Also lots of ballast that were",
          "Paying only 2 EUR as the entrance fee made me quite suspicious what to expect. But it was an amazing trip into the history. Worth to be visited. I have to add great views on the city of Iraklion and the decoration by the wild see due to the very strong north wind.",
          "Built in early 1500s this Venetian fort once protected the harbour. More rooms that I would have guessed and good outdoor access to roof. The remains of the town's boat yard arches can be seen from the roof. Once this was a town like Venice where buildings and water were in",
          "While you are in Heraklion for sure it's a place where you can spend lovely time in for 2 euro which was cheap to inter it or at least you can take a walk around it for free and enjoy the sea and the castle go learn watch and know about the history of the city I loved my time",
          "A Venetian gem with a lot of history and not always that pleasant (the history, not the fort!). It was the very first thing we visited in Herakklion and it immediately gave us a feel for the city, good and elaborate explanations, audioguide was great, has marvellous views from",
          "We got in for free because we were students, but still for only \u20ac2 this place is well worth a visit. The inside structure is fascinating and really large. Lots of plaques and information about the history of the \"fort\" as well. The rooftop terrace area is gorgeous and and",
          "This is a lovely place to visit How ever ... proceed with caution!!! There a Romanian women who try to push beautiful flowers into your hands... once you open your purse/wallet to give some money in return... a small child runs up and grabs your money and runs for it.... to add",
          "The simbol of Heraklion is on the edge of the marina. It was a Venetian fortress for the protection of the old harbor and the city . The site has great views of the marina , the city and to the great boat / ferry arriving to the port . Romantic couple can make nice pictures",
          "Well worth a visit. The port is beautiful, lots of old and new combined. Market - same souvenirs as most other places, but worth a wander. Lots of bars and restaurants. Very hot as quite closed in.",
          "I would highly recommend a visit to Koules if you are in Heraklion. It is only 2 euros to go in so is fantastic value for money. The site also has modern toilets and great views. The fort has recently undergone considerable restoration, this is the reason it got 4 not 5, as the",
          "It was only \u20ac2 entry which I think was good value, there is plenty to read about and all look at. When you go up to the top there are some lovely views across the harbour. We parked our car just nearby for free on a side road and walked right along the harbour before paying",
          "We didn't think the fortress was open to visitors but it was actually really cool. Bigger than it looks and providing a good potted history to Heraklion. At \u20ac2 it is well worth visiting.",
          "A well preserved fortress with lots of information and the displays are laid out so you have a feel of what it could have been like to be stationed at this fortress during a battle or just viewing the horizon watching for enemies. What a beautiful view from they have. Great",
          "Only 2 euro entry to this site (2017) and there was plenty to see. The video was calming and quite reflective but I think could be up-dated. Great views across the harbour.",
          "We visited Koules this morning. It's an interesting fortress but the signs are nearly all in Greek with few translations so not very informative for non-Greek speakers. Inside, you'll find some pottery from ship wrecks, cannons, cannon balls and a little history of Heraklion",
          "This fortress is a must-see. It is quite well preserved and an excellent museum for the history of the city with good explanations about the devastating earthquake, as well as the destruction by the Ottoman's.",
          "We only got to view this from main road as we were lead to believe it is closed on Mondays. It's a stunning building. Can't miss it if you leave the bus station and walk towards to the centre. This is also a stop on the hop off and hop on tour bus.",
          "This Fortress is a magnificent piece of history. Cheap to get in (\u20ac2) but it's not huge, great artefacts inside and detailed information about the Fortress, great views from the top. Definitely recommend visiting it.",
          "We visited the Venetian Marine Fortress of Heraklion (aka Koules) as part of a one-day visit to Heraklion. We were just wandering around the city when we came across the Fortress. We decided to go inside and we were glad we did. There has been quite a lot of work done to make",
          "We visited this incredible fortress at approx 5.00pm, with an advertised closing time of 6.00pm (and last entry of 5.30pm) at the time of our visit. Entry fee is very reasonable, just a few Euro each, and as is the case with all government museums & sites our student daughter",
          "The view is really nice And the have done a really good work of the inside It's a good place to learn history",
          "It was one of those rare cases when the castle is open in the evenings. A musical event with classic pieces. Unfortunately the place was crowded as the event was free",
          "Went there as a local as i live here. So this is a recent renovated place from the ancient times. Just go there. The entrance fee is 1 or 2 euros. After there you can walk along the path to finish the marine road. Have a good time!",
          "Lovely fortress, with nice detailing on the walls. I didn't go inside because I didn't have time but even just looking at it from the outside is worth it!",
          "We visited Koules the venetian fortress in a sunny day of March. You can see the Venetian architecture and admire the port and the city of Heraklion",
          "The Castello Koules at the Heraklio harbour is a splendid example of Roman technology and architecture...having lasted two millenia of storms and weather. Walk along the ramparts to see what things may have been in a different era.",
          "The story of Koules is told briefly but well in the exhibits, and the true delight is in wandering the ramparts--perfectly crenelated-- from one spectacular viewpoint to another.",
          "Koules is an inspiring sight at any time of the day, but I loved seeing it under the stormy sky. It was majestic. It made me contemplate the past when this was the stronghold of the city. How many storms has it faced? How many enemies tried to conquer it even before the Siege of",
          "Well, I was not so amazed by the interiors, but I really loved the 360\u00b0 view from the top of the roof - you can see the harbour and the sea :)",
          "This is one of Heraklion's best historic sites. A recent renewal has been done beautifully. Good signage. Great displays of items recovered from shipwrecks in the area. The upper level offers spectacular views out to sea and across the city. You can get a sense of what it must",
          "The venezian castello is in the harbour and has still his Turkish name Koules; Today is a museum inside and seems an old castel of knights; Massives walls has open arcs, and from here you have a wonderfull seaview and the harbour.",
          "This is one of Heraklion's best historic sites. We visited on a day when huge waves were crashing against the Fort at the harbour entrance which added to the atmosphere. A recent renewal has been done beautifully. Good signage. Great displays of items recovered from shipwrecks",
          "The old Koule castle nearby the sea has been recently renovated and opened to the public. It contained original artifacts (i.e. canons) and also digital multimedia presentations. Its location can be combined with a nice walk by the old Heraklion harbor, by the sea.",
          "Castles, seen one seen them all but for this one the price (3\u20ac) is right and the setting is pretty. There's a display of some of the artifacts they've found under the waters around the bay.",
          "yep only 2 euro to get in with fantastic views and centuries of history , lots to see in side and touch including cannons . lots of artifacts throughout , if your a photographer its heaven with all the views etc. not really suitable for disabled but they are installing ramps",

          "After many years finally the fortress is open to the public. For a small period will be free to enter. Worth a visit especially with children.",
          "Old Venetian fortress looks quite standard. However, it appeared to be impossible to get inside. Possibly views could be quite good from the top.",

          "nice appearance from the outside. closed for update/repairs. has a nice commanding look in the harbor. good history.",
          "Even it was closed due to renovation, the monumentality of this old Venetian fortress is breathtaking. It is also very interesting, how they waited Ottomans here, when the Balkan was already concurred more than two hundred years ago....",
          "I went for a walk on old harbor and saw the Koules Fortress (Heraklion Fortress). It was closed for renovation or something so I couldn't go inside. I did walk around it and it was your average castle/fortress.",
          "There is a beautiful bas relief visible on the Koules and the exterior is beautiful as well. But the building was under renovation so there was fencing and the like surrounding it. It was, nonetheless, a remarkable view from our hotel (Lato) and up close for the detail. The",
          "Unfortunately, we were not able to gain access to the actual fort as renovation was in progress. I realise this is necessary, however, it does mean that I was unable to obtain a close up view.",

          "We walked with my friends at Koules fortress and the \"bypass\" road as locals call it and it was a beautiful afternoon! The fortress is gorgeous and it really worths vising even if you do not have so much time that you walk the road til its end!",
          "Be prepared to walk along the busy seawall to reach the monument. Quite safe as the coast guard car patrols the seawall quite late in the night.",
          "This massive structure features all the Venetian Architecture of the times. Placed in the Heraklion bay with a long Cement Pier that reaches far into the ocean. A nice place to enjoy the sun, fresh air and history. We never got to actually enter the castle as it has been in",
          "Guarding the entrqnce to the old Venetian port, the centruries-old fortress is a place you have to see in Heraklion. Just hand out there drinking a beer etc. If you have time, you can walk to the far end of the promenade (ca. 2km), the so-called \"bypass avenue\", as many patients",
          "Dominating the northern end of the old harbor, this massive Venetian structure once successfully repulsed prolonged assaults. Although it is closed for a long process of repairs to its underwater foundations, it is nevertheless, a favorite place for a stroll, and for locals to",

          "Heraklion Castle in the Venetian harbour and arsenals are a wonderfully preserved historic ensemble. Together with the 25th of August street leading to the city centre through Morosini Fountain or the Lions' Fountain, they are worth a visit and a stroll all along.",

          "This Venitian fort is impressive, the top crenallations were added by the Ottoams, when they finally were able to take it. Many other forts along the coast had already been seized but this one held out. It is currently under renovation and it is not possible to go inside. On",

          "This is where locals go for a walk by the sea. The older ones in the afternoon and the younger ones in the evening. Couples like going at night for some more privacy. What you need to do is go on a weekday in the morning so there's less people.Another tip is to climb up the side",
          "The view is fantastic, the castle next to the sea. It is like you are back at the ages of Venetians. It is very sad that you cannot get inside.",
          "Nice for a leisurely and relaxing walk.....views of the Harbour are pleasant. The Castello is closed to the Public ( and as we understand it has been for some time due to instability) and as a result there is not much to see.",
          "You can walk along the wall out to the end, a very, very long distance. We went in the evening along with a good bit of the city dwellers and tourists. It is safe, somewhat lit up and there was an accordion busker that enhanced our experience. No facilities so plan",
          "Creates a good back drop to the harbour area. It is currently under going extensive restoration so is currently closed, but not sure when it is due to re open. You can walk right up to it and beyond, a nice walk as you can look back on to the harbour and the port area.",
          "They are renovating this site (a very good thing) so you can only walk around it outside. Very impressive. I would have loved to been able to tour the inside.",
          "This venetian fortress was guarding the entrance of the main harbour of Heraklion. Lots of \"history\". Now closed for renovation, it will be very interesting as soon as it is open for visits. Meanwhile, enjoy a great walk around the port and the seawall to get here.",
          "This is the middle century fortress, built by Venetians (looks like). The main problem is - it's closed. But, there is still many interesting things to do around it. First of all - there is a long, 5km shield, that covers the harbor you can walk all the way to the beacon at the",
          "Certainly worth a stroll along the pier that leads to the fortress. On one side there is the calm nice colour waters of the harbour and on the other the waves splashing on the rocks. Easy access from the old town and very close to the venetian arsenals.",
          "Standing there many centuries... Unfortunately you can't visit the inside due to constructions in progress, but the outside view is breathtaking as well. Worthy to spend some time and see it.",
          "This Venetian castle is the landmark of the port of Herakleion and is very beautiful.You can take a walk round it or just sit in a near by cafe and admire it at night.",
          "It was good to get a different perspective on the city. You pass the fort and walk out along the quay and then to a further quay beyond. Lots of graffiti along the way, but great to view the city and port and watch the planes take off from the airport. My pedometer says more",
          "If you're able to view this port, I would highly suggest doing so. It's absolutely breathtaking and a very historically significant site. The surrounding area is also worth the walk. Site seeing is a must in Greece!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Knossos (also Cnossos, both pronounced ; Greek: \u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, Kn\u014ds\u00f3s [kno\u02c8sos]; Linear B: Ko-no-so) is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city.Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete. The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1,380\u20131,100 BC. The reason why is unknown, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.\nIn the First Palace Period (around 2,000 BC), the urban area reached a size of as many as 18,000 people. In its peak, the palace and surrounding city boasted a population of 100,000 people shortly after 1,700 BC.\n\n\n== Spelling ==\nThe name Knossos was formerly Latinized as Cnossus or Cnossos, and occasionally Knossus, Gnossus, or Gnossos but is now almost always written Knossos.\n\n\n== Neolithic period ==\nThe site of Knossos has had a very long history of human habitation, beginning with the founding of the first Neolithic settlement (c. 7,000 BC). Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses, and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.Arthur Evans, who unearthed the palace of Knossos in modern times, estimated that c. 8,000 BC a Neolithic people arrived at the hill, probably from overseas by boat, and placed the first of a succession of wattle and daub villages (modern radiocarbon dates have raised the estimate to c. 7,000\u20136,500 BC). Large numbers of clay and stone incised spools and whorls attest to local cloth-making. There are fine ground axe and mace heads of colored stone: greenstone, serpentine, diorite and jadeite, as well as obsidian knives and arrowheads along with the cores from which they were flaked. Most significant among the other small items were a large number of animal and human figurines, including nude sitting or standing females with exaggerated breasts and buttocks. Evans attributed them to the worship of the Neolithic mother goddess and figurines in general to religion.\n\nAmong the items found in Knossos is a Minoan depiction of a goddess flanked by two lionesses that shows a goddess who appears in many other images.\nJohn Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic. In the Aceramic Neolithic, 7,000\u20136,000 BC, a hamlet of 25\u201350 persons existed at the location of the Central Court. They lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of exogamy, living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\nIn the Early Neolithic (6,000\u20135,000 BC), a village of 200\u2013600 persons occupied most of the area of the palace and the slopes to the north and west. They lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on socles of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the center of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered 50 m2 (540 sq ft). The walls were at right angles. The door was centered. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.\nThe settlement of the Middle Neolithic (5,000\u20134,000 BC), housed 500\u20131000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the center of the main room, and pilasters and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a 100 m2 (1,100 sq ft) area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second story was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the Late or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4,000\u20133,000 BC), the population increased dramatically.\n\n\n== Minoan period ==\n\nIt is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after c. 2,000 BC, in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including Mallia, Phaestos and Zakro. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at Ugarit on the Syrian coast and Mari on the upper Euphrates.The early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before c. 1,700, almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By c. 1,650, they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces (c. 1,650\u2013c. 1,450) marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.The palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the pithoi that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system. A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.Building techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.The prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade. Herodotus wrote that Minos, the legendary king of Knossos, established a thalassocracy (sea empire). Thucydides accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands. Archaeological evidence supports the tradition because Minoan pottery is widespread, having been found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.This also applies to the mainland, because both tradition and archaeology indicate strong links between Crete and Athens. The main legend here is the Minotaur story wherein Athens was subject to Knossos and paying tribute. The legend concerns a creature living in a labyrinth who was half-man and half-bull. Bulls are frequently featured on pottery and frescoes found at Knossos, where the intricate layout of the palace might suggest a labyrinth. One of the most common cult-symbols, often seen on palace walls, is the double-headed axe called the labrys, which is a Carian word for that type of tool or weapon.At the height of Cretan power around 1,450 BC, the palaces at Mallia, Phaestus, and Zakro were destroyed along with smaller settlements elsewhere. Only Knossos remained and it survived until c. 1,370. At the time of its destruction, it was occupied by Greeks, whose presence is suggested by a new emphasis on weapons and warfare in both art and burial. Mycenaean-style chamber tombs had been adopted and there was mainland influence on pottery styles. Confirmation came in written form after Michael Ventris deciphered the Linear B tablets and showed the language to be an early form of Greek that was quite unlike the earlier Linear A. Sir Arthur Evans found the Linear B tablets at Knossos and, although the writing was different from the Linear A ones at Phaestus and elsewhere, he thought they were a development of the first and so called them Linear B.Despite speculation that Knossos was destroyed by the volcanic eruption on Santorini, it is generally accepted that the cause was human violence following an invasion of Crete by Greeks from the Argolid, most probably Mycenaean. Knossos was still prosperous at the time of its destruction c. 1,370 with trade and art continuing to thrive. Explanations for its destruction are speculative, but a likely reason is that the Mycenaeans, now prospering on the mainland, decided to remove a rival power.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nIn Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had Daedalus construct a labyrinth, a very large maze (by some connected with the double-bladed axe, or labrys) in which to retain his son, the Minotaur. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen Ariadne. The name \"Knossos\" was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.\nAs far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos' discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins \"labyrinthine\". Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father is an ancient Greek king named Aegeus, the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth \u2013 a building like a maze \u2013 by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.\nAs it turns out, there probably was an association of the word labyrinth, whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the Mycenaean world as an apotropaic mark: its presence on an object would prevent it from being \"killed\". Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the Aegean. And finally, it appears in Linear B on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, Daburinthoio potniai, \"to the mistress of the Labyrinth,\" recording the distribution of one jar of honey. A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.\n\n\n== Hellenistic and Roman period ==\nFieldwork in 2015 revealed that during the early Iron Age, Knossos was rich in imports and was nearly three times larger than indicated by earlier excavations. Whilst archaeologists had previously believed that the city had declined in the wake of a socio-political collapse around 1,200 BC, the work found instead, that the city had prospered, with its final abandonment coming later.After the fall of the Minoans, Knossus was repopulated approximately 1,000 BC and it remained one of the most important centers of Crete. The city had two ports: Amnisos and Heraklion. According to the ancient geographer Strabo the Knossians colonized the city of Brundisium in Italy. In 343 BC, Knossos was allied with Philip II of Macedon. The city employed a Phocian mercenary named Phalaikos against their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who sent their king Archidamus III against the Knossians. In Hellenistic times Knossos came under Egyptian influence, but despite considerable military efforts during the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC), the Ptolemies were not able to unify the warring city states. In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the Lyttian War in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the Polyrrhenians and the Macedonian king Philip V.Twenty years later, during the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), the Knossians were once more among Philip's opponents and, through Roman and Rhodian aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence. With Roman aid, Knossus became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose Gortys as the capital of the newly created province Creta et Cyrene. In 36 BC, Knossus became a Roman colony named Colonia Iulia Nobilis. The colony, which was built using Roman-style architecture, was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.\nThe identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation 85 m (279 ft) from current sea level. Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse. The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala. The Romans believed they were the first to colonize Knossos.In Christian times, Knossos became a titular see, but during the ninth century AD the local population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion). By the thirteenth century, it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall'; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves bishops of Knossos until the nineteenth century. Today, the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.\n\n\n== Discovery and modern history of the antiquities ==\n\nThe site of Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos. The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941) and his team, and continued for 35 years. Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B, to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present. From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.\nSince their discovery, the ruins have undergone a history of their own, from excavation by renowned archaeologists, education, and tourism, to occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars. This site history is to be distinguished from the ancient.\n\n\n== Palace complex ==\nThe features of the palace depend on the time period. Currently visible is an accumulation of features over several centuries, the latest most dominant. Thus, the palace was never exactly as depicted today. In addition, it has been reconstituted in modern materials. The custom began in an effort to preserve the site from decay and torrential winter rain. After 1922, the chief proprietor, Arthur Evans, intended to recreate a facsimile based on archaeological evidence. The palace is not exactly as it ever was, perhaps in places, not even close, and yet in general, judging from the work put in and the care taken, as well as parallels with other palaces, it probably is a good general facsimile. Opinions range, however, from most skeptical, viewing the palace as pure fantasy based on 1920s architecture and art deco, to most unquestioning, accepting the final judgements of Arthur Evans as most accurate. The mainstream of opinion falls between.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, the terms \"Knossos\" and \"palace\" are somewhat ambiguous. The palace was never just the residence of a monarch, although it contained rooms that might have been suitable for a royal family. Most of the structures, however, were designed to serve a civic, religious, and economic center. The term palace complex is more accurate. In ancient times, Knossos was a town surrounding and including the Kephala. This hill was never an acropolis in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground. These circumstances cannot necessarily be imputed to other Minoan palaces. Phaistos, contemporaneous with Knossos, was placed on a steep ridge, controlling access to the Messara Plain from the sea, and was walled. To what degree Minoan civilization might be considered warlike remains debatable. It can, however, be said that Knossos bore no resemblance to a Mycenaean citadel, whether before or during Mycenaean Greek occupation.The complex was constructed ultimately around a raised central court on the top of Kephala. The previous structures were razed and the top was made level to make way for the court. The court is oblong, with the long axis, which points north-northeast, generally described as pointing \"north\". Plot plans typically show the court with the long axis horizontal, apparently east-west with the north on the right, or vertical with the north on the top. Either arrangement is confusing unless the compass points are carefully marked. About 5 km (3.1 mi) to the north of the palace complex is the sea at the Port of Heraklion. Directly to the south is Vlychia Stream, an east-west tributary of the north-south Kairatos. Kephala is an isolated hill at the confluence.The Kairatos River reaches the sea between the modern port of Heraklion and Heraklion Airport to the east. In ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate. Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.The archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.The Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.\n\n\n=== General features ===\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, Late Minoan. The palace has an interesting layout  \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The 6 acres (24,000 m2) of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers (pithoi) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n\n=== Water management ===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\nAqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs there are the source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at Mycenae.\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained an example of the first known water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a floor drain or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n\nRunoff system. Sloped channels lead from a catchment basin.\nRunoff system. Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.\n\n\n=== Minoan columns ===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height (entasis), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.\n\n\n=== Pottery ===\n\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n\n=== Frescoes ===\n\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed fresco panel murals, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground hematite. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh stucco with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.The decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: humans, legendary creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.\n\n\n=== Throne room ===\n\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called Throne Room or Little Throne Room, dated to LM II. This chamber has an alabaster seat identified by Evans as a \"throne\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a lustral basin, which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on seal rings, which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n\nThe seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"heraldic arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the Mycenaeans would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\nA room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess, who would have sat in the throne, either in effigy, or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of divinity rather than a heraldic motif.Additional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\nA long-standing debate between archaeologists concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a theocratic manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of Bronze Age Crete, and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the Mycenaeans, although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAenesidemus (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\nChersiphron (sixth century BC) architect\nEpimenides (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\nErgoteles of Himera (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\nMetagenes (6th century BC) architect\nMinos (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagasa\nTrapeza\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwindale, Ian. \"Minoan Crete website: Knossos Pages\".\n\"Knossos\".

          "The Ruins of Knossos are something interesting to see in Cretan history. But in general it is overrated. if you are In Heraklion Then that\u2019s fine but as we traveled 160km it was not worth it.",
          "The guides there cost 10\u20ac per person and they wait for a group 10 people or you can get a private tour for 100 \u20ac I noticed English, German and French guides looking for people to give tours to when we visited. They wait outside the entrance till they have enough people. There",
          "Great place to visit. We did a trip with Jet2 and thoroughly enjoyed it, our guide, Gregory, was very informative. We spent the morning at Knossos and then on to Heraklion where we had free time for a walk around before going into the museum. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get long",

          "We took a taxi from Heraklion that cost EUR8 and only took 10 minutes. We caught the bus back and cost EUR5 for both of us and took 15 minutes. This is a huge place and you could spend hours here. In the restoration process, they\u2019ve taken a few extra steps trying to recreate how",

          "We enjoyed the visit to this historic sight. It is well signposted and the explanatory signboards are instructive. There is a lot to see so it takes several hours if you want to fully appreciate it. It was crowded in October so in peak season it must be much more difficult to",
          "Knossos is wonderful and totally worth it but be prepared to fight the crowds unless you get there early. It's worth hurrying to get there before the buses arrive!! The restorations help to give it a real life feel. Be sure to see the amazing display in the archaeological",
          "Really nice visit. We got there early, got a parking spot, also got in fast. All was as expected. A lot of rocks. I would've liked some more pictures of reconstructions. I had a Lonely Planet travel guide and it helped a bit, but still was hard to imagine all the things by",

          "Even in October it\u2019s a hot day out and parking was tricky but free. Take plenty of water and allow lots of time so you can stop in the tiny patches of shade. We went without a guide (human or book) which may have been a set back. It\u2019s a massive site and very difficult to tell",
          "We took the guided tour, which I think have us a much better insight into the palace. The parts of the site that have been reconstructed give a good idea just how well designed, grand & culturally significant the palace and the civilisation which built it.",
          "The sheer scale of the palace is astonishing and, given its ancient history, it is in good shape. I guess those ancient Greeks knew how to build!",
          "A tour guide is a must to have everything explained to you. Very interesting and educational. A trip to the Archaeology museum afterwards paints a clearer picture of what was seen.",

          "First stop after arriving in Knossos and buying our entry tickets was a coffee and a fresh orange juice. Wow - 8.50 Euros for 2 drinks! Entry was 15 euros each. The Palace covers quite a big area, with lots of steps up and down, and lots of staff to make sure you don't touch",

          "Bit of a conflict for archaeology buffs ! but fantastic for lay people wanting to understand who the Minoans were. The archaeologist in the early 1900's rebuilt parts of the palace with concrete to show what it looked like. But it is obvious which is original and which is",
          "We had done our research and knew roughly what to expect. Firstly, some tips: Arrive early even off season. There is a free car park next to the site and was half empty at 10am. At 10am there was no queue in mid October for the Cassa, We are Univerity members and ID card",
          "Its truly a remarkable place, so old with so much history. Gets very busy and guided tours can be a problem. We just got a taxi there (Not organised tour) but everywhere there are information boards to let you know some of the history. Its the second most visited place in Crete",
          "Knossos is a nice and interesting historic place. There is many free parking for cars and bus in front of palace. There is a lot of shops and tavern in front of palace. The walk is pleasant and interesting around the great palace!We are glad that some parts of the palace are",

          "We visited the Palace of Knossos while in Heraklion for 1.5 days. It was worth the trip (but not one of the best archaeological sites I've been to). Things I think I did right: 1- Got there by the #2 Bus. it cost 1.70 Euros/person (It's the #20 bus to go back). It took",
          "Even with some knowledge of the history it failed to keep us interested. The reconstruction was necessary but it has taken away the ambiance and impact of the site. Nevertheless we had moments where we could immerse ourselves and imagine we were there 4000 years ago which was",
          "Moving experience to be in the midst of that much history. Fantastic archeological site that makes you feel insignificant in the grand scheme of life",
          "An off peak visit as early as 8am is advised as there are lots of pinch points. Even off peak there were queues to see the more popular places in the palace. I found the amount of concrete off putting, in spite of understanding how and why there was so much. Do wear decent",
          "Fab place. So interesting. However going on a tour with English tourists being the minority meant we had a lot of waiting about to hear what was next. If you can, go earlier in the morning before the coaches arrive. I think it's open from 8am",
          "Interesting place to visit due to the historical and archaeological importance of it. Nothing impressive and the guide prices are a rip off.",
          "This was first palace ever built during they believe during Neolithic area. It\u2019s associated with the dwelling of the Minotaur in Greek mythology called the labyrinth .",
          "As expected, Knossos is amazing, really worth the price ticket, especially when buying the combined ticket with the archeological museum of Heraklion. Really recommend for ancient history nerds like myself",
          "An easy public bus trip and this amaziong ancient palace is your's if you go at opening time. Enjoy and walk around and absorb the ancient history before the crowds. We got there before 9, avoided the heat and the crowds, we were able to explore, and take photos in solitude. By",

          "We have been to Knossos a few times and it changes every time we go. It is a fascinating place and really worth seeing. It is so hard to believe that they were so advanced as a race with washing and toilet facilities. You can also go to the Museum in Heraklion to see all the",
          "This has been on my 'to.do' list for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. You need to do this in conjunction with the museum in Heraklion to see all that was found there.",
          "I just have to say I enjoyed the tours I receive through TUI while in Crete. Especially the guide Veta. We had her on a tour of Heraklion, the archeology museum and Knossos and then another day in Elounda, Spinaloga, and St. Nicholaos. She was the BEST guide we have ever had",
          "We went to the Palace of Knossos on two occasions, once with a tour operator tour and once separately. On both occasions, the palace was beautiful. A lot of time and effort has been put into the location to make it as informative and fascinating as possible. From the",
          "Great site to visit - gets very busy and quite a lot of queueing so go early. We took a guide (\u20ac100 shared between 2 couples) - well worth the money as got an excellent historical review. Really enjoyed the site but gets busy. Phaestus is as good as less busy.",
          "But get a guide. We farms a great guide and it was well worth it. I would not want to go without one.",
          "This pile of rocks is mostly made up of replicas that may or may not be historically accurate. Don\u2019t waste your time. If you want to support local tourism then go to the island itself as it\u2019s a beautiful place, but if you want a more historical and engaging experience either",
          "A fascinating archaeological site, Evans did his work well to give an insight into life in Minoan times. We went late in the afternoon, to be recommended as the crowds were thinner and the heat less intensive. Well worth a visit!",
          "If you are a \u201cvisitor of palaces\u201d don\u2019t expect to see a place at Knossos. There is a series of ruins and a lot of walking on uneven surfaces. There are a few surviving friezes but this is 4000 years old so don\u2019t think of it as a Cretan Versailles. However on entering you are",
          "My husband and I visited in September which was still very hot. Although it is amazing to see how the palace might have looked most of the site was reconstructed by a British archeologist which is disappointing. However still worth going to. We also saw a beautiful peacock",
          "It's a wonderful place by itself, but I really recommend to have the guide here. We had a wonderful guide, who was passionate about the whole story and the visit was really unforgettable. In combination to the Palace of Knossos I recommend to visit Archaeological museum in",
          "What is there to review ..Amazing but be sure to go to the Museum in Heraklion later to see the artifacts associated with the site..",
          "Eight of us took the open bus that drops you off right in the parking lot so you don't have to walk too far. Get there early and purchase your ticket there. We decided to get their tour guide and certainly glad we did. If we didn't I would have the same reaction as the other",
          "You don\u2019t need my opinion on this historical site but I will leave you some tips. Don\u2019t buy tickets in advance the line goes quickly. If you can...buy the combined ticket and do the palace first then the museum\u2014 the museum will enhance your palace experience and put it kind of",
          "Very very crowded with groups standing around listening to their guides blocking the small walkways and route. Lots of rubble with small areas reconstituted to give you a feel of the place but it just didn\u2019t do it for me. Visit the museum instead as you\u2019ll get more out of it.",
          "Yes this is an important historical site. BUT. Crowded to the hilt with crocodiles of tourist bus groups blindly following their leader.Sadly the reconstruction or 'interpretation' has been undertaken in reinforced concrete which looks just plain wrong.Get a guide book first",
          "Definitely worth a visit being a live archaeological dig. Wear suitable footwear as the paths are uneven.",
          "I realize that most reviews are positive for this site but I will have to disagree. The place is super crowded with tour buses in a relatively small archeological site. I felt like a salmon swimming upstream. Most of the site is not much more than rubble and the few things that",
          "If you ask at the entrance they will tell you can enter and easily go around with a stroller. It is not completely true. Most of the rooms are not accessible. So I wouldn't recommend it to small children. Site is amazing and there is lot to discover. But you will have to use",
          "It is quite a large site. Wear a hat. If over 65 you get in for half price if you have id. Take a drink with you.",
          "Don't get me wrong this place is worth visiting if you are in the area but in terms of archaeological importance in world wide, let alone European, significance there are more interesting and better things to see. However, the Museum of Archaeology in nearby Heraklion is well",
          "I felt like we could have done this in a lot less time. I've toured many sites in Egypt and was slightly disappointed that most of what you saw here was re-created, but necessary, as the original burned a few times (and was made largely of wood). Strongly recommend a quick (1",
          "If you come to Crete by ferry or plane you'll most likely begin your journey in Heraklion. Not to be missed, the Palace of Knossos and the Heraklion Archaeology Museum (visit them both in that order) are fascinating, interesting and incredible. You will learn all about the",
          "For us 30\u00b0 for this attraction was super hot. It is essential to get tour-you will understand more,otherwise is is just ruins and some other things. The history of the place is amazing and it should be a nr. 1 place to go in Crete.",
          "It's a great place, with old history, very old. It's easy access, great view. Be early, before all busses will come. It gets really busy. And hard to get good photos, and to enjoy this place, when it gets crowded. So go early, and it will be great. If you like history, it's a",
          "What an amazing experience to see how people lived so many years ago. A truly wonderful experience would recommend to people of all age groups",
          "Visited at about 2pm after the coach parties had gone and before the cruise liner guests arrived. Decided to hire a guide - best thing we could have done as a guide gives much more colour and information to the tour. Well worth it. Fascinating how the Legend of the Labyrinth",
          "Knossos is a very important site archaeologically and historically, a main centre of Minoan culture. It is large with same extensive remains. It is worth visiting for these reasons. That said, compared with similar archaeological sites, it has major drawbacks which greatly",
          "A great place to visit. Very interesting. We were lucky to avoid the coach tours as I imagine it would be extremely busy in high season. 50c to use the ladies toilet ! Concessionary rates for over 65s if you produce ID. We used our driving licenses.",
          "A very nice site with some restoration to encourage your imagination as to the past greatness of the past. The site is easy to find and access. Plenty of parking if you are driving. I personally like the restoration that has been done. There is also a very beautiful view of the",
          "We were lucky to arrive in early afternoon after the crowds had cleared out which made it very easy to walk around. It was much more extensive than I thought and the restorations were done in a way to keep the history alive. Certainly makes one very humbled by their engineering",
          "This is of course a five star attraction, but just to make a point of the conservation and presentation: Four points in stead of five. The Palace of Knossos is extremely interesting and shoud not be missed. If you visit Crete and have the least chance to go to Knossos: You",
          "I came to here with a couple of friends. We thought we could google the facts and follow the map ourselves and read the plaques ourselves. But the site is large and the buildings are at least 50% rubble, therefore I recommend paying for a guide. It will give you history, fun",
          "Well worth a visit for anyone interested in Greek history. It is huge and beautiful and incredibly clever. It is just an amazing place and if you are not happy going around by yourself then there are tour guides available. We quite happily meandered for a few hrs without",
          "Amazing place if you like history.we didn't have much time but managed a good short visit of 2 hours. Best go early at opening time 0800 to avoid queues either getting tickets or getting in.also you can then avoid large tour groups. By doing this you should be able to have",
          "I am definitely a fan of Greek antiquity and this might be my 4th or 5th trip here over 40 years. It never disappoints. Each time I brought with me people who were unfamiliar with the history but left an appreciator. I always hire a licensed guide at the site and learn more each",
          "If you are a litle bit interested of a Greek history, that is a must see. You need 2-3 hours time, a botle of watter and a shield hat, And if you go in the morning, there are not so many people.",

          "Unless you\u2019re a real fan of boring archeological digs, skip this one! Much of it\u2019s reconstruction is the vision of one man & not entirely based on facts. There is very little to see & the price was 15 Euros. It took us about 30 min. to see the whole thing. Had tour guides",

          "Smaller space than I remember but the space has certainly been maintained well (20 years). There are informative plaques that describe the remains. All in all, a good representation of the Minoan lifestyle. However, would recommend reading up on the Minoans and the site",
          "I think the reason it's so popular is for the kudos of being able to say that you went there. Otherwise it's underwhelming. The site is not 'huge' so no chance of getting lost in a 'labyrinth' or feeling atmospherically bamboozled. It is well signed so no need for a rip",
          "Ok, for me overall rating is 3,5. It's ok - it's not a WOW effect - but maybe my rate is because of visit during high season. Then is so overcrowded place and heat. If you want to see Knossos - it's better to buy combined ticket in Archeological Museum - then you will avoided",

          "Good place to visit, if history and ancient stories are of interest to you. It's surrounded by trees, therefore it's easy to find a shadow during the heat, you can go also in a hot day.",

          "I already knew the story of Knossos & Arthur Evans\u2019 questionable (to put it mildly) excavation & recreation. 95% of the things here are fake & I call it archeology Disney Land because he used reinforced concrete & paint to try and make the site look the way he thought it should.",
          "It\u2019s hard to say just how accurate is this representation of the actual palace. But the archaeologist used the materials on site and his experiences to refabricate the area. Pretty interesting if you ask me.",
          "Overcrowded. Guides try to intercept you before you can walk to the ticket office. The woman at the ticket office was super unfriendly. We had official transcripts that we were all students, and only one friend of us had the student card with her. The woman only allowed the free",
          "After 10 weeks in Greece, we are over ruins, but saying that we actually enjoyed this site, for better than Olympia. Whilst they are ruins there a noumerous part buildings that give you a good Insite into what a magnificent palace this once was. Entry fee 15 euro pp. In",

          "As much as I love the history of this place, the ruins are just not so impressive because it is so hard to tell what is remade and what isn't. Concrete is dominant there. It is a place worth seeing though, but I feel it has been tampered with too much to feel like an ancient",
          "We had an excellent guide who knew the site well, she gave us a real insight into the minoan civilization through her tour and talk. Well worth the entry price. We had a joint Knossos/Archeology museum ticket which was excellent value. Sadly the toilet facilities were inadequate",
          "As our guide told us, people here had a sewage system and air conditioned about 4000 years ago - what more could you say about it. Even if it was extremely warm, the visit is a refreshing one as there are some areas with shadow and with its own ventilation system.",
          "An iconic place to visit if you are in Crete. We took a 1 hour and 30 min visit with an italian guide than explained all about the palace, the way they lived and worked. Suggest to take a licensed guide for the visit. We paid 16 eur for 1 ticket that included the museum in",
          "We took up an offer of a guide and so glad we did! Eva, our guide was so informative and helpful. Full of knowledge and eager to pass it on! Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have learnt half as much! Knossos was amazing!",

          "What a privilege to be able to walk in King Minos\u2019 footsteps and to get a feel for the place where his people\u2019s impressive civilisation had its heart.

          "This was the least impressive archeological site we visited on our trip. It was the most expensive site we visited and was the least impressive. It was crowded, lines were long, lots of large tour groups. Would not rush to this site.",

          "The Knossos Palace is a wonderful historical site of the Minoans. Very worth a visit if you ever go to Crete. Tip: Go early.",
          "Important - first, take a private guide (around 10 euro per person in small groups) otherwise a visit to the ruins is going to be of little use. Second, take a ticket combined with the national museum in Heraklion. It costs 1 euro more and there you are going to find all things",
          "Get a guide would be my advice. There is not enough signs to explain the history of the objects and meaning behind them. Easy to get to by bus.",

          "There is a danger of the Palace of Knossos failing to meet expectations. It is, after all, a site of significant historical importance so it would be easy to think that it will be dazzling. However, there is not much remaining to see. The ruins are at least 4000 years old; the",
          "I had high hopes on this archeological site but what a big disappointment when you see that almost all the ruins have been partially rebuilt with concrete by the excavator Arthur Evans ... I have seen far better in Italy for example.",

          "I was looking forward to visiting with my son (a recent history graduate with a keen interest in Greek mythology) but came away disappointed. The tour groups were not the problem nor the tour guides. It was the site itself which seems to have been bent to the will of one man -",
          "Wanted to visit and was content to queue and share the site with many others but it was not worth it... A sad example of how one archaeologist, Arthur Evans, destroyed what remained of what must have been an important site. Almost everything above ground has been created by him,",
          "It was very busy due to cruise ships trips being there on the same day, which was a shame as people were pushing past and through other tour groups. The floor, as you would expect is uneven, so not good for anyone who is not great on their feet. All in all a good day out, but it",

          "Knossos is a letdown. The site is very busy, and the tour groups climb all over the site. Some of the worst tourists I've ever seen were at Knossos, blithely going past the ropes, even right in front of a guard who was busy scolding someone else for doing the same thing seconds",

          "Given it is 3,500-4,000 years old the stone structures are impressive. Reconstruction is in progress and authentic walls and some interpretation is evident. Archeological students and historical buffs will be keen to imagine how humans live so long ago. In terms of",
          "Got here but should have realised that was going to be busy as a cruise ship in port. Large que when we got here, but walked straight through with guide we took on , which I would recommend as learn a lot more about the place than reading the boards scattered all over the place.",

          "The combined ticket for the palace and museum is great value, catch the number 20 bus outside to get between the two. Paid for the guide and went round as a group of six, i feel paying for the guide is worth it if you want to know all about what you are looking at, the info",
          "My husband and I did this on our own. We got to the site just as it was opening; before all the tour groups arrived. We walked the site on our own at our leisure. It is so amazing how big it is and all the structures inside. We really liked it and by the time we were leaving all",

          "Arrived here at 11.20 (just at its hottest and busiest!!) And was greeted by a Greek lady asking if we wanted a tour in English. We agreed for 10\u20ac each. Only 3 of us in the end so jumped to the front of tickets queue (8\u20ac each) and skipped the toilet queue too as the guides have",
          "Firstly either get there for opening time or after 2pm as it is heaving between 10:39am & 2pm. The site will give you hours of interest but you do need to sit and read the guide every so often to appreciate what you are seeing. As much as I hate being corralled some directional",
          "Very interesting place well worth a visit but make sure you have a guide, it\u2019s unbelievable just how advanced they were",
          "Well impressed with the hole thing but our tour guide was like a mountain goat she was hot on her feet",
          "I always love a good ruin, and Knossos is absolutely the \"must see\" on Crete. It's in an absolutely stunning setting, with glorious views over the surrounding countryside, and overall they have done a good job of preserving as much as they can. It's almost as much fun to get an",
          "The signs falsely says \"Students of EU Free\". But by the entrance they don't accept student cards if they don't deem the university big or good enough (too subjectively). My sister is from the biggest ones of Denmark which was declined and I have an (supposedly) international",

          "Recommend you visit this early in day in summer with a bottle of water as it gets really hot and although there is shade there\u2019s lots of exposed areas too. Think entrance was \u20ac15 each and you self guide yourself round. It takes about an hour I think and it really is amazing",
          "My advise is to visit the Palace in combination with the archeological museum in Heraklion. You can buy a combination ticket at the gate of the Palace. From the Palace it is a 15 minutes drive by car to the museum in Heraklion. The Palace is wonderful and, as we understand,",

          "Found this site interesting but feel they should try to give you a better layout of what it would have looked like. This was at the museum in Heraklion but should have been at the entrance at Knossos.",

          "Very few people have not heard about Knossos. It is roughly 10 kms outside Heraklion. South. And the remains date from 5000 years ago! The myth gives the King Minos and the Minataur a date in the second millennium BC. And it is have been reconstructed ! BUT there some frescos",
          "A huge complex with deep history and interesting architectural design. I highly recommending visiting this in the morning as it will get quite hot near noon. After visiting this site, I suggest going to the archaeological museum in the afternoon to view more of the artefacts",
          "Difficult to get a feel for what it used to be like. Would benefit from having something like a visitor centre to explain everything. Only a relatively small part of the site is accessible by wheelchair and even those bits are a bit tricky. Glad I went though because this is the",

I think it\u2019s much better to do it by yourself and not with an",
          "This was a lovely little trip to see the ruins I would suggest getting a tour guide they are hovering outside and will ask you if you are interested in a guide for a small fee it makes the tour round much more interesting and very informative to the back story of the ruins.",
          "Had a great time looking around the palace, there are sign posts around the area which give a description of the different buildings in English. For more information it would be better to have a guide, we didn\u2019t do this as the guides were expensive on the day but we found the",
          "We did this place ourselves instead of a guided tour which if I'm honest looked very tiring and slow.....the place has a lot of history as you would expect....I would say the a maximum of 2 hours will see you round the palace.....good and drinks are available. I would suggest",

          "Quite a big area, but there aren't the columns and statues that you find at other similar sites. Anything that is interesting is a recreation done in the 20s. We decided to travel independently from Malia. It cost us around 28 euros in bus fares and entry tickets. The organised",

          "A must see monument of Minoan civilization. Better to visit early in the morning to avoid the high temperatures in July and August.",
          "A must see to contextualize all the objects in the Archeological Museum. Both experiences are crucial to one another. The reconstructions are troubling in not knowing what is original and what is reconstructed but Knossos gives the over all understanding of the breadth and depth",

          "We booked a guided tour to The Palace of Knossos as it was recommended by our TUI rep 'you don't visit Crete without visiting Knossos'. Our guide had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Cretan and tried her best to make the tip interesting and fun. This place is of course",
          "The most boring trip ever. Location is almost in town, not spectacular, crowded. A lot of small closed spaces with stone walls. Is common sense that the Minotaur myth appeared here. And is so expensive..15 euros not well spent..Balos Lagoon is for 1 euro They sell also tickets",
          "Really interesting, well laid-out. There are buses that stop outside, although we had a hire car (it's well-signposted and easy to find). There's a free car park next to it, and a nice, sensibly-priced cafeteria inside. Definitely take water, sunscreen and a hat. Even the",

          "This was an amazing day out. Firstly visiting the Palace then the museum in Heraklion where we saw such well preserved artefacts many of which dated from 1400 ad and older. Definitely worth a visit. You will not be disappointed!",
          "Our tour guide was not ideal and didn\u2019t teach us much in way of information. Simply explaining oh here is the drainage system and some nice pictures. Don\u2019t understand why we wasn\u2019t allowed around on our own.",
          "The site ofcourse is interesting and important, but the fee was far too expensive just to walk around. If you are not too familiar with the history make sure to take a guided tour so you understand where you are.. we didn\u2019t and we\u2019re not too happy.",
          "A full ticket is 15\u20ac. The tickets were supposed to be free for students, however, an ISIC card and foreign high school cards were not accepted. Seeing as Knossos and the Minoan culture is the cradle of European civilization, I don't see why tickets are necessary in the first",
          "The Palace of Knossos is mostly in ruins, so you either have someone explaining the amazing history behind it, or the place is not worth visiting. I was amazed with what I learned about the minoan civilization with my guided tour!",

          "Bit of a disappointment. Tours are strictly policed, no scope for exploration or spending too long on one area. Interesting none the less.",
          "This was not the best ruins visit I have ever been to and it was quite pricey (15 euros each, student rate is half but they don't accept international student cards so bring your uni card). It can be quite hot up there, so don't go on the hottest day! It was packed with tourists",
          "Famously found by an English archaeologist (Evans), early in the 20th century, he attempted to reconstruct parts of the site. Purists, are horrified, but I felt it enhanced the site. A worthy visit.",

          "Been a few times but this was definitely the best. Ear pods and an iPad made the whole experience a lot more interesting and interactive. I love the fact that they are discovering new things all of the time. Theory is that there is another palace under the current one. Must go",
          "Very disappointed with Knossos. It has been restored even more than when we last visited it 40 years ago. Crowds of tourists and very many tour groups blocking the views.",
          "What a load of rubbish , modern interpretations of what Arthur Evans from Oxford University at the turn of the century thought that it should like and parts of it have been rebuilt to reflect his vision. Site information stated \u20ac6 but actually cost \u20ac15. Don't waste money and",

          "Fascinating site but the subject of some clumsy renovations and speculation about how the palace was used. Go early-it was heaving by the time we left. We would very much recommend getting a guide other wise as someone put it, it's just a bunch of old ruins. We would also",
          "We joined a tour group for this historic site and apparently so did most of Crete at the same time. We were hustled through, the guide had to yell to be heard above other guides, a strange long que had to be formed to quickly take a picture of a throne replica and even more",

          "This place broke my heart. \u20ac15 each to enter (\u20ac0.50 if you wanna dry your hands in the toilet!) and the entire palace is paved over in concrete by Arthur Evans.

          "Had a very good guide leader lady called Sofia. She was really passionate about telling the history all the way at Palace. Had a good time, was taking about 2hs to have whole round. Was a load of change to make photos. Suggested to come in trainer shoes.",
          "Out of this world!",
          "Very interesting site. Definitely worth getting a tour guide although they generally want \u20ac100 per group to take a tour. This is separate from the entrance fee. Get a combined ticket for this site and the archaeological museum in the town as it's quite good value.",
          "Fantastic place, advise to everyone.",
          "Consider to visit since due to Covid-19 situation half of the site is closed but the price is still same. The only benefit is less amount of people.",
          "A place that everyone should visit, but not in this period! Majority of the paths are closed due to \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, thus it\u2019s possible to visit only a small part of the site. Please consider that the price doesn\u2019t have any discount due to the smaller path and at the entrance no one is going to tell you about this!",
          "It was my 4th time visiting this magical place and I enjoyed it again. It never gets boring. Students get in for free. It's fun to talk about Greek mythology there, especially about the minotaur and Theseus who made his way to the labyrinth (even if you can't find it there)",
          "Such a beautiful place and full of history. We really enjoyed our visit. We got the combined tickets from the Archeological Museum (16\u20ac) and took a bus to the Palace (1.70\u20ac - one way) which you can get from outside the museum or along the \u2026",
          "Interesting history within this place. Almost empty during the pandemy time.",
          "This is the world famous site of Knossos. It is an early 20th century palace constructed by the proto-archaeologist Arthur Evans. It is an amazing site to behold and is perhaps the best example of the neo-fantastical archaeological style of \u2026",
          "Lots of interesting rooms and structures to look at. A bit spread out to be out in hot weather, but there plenty of shade at the back of the site. Really good value as children under 18 go in free.",
          "You should visit it early in the morning to avoid the crowds :-) and to be hones I was expecting something more for example it could be better described how to explore it. Without a professional guide it can be chaotic.",
          "It's good with lots of signage. I went at 5pm so it was nice and quiet. It's a shame that the reconstructions cover such a large amount of the site. As an archaeology graduate I prefer Malia Palace to Knossos",
          "Great historical place where you can check out some nice ancient relics. Be sure to tag along a guided tour in order to listen to the full story. Recommending 100%",
          "Interesting ruins and a lovely organic cafe nearby \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0b",
          "Great historic day out",
          "A bit overpriced for the entrance fee",
          "If you like history you cannot miss this. The feeling of being at a place where first known European civilization came up is amazing. On a hot day make sure you have water. Parking is available and there are a few Taverns too.",
          "Great for an hour or two. You can find guides for various languages standing outside the main entrance. The local cafe is ok but be prepared to wait a bit if they\u2019re busy.",
          "Unfortunately one of the victims of the commercialisation of our Greek tourism.\n\nThe ticket is absolutely not worth the experience that one gains from the visit, especially if one is Greek and expects a visualisation of our history.\nMany \u2026",
          "Knossos is an amazing archeological treasure that preserves the ancient Minoan civilization, the first advanced civilization in Europe.\n\nAs you walk through the incredibly well preserved ruins you can imagine the Minotaurs roaming the \u2026",
          "A really interesting place to visit, we paid for a tour as well as the entrance price which was about Euro 26 each but was well worth the money as it really helped get an idea for what happened at the palace. Anyone thinking of visiting \u2026",
          "Overly long visit to see a lot of reconstruction that looked like a Hollywood film set. Most interesting parts were not open to the public, obviously we can't be trusted. Give it half an hour of your time.",
          "Nothing much to see at the site except for ruins. The Heraklion museum is much better!",
          "Pretty nice place to visit but due to covid19, many places are closed and a price reduction would be welcome",
          "Very interesting trip to Knossos Palace\nOur guide was very informative and we learned at lot about the history of the Palace\nDefinitely work a look. It is very busy but ques go down pretty quickly and there are places to shade as it is very hot",
          "Great place to visit. Fantastic history. Shame they rebuilt a lot of it previously and that access to the labyrinth is no longer accessible (not at this location) would definitely go again and spend longer here.",
          "We visited here on our own rather than with an organised trip. The tour companies offer an augmented reality device which looked  useful. We downloaded an app on our phone at a small cost. The car parking was free, the site is interesting \u2026",
          "Nice palace if you are passionate about history. Was disappointed they had no minotaurs",
          "Great ruins to explore with helpful info boards. Big site so you can easily spend 1.5 to 2 hours here. If going in peak, go early (8am) to avoid crowds. 15 minute bus from Heraklion which cost 1.5 euro each way.",
          "Amazing site. Go with a guide to get the full experience. The story brings the place alive. Can't give 5 stars as it is way to touristy, the amount of visitors takes from the overall experience",
          "A fun quick trip from Heraklion, a must see if you have the time. However, the area is very small, it definitely won't require a full day. There are explanatory signs of the site and walking tours available. The entire experience took me about an hour.",
          "I have wanted to visit this place for many years. Sadly, my experience there was not what I had expected. At our arrival we were instantly approached by tour guides, who were pushy and annoying. We then heard one of them telling some non \u2026",
          "very good !",
          "Interesting relativ smalle. Rember to buy a combi tricket that includes the archaeological Museum",
          "Amazing place to visit. I definitely recommend it to everyone. You can easily sink 1-2 hours without realising it. There is a small but fairly good restaurant near the entrance. You are surrounded by trees which makes the scene even better. Be sure to check the weather before you visit however.",
          "I guess it's a nice place but I didn't get in. Most places I visited in Greece including eg. Mycaene have student tickets. Here even with a Greek student card, they want the full price only depending on the age. There are people under 25 \u2026",
          "Amazing and worth the trip. If you go, ask for Eva as your tour guide if she's available. She's great!!!! Photos do not do it justice. A must see.",
          "Good place to see if You are interested in Greece mithology and history. Ticket It\u2019s for 15\u20ac but if You will be in Heraklion first You can buy ticket for knosos and all Heraklion museums for 20\u20ac.\nDown to the road It\u2019s grat tradutional tavern.",
          "Total rip off!! 15\u20ac for half of the site being closed due to Covid and NO ONE tells you!! Terrible. You need 5min to see everything. Don\u2019t go now!! Wait for the pandemic to be over",
          "Great history but really not a lot to see. Make sure you go on a day with a breeze or it can be brutally hot. Worth buying the ticket for an extra euro which gives you entrance to the antiquities museum in the centre of Heraklion for free. Check out my review of rust.",
          "Good historical place to visit if you are in Crete. Price is not huge so don't worry to spend a lot of money to have a tour. I used a tour guide and was able to understand everything about the palace and it's history. You will have a good \u2026",
          "I like it a lot, especially the work of the architects and the efforts they put into restoration process. This allows me to imagine the colors of the 3500 years ago.",
          "Amazing place of historical significance.  B.C.",
          "I have been to Knossos more than a handful of times and it never fails to bring a smile to my face. All visitors to Crete should attempt to visit this place and familiarise themselves with the history of the Minoan civilization. Great early \u2026",
          "Lots of great history here. However, I was a but put off by the extent of the restorations as it was often quite hard to tell what was original and what has been restored and it gave the place a bit of a fake feeling due to the volume of concrete and added architecture",
          "A palace set up in a very beautiful location.  Unbeatable building culture.  I recommend.",
          "One of the most impressive ancient buildings in the world. Magnificent. The Minoan civilization was really something to admire.",
          "If you want to stay blissfully ignorant, then this is a no brainer pass \ud83d\ude09 If not, enter a world of enlightenment. Absolutely amazing and straight out of History Channel.",
          "Place seems interesting but only with the guide (which we didn't take)",
          "Very cool history here but overall didn\u2019t feel like there was all that much to see. Was a lot smaller than we imagined. The peacocks were cool though.",
          "Marvelous! Easy to get there by bus. It's a pity that don't have audio guide to rent. Nice in the end of summer, not to hot with a good breeze.",
          "perfect place. Incretible History",
          "Wonderful historical site. Very interesting and worth a couple of hours to visit. Make sure you take a guidebook or have a guide. Get there early to avoid the crowds and tour groups.",
          "Fascinating part of Greek / Minoan history. I went with my parents and we took part in a group guided session. The guide was very knowledgeable and did the tour at a manageable pace, without being too slow. It was interesting to be able to \u2026",
          "Pretty impressive!!!\nStill 15eu per person entry is a bit steep imho.\nThere's lots of guides trying to lure you along. If you don't have much in this could help with the sightseeing.\nThere's a lot to see it appears but in reality you'll be \u2026",
          "The tour guide was a lovely old lady, she clearly loved what she was doing and knew the place like the back of her hand. It was one of the best executed tours I've seen in a while. Just remember to bring a hat, it can get really hot!",
          "One of the top historical sites you need to visit in Crete. However, it can become really boring if you do not choose a guided tour of the palace. Otherwise, reconstruction quality is worthy of an hour of your time and also the wild pracocks",
          "Very nice palace with exciting murals.",
          "What a wonderful place to visit! This is worth the visit. Also purchase the combo ticket for the site and the museum. I highly recommend a guide to learn all the nuances of the Palace of Knossos.",
          "It's one of those places you have to see.... But when you read the plaques you start to understand what the place may have actually looked like.... Huge... And for crete would have definitely stood out.",
          "Fascinating historical  place.  Nicely maintained  ruins.  Incredible wall paintings.  Busy with tourists. Wear good shoes.",
          "An ancient palace dug up by an eccentric brit, what's not to like?\nFew things you should know: it's hot! Obviously it's Greece but when I say hot, I mean hot. There is little shade and nowhere to get drinks around the ruins.\nIt's uneven. As \u2026",
          "The palace is amazing. Beautiful place to visit and enjoy for couple of hours.",
          "Knossos is a good 6 km out of Heraklion, but you can get the Number 2 bus that's cheap and direct from the bus station near Heraklion marina.\n\nIt's far from cheap to enter or eat there, though. Take a packed lunch and water, as well as \u2026",
          "It was very interesting to see and read some of the history of the place. I enjoyed the scenery and walk through the ruins dinne we had perfect weather. I can see this would get rather hot in the summer with little shade offerings since it is a walk through time and ruins.  A very neat place to visit and learn.",
          "A fabulous place to visit",
          "If you're not that big on archeological sites there is nothing for you here. Also \u20ac15 per person is really steep. The restaurations seem to modern for the age of the site and some zones are covered by structures that I would expect to find in a supermarket parking lot. 3 stars for the peacocks.",
          "Nice but not adapted to visit with a stroller for a family. Very touristic place ... with unpleasant tourist. The restaurant inside is very nice, don\u2019t go in front of in the street !\nOtherwise, nice site to visit, story of the place very interesting",
          "Ruins of Knossos.  Great site worth a trip here. Good for 2-3 hours. Nice souvenir stores just outside.",
          "Very interesting site. Staff were friendly despite it being quite busy. Easy to get to. More information would be welcome",
          "A place that everyone should visit while on the island! The monument of history, which is impressive in its scope, I recommend non-slippery shoes when visiting!",
          "Great Place, organised",
          "Very interesting but supremely disappointing once you realise how much is painted concrete and not original at all. The interventions made seem almost criminal leaving me with very mixed feelings about this place. If the archaeological work \u2026",
          "We are aware of the historical significance of the site, but unfortunately, not much impressed by what we have seen. Maybe because we explored it on our own, without a guided tour (which costs 10\u20ac pp and there were four of us).\nWe were \u2026",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Fascinating history of the Minoans! We had an excellent guide - Karen - from our trip with Terra Santa. She was knowledgeable, and made it interesting to listen to.",
          "Knossos is Europe's oldest city, dating back over 9000 years. The ruins are rebuilt but done to an impeccable standard. The whole Palace is quite astonishing and makes for a great day out. There are walking tours available which are \u2026",
          "Very interesting historical place.",
          "Beautiful ruins, well preserved and must see for archaeological lovers\ud83e\udd70",
          "Interesting place and lots to see. Unfortunately our guide had to speak 2 different languages (not her fault of course)  which made standing around in the hot sun  even longer and more unbearable.\nI have been to bigger and better places than thab this one but still enjoyed.",
          "Pretty good looking place. If I was there alone, I'd probably see nothing but a bunch of rocks, but we had a wonderful Czech speaking guide, who told us everything there is to know about Minoan culture, so we had a great time.",
          "An amazing look into history. Highly recommend getting a guide.",
          "Very nice people and amazing site",
          "Wish there was more visuals or reading or maps of what the palace looked liked in the past. Hard to visualize what all the ruins are. Paying the amount we did to see it was not worth it, we asked for a map & they wanted us to pay extra for that too....",
          "Fascinating place, wonderful experience!",
          "An ancient structure that was destroyed by earthquakes and buried. A substantial site, unfortunately not sympathetically excavated; but still fascinating to explore.\n\nHowever, be aware that the facilities for those with mobility problems \u2026",
          "I love history and ruins, but I feel this place was a bit over price \u20ac15 for adults and free for children. But it was still interesting. We arrived at around 10 - 10.30am, the car park which is free wasn't yet full.\nThere were a lot of \u2026",

          "Mesmerising archaeological site,totally worth visiting!you can visit the archaeological museum in Heraklion within 3days with the same ticket!",
          "Very interesting place. 4000 years of history!\nStrongly recommend a private tour to understand the interest of the place.",
          "The palace is in good condition and worth seeing. It is over priced for what it is though, \u20ac15 per person and it takes less then 45 mins to explore. Despite already paying \u20ac15 the toilets are not free for women costing 50 cents, this is \u2026",
          "Crazy place full of visitors. Lines at the entrance are way to big in comparison with the site. Site was rebuild by an archeologist about 100 years ago. Most of which was performed by his own imagination without any resemblance to the past",
          "Incredible peice of history",
          "Great museum to walk around and enjoy. Lots of info boards, with information in English as well as other languages. Well worth a visit if in the area",
          "Beautiful place, very easy to find in only 5km inland from Heraklion. Avoid midday hours and bring some water with. Guided tours are available for about 10\u20ac per person.",
          "Visiting Knossos was one of the handful of times I\u2019ve been somewhere which it felt a true privilege to enter. This feeling has only become stronger in time. I have thought a great deal about this experience. It should be noted, that many \u2026",
          "Fantastic site. Well maintained with lots of information. Definitely worth getting the combined ticket and visiting the fabulous archaeological museum too (ticket is open for two days, so no rush). Parking is free, just two minutes up the road.",
          "Great place to visit while on Crete. Unfortunately most of the vivid colors are the work of restoration. If you have only a short amount of time in Crete it would be better to visit the museum.",
          "Worth having a guided tour.",
          "The cradle of modern civilization. Even though some of the walls have been rebuilt. It is a fantastic full day out .",
          "The top of them all\nExcellent",
          "We went because it felt like a must-see in Crete. It is expensive for what it is at \u20ac15 per head. There are clever guides who try to engage themselves to your service at the entrance. We decided to go around ourselves. There are standees \u2026",
          "Amazing site, a lot of information boards so useful for people who don't know much about it. Extremely busy though and hard to see certain parts. Make sure to book a few days in advance as it's cheaper.",

          "Must see for people interested in antiquity or classic culture. If academic stuff is present, they are willingly, happy to answer any question within their range of expertise. Place itself is big.\n\nIt's better for you to know where you go, otherwise you may treat it as just a pile of rubble.\n\nSpoiler: it was an earthquake",
          "Very nicely set up.  I did not mind the restoration, it helps the imagination a little.  It is restored in a way where you can still see the original structures below so not sure what all the complaints are about.  Get there early to avoid crowds.",
          "Fabulous place, not much shade the day I visited. Very busy. Take plenty of drink and food with you as prices are expensive.",
          "Unbelievable ... the architecture and water systems from 000's of years BC\nSuch advanced buildings and systems in such an age ...\nDefinately worth a visit",
          "Best ruins in the island. Some of the parts are rebuilded but this is the most iconic place and a must go site. Try to visit it early in the morning or late in the evening (18:00) because in sumer its really hot.\nThe parking is free and you have to thing that the visit will take you betwen 1 and 2 hours.",

Very amazing place and not very expensive considering it\u2019s long lasting reach on western civilization. I can\u2019t give it 5 stars though because so much of it was altered by an amateur archeologist. Still a must see location though",
          "Miniature and Powerful at the same time. Rich history and the Labyrinth stories await you here",
          "Loved it a lot but I would have loved it more if the information signs were clearer. Didn't get a good sense of how people would have lived there in the bronze age. Illustrations would help.",
          "Let's call this place \"Sir Arthur Evans Town\". Why? Well, because, a lot of what you see at this site is his reconstruction of what he \"thought\" the palace looked like -- a very biased view, and not to the satisfaction or agreement of all \u2026",
          "Huge site, masses of free parking, 3 restaurants outside opposite next to multiple tourist shops, one cafe inside, entrance was \u20ac15 adult, \u20ac8 EU senior citizen (must have proof of nationality), under 18's free. Guides available for \u20ac100 per \u2026",
          "Interesting place to visit. And I would recommend going although do get there early to avoid the queues. The partial reconstruction is done to help see how  the building would have been but as it is completed in concrete it is sometimes hard to imagine. Worth visiting either with a guide or after reading about the place.",

          "Lots and lots of tours. In July we got here at 930am. There were already 14 tour busses there. You will wait to get in. If your kid is 17, they will require an I.D. to prove it. Just say 16 years old and you're good. There will be a long \u2026",
          "If someone visits Crete he should definitely visit also Knossos. A guided tour costs almost 10 euro and I would recommend it.",
          "Even with the liberties taken by Evans, this is a phenomenal experience that is not to be missed! Be sure to drink water and wear sunscreen, as there is little-to-no shade to be found as you wander the palace ruins.\n(And don't be fooled or \u2026",
          "Full of history and myths. Very recommended to take a guide, otherwise you will see only stones..",
          "Amazing to know civilisation went that far back. 2k before Romans had baths and running water... All wiped out by a tsunami",
          "Very nice but you need a guide for actually find out everything.",
          "Not so impressed by it. Maybe it was because we didn't have a guided tour and went to explore it on our own. Without any information it's just a bunch of rocks and few columns.",
          "This is a great place to visit. Ideally go at the end of the afternoon in high season to avoid queues. We were able to walk straight in in high season in July.\nIt\u2019s an interesting site. Simple and archeological. An obvious spot to include in a Crete trip.",
          "Great trip, it takes around 45 minutes to go through all the important stuff.",
          "It's worth to visit the archaeological site of cnosso if you buy the additional ticket for the archaeological museum in Heraklio/Candia..(16euro instead of 15euro) the freshs and the objects of Cnosso's Palace are conservate there..and also \u2026",
          "Impressive place. A guide is highly recommended.",
          "Really well laid out site and placards tell most of the story of the place. Been to a number of sites over the greek islands and this felt \u201cstaged\u201d because of the rebuilt bits. Wear sturdy shoes",
          "The second most visited archaeological place in Greece after the Parthenon.\nYou will need easily +3 hours to see this huge place.\nTake some bottles of water with you in the summer period and a few snacks if you want too and enjoy the beauty of this place.\nTake some sun protection because the sun will be heavily stronger.",
          "Wouldn't recommend it, especially not with children. It's a shame they haven't got anything for children to make it fun. Even for adults it's boring, anything interactive just old explanations about Mr Evans. The impressive things are in the museum.",
          "Interesting to visit with a guided tour. Still not much fascinated from what you can see/hear, compared to the popularity of the place among tourists. Read upfront about the excavations and way it was restored.",
          "An amazing place . Very surprised at how big it was . Worth a visit",
          "It\u2019s definitely a must-see, but they could definitely upgrade the information provided... we visited the Heraklion Archeological museum the day before, so we had lots of info, but if we didn\u2019t go, we would be quite lost I think. They don\u2019t \u2026",
          "If you have time to check out only one place during your visit to Crete then this is it! ^^ An amazing piece of history!\nAlso, don't forget to apply sun lotion and bring water if you're visiting during July and August.",
          "Great piece of history. Actually several 'times' in one: the old palace from ~2K BC and the attempt of Sir Evans to restore it. Make sure to get the combo ticket for access to the restaurant in Heraklion, as that is pretty cool too.",
          "If you like Minoan history and greek mythologi this place is a must!\n\nIf you buy a combined ticket for 16\u20ac (Adult) you can visit both the Palace and Arch. Museum of Heraklion.",
          "What a waste of time. All thanks to Evans who reimagined the archeological site and reconstructed it according to his [in some cases] incorrect theories, the site went from being an A rated historical site to a B rated production of his \u2026",
          "Very crowded place, especially in Tuesday. If you go there watch your things you bring with yourself. The guardian of the palace approached my group and asked us to take care of our belongings.\nPalace is amazing place, even reconstructions \u2026",
          "Too expensive, no audioguide available.",
          "How can you comment on one of the most beautiful and ancient archaeological sites in the world? Simply stunning.",
          "Even if restored due to the archeologist vision, it's a huge area with many structures, or what remains of them. It\u2019s good to buy the collect ticket for the palace and the Heraklion museum.  It's a must see if you are in Creta and love the ancient minoic civilisation",
          "It was ok but we have expected more! Actually, may be we expected too much from 5000 years palace...the only beautiful ruins in there were restored.",
          "Everything OK.  Because of Corona, not everything could be viewed.",
          "I went to the palace of Knossos on a beautiful sunny day and had a great time.\nThe ticket for an adult only cost 8 euros and there are guides offering guided tours in several languages if you want a bit of extra information.\nThe site is \u2026",
          "Very nice daytrip ! Worth the visit !!",
          "Interesting enough, but spoiled by large tour groups blocking the walkways and paths. Guides should be doing more to ensure other visitors can get around the site without having to push through their wards.\n\nWe arrived at 8am (when it \u2026",
          "Interesting site. Much of it has been 'restored' which really means being rebuilt as it's thought it was originally, which purists might not like. We downloaded a guide to the site which tracked us and gave a relevant commentary (izi travel) which worked well.",
          "A really interesting place to know more from our history.",
          "Since you are in the area you'll probably want to check this item off your list, and you should. In reality, though, there's awfully little historical information and most if the structure are concrete reconstructions. 15\u20ac is definitely too much, but, hey, you are in Crete and you might as well.",
          "My favourite archaeoligical site in Crete! Such an amazing place with so much history. A must see when in Heraklion or nearby. I highly recommend joining a group tour there...tour guides here are very friendly and full of information about the place.",
          "breathtaking history and remarkably rescued. the stars are only for this and for the nice people owing the refreshment kiosk outside the entry serving freshly squeezed juice! however monument not well taken care of the touristic point of \u2026",
          "Really interesting, if you're in crete, you have to visit absolutely.",
          "Awesome but no greek pepole",
          "We took a guided tour, there was a lot to fit into our time at the Palace and managed to cover all of the grounds, and see the key original and rebuilt features.\nOur guide was very knowledgeable which made for an interesting trip.\nWe visited in October so no big queues to deal with.",
          "Amazing ruins of the ancient Minoan civilisation. Tours availible in many languages with extremely knowledgeable guides. Large crowds from 11AM onwards so get there early and make sure to pack water and sunscreen as the heat can be over powering. Buses availible (number 2) every 15mins or so to and from the site. Highly recomendable.",
          "The history is great. I think it does not worth to pay for guided tour, there are plenty information on the displays.",
          "Very interesting with 3d virtual screens provided by Rep gives clear vision as to what buildings used to look like",
          "An interesting place with a fascinating history. However its been partly poorly reconstructed. It should either be fully reconstructed correctly or not at all. As it is it feels like a partly excavated building site in some parts.",
          "Honestly I was so disappointed. The \"palace\" was almost completely covered in concrete and rebuilt awfully over the original ruins by the archaeologist who was leading the digg when it was discovered. Its all guesswork and I don't believe \u2026",
          "Awesome place to visit..very ok interesting",
          "Like many others before me I would advise to visit this place in the morning or in the late afternoon to avoid crowds of tourists. Sunscreen and water are you best friends when visiting this palace.",
          "First experience in crete and worst experience. Very expensive, nothing to see, lots of area are closed, the tour lasts 30min.\nKeep your money and pass your way",
          "Good historical place but quite expensive for this short tour, a lot of areas were closed, not clear explanation of the signs, not worth it 15 euro",
          "Very interesting and nice place, but a guided tour is a must to get everything out of it. Otherwise you will see just the ruins. Also, try to find time frame when it won't be so hot, as the place is open with not a many shades.",
          "Beautiful place with 5000 year old history.",
          "The largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city.",
          "As an archaeologist it is one of those dream places to go and this did not disappoint. The ruins were nice and the rebuilds have been kept in their original places. It is well priced and well presented... make sure you get a decent tour guide to get more out of it ... if in Crete this is the main place to go!!!",
          "Everyone who goes on Crete must visit this place. It is amaizing.",
          "The palace itself is a vast space of ruins.. You might find it lame at the first sight. But when you start to check the ruins closely you will find the amazing details that the Cretan people have thought of: the paintings on the walls, the \u2026",
          "Quite a lot of people and not all wear masks carefully.",
          "Definitely one of the must sees on the island. Cheap and gorgeous. Highly recommended.",
          "Very enjoyable day out and interesting history lesson.",
          "A magical place to discover Minoan culture. The prince of Lillies, the dolphins, the throne room and some other historical pictures and rooms.  Plenty of tourists, however, too many. Queues are long.  There are also lots of small stores to buy memorabilia outside.  Bring water, it is really hot in summer!",
          "Visiting the Minoan Palace is mandatory activity to be made in Creta. The Palace owns and disclosures roots of modern culture and civilization. I'd strongly suggest to book and follow a guided tour. There are several agency doing that with \u2026",
          "A must see place if you visit Crete, the remains of a Minoan palace are a vast place and you can feel its corridors resemble the appearance of the labirint. The representation could be a bit better, concrete slabs and roof covering could be done in a more subtle way, but nevertheless a piece of history that cannot be left unvisited.",
          "A well organised site that will give you an appreciation for Minoan culture, even if you're not an expert in Greek history. There were long queues for tickets in July, recommend buying online from etickets.tap.gr so you can avoid the wait. \u2026",
          "Very interesting because of the tour guide, whose name I can't remember. Quite a queue to get in, probably worth getting  tickets on line. Very hot, but our guide was great at getting us into shade with a breeze foe explanations.\nToilets only by the entrance, long queue but clean",
          "Not much to see here as most of the palace has been ruined. Taking a tour with guide would be the best option. You will get a lot more interesting information from tour guide. Facility here is a disgrace. After paying 16 euro for ticket and \u2026",
          "An amazing site covering a large area. Be prepared to spend time here as you will want to take it all in. Stand and wonder at the multi-storey buildings, the large open spaces, roads, stairs, frescoes etc.",
          "Watch Atlantis movie on Amazon prime before you visit. Amazing experience to see the ruins of Europe's first known advanced civilization.",
          "Cool to wander around and see the site. Even the recreated parts were interesting. Would have been a 5* but they posted that they closed at 6:30pm and at 6:15 they started blowing whistles to get out of the site. We rushed the last bit and \u2026",
          "An incredible place, probably best to visit with a local guide to get the best of it and skip the line. Beware, its much hotter than on the sea side (no more gentle breeze)\nWell worth a visit.",
          "Ruins of once great city, but site could be better presented to visitors.",
          "Very nice place but due to its popularity it can get very busy.",
          "A good place to go sight seeing. Its beautiful",
          "A must see. Note: nobody knows what this place was.",
          "Everything is reconstructed and you don't get the idea of how it really was. If you don't book a guided tour you will not understand what you see and how the life was during Minoan years. Also the ticket is expensive comparing of what you \u2026",
          "One of the best ancient sites you could ever visit.",
          "Historical place, if you are near Heraklion or Retimno you could definitely pay this place a visit. There is free parking on the premises, the price for standard ticket is 15 euro and you can pay extra 1 euro for the museum, and get a licensed guide for 10 euro per person.",
          "A great historialcal site that is a must to visit when in Crete. The site is magnificent in its presence and colours. Although the latest time I visited the site was slightly overcrowded the site was still a pleasure to walk around and show \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful. My second time here, and I'm still spellbound and awestruck at the sheer magnitude of the site. The restorations are a credit to the history and luxury of the palace.\n\nIf you're disabled and struggle to walk but are \u2026",
          "Greece historical place! Beautiful and amazing!",
          "Fascinating site showing the ingenuity of Europe's first civilisation, the Minoans. We toured with an official tour guide which I would recommend to get a more in depth understanding of the construction and history and significance of the \u2026",
          "A must-see place in Crete. Better come early in the morning, it gets really crowded after 11 or even earlier.\nIf you're interested in this topic, get a combined ticket. It's valid for 3 days and costs only 1euro more than a simple entrance ticket, but with it you can visit Heraklion archeological museum as well.",
          "Mystic, calm atmosphere. Nice place. Guides in several languages. Possibility to purchase a ticket to the museum together.",
          "Best have a guided tour to fully understand the site.",
          "There's not much of the real palace, it is a bit re-constructed but non the less worth visiting. Amazing feeling to imagine the history and legends behind one of  Europe's eldest civilisations!",
          "Very interesting. Great tour guide. Great stories. Great feeling somewhat enthralled being on and in the grounds were legends stood",
          "Beautiful and large! In fact, well-preserved ruins with a beautiful history and large crowds of tourists from morning till night.",
          "Go on a day with a bit of breeze to it, not much shade. Lovely views. Not for people with poor mobility. Lots of signs in Greek and English.",
          "This is a must see for any visitors Crete. It\u2019s Minoan site containing some of the oldest palaces in Europe. Most of what is visible at Knossos today, however, is Arthur Evan\u2019s modern reconstruction, and therefore not the ancient ruins \u2026",
          "Amazing experience! You could totally paint pictures with your imagination and the help of the guides of course.. Beautiful place with a mystical atmosphere.",
          "Shouldn't miss it. Just great.\nA guided tour is the best choice to better understand the place.",
          "If u know about Greek History you will love it. Wear comfortable shoes and maybe a hat if in summer time. The exhibition is very interesting and huge. You will be able to see differents rooms and parts of the Minoan Palaces and some great pics of the period.",
          "This ancient monument is truly a wonder. I was amazed how big and complex the palace was in times of its biggest glory.  On the other hand, there is really huge ammount of visitors, large groups with guide are sometines blocking the paths. \u2026",
          "The place is massive and needs at least a morning, entry ticket is pricy so you will be lucky if you come in low season since is half the price. It would be great to have an introductory room with a small documentary or similar (just ideas I did that at home but i saw it in other places as Persepolis).",
          "What can be said for this unique experience, the chance to walk in the same place where one of the most legendary ancient civilization ruled? Breathtaking.",
          "Our tour guide was exceptionally excellent explaining the history of the palace.  The excavation has provided a wealth of information about the Minoan culture.  I highly recommend this trip.",
          "Sorry but I don't get all the fuss about it.\n\nThere are only ruins left.\nIt would be way better if they left the castle as much as they could.\nThere are a lot of places you cant go to and only see it from a distance.\nThe tekstboards had \u2026",

          "The sense of history here was amazing. Very informative, impressively large and complex. The cafe next to entrance was nice.",
          "This was a fun site to visit. We reached the site by bus which wasn't difficult and was pretty inexpensive (less than three euro).\n\nWe wandered around for about an hour. It was hot but there were a number of places to sit in the shade. \u2026",
          "Great place to explore history",
          "Not much to see, entrance fee EUR 15 is overrated",
          "Extensive site worth a visit, just a short distance from Heraklion airport. Authenticity somewhat compromised by rebuilt effort to provide impression for what it would have looked like. Impressive in extent.",
          "Because of the Covid-19 and although we were only a dozen of people on the whole site, about a half of the site was closed. There was no information that it was so, and still we paid the full price. This was a very disappointing experience.",
          "Arthur Evans discovered the Knossos palace which has become an indispensible part of the charm of the island of Crete. This ancient palace is a must visit also to understand how the perception of one man and his extensive restorations can affect any archaeological site and it's interpretations.",
          "Fairly interesting to walk around. If you're in the area I would definitely go see it. If you do buy a ticket to go in, save the ticket because you can then use it to get entry into the museum in the city nearby.",
          "The place was pretty busy when we came there, but the queue didn't last long (not more than a few minutes). A lot of tourist scattered on the such a big place like Knossos is. Bring with yourself a lot of water, otherwise you will be forced \u2026",
          "Incredible site! Not much shade so be sure to bring plenty of water, and choose your tour carefully. We went with a small tour which was very informative and well done, but it was clear that most people there didn't have the same good fortune.",
          "Cool spot to visit, the site is really beautiful and the history is well preserved. You can do the visit on your own but you have the ability to ask a tour guide with one of the guide who\u2019s in front of the main entrance. Many languages available, Dutch, English, French, German... You have plenty of choice.",
          "Located on the island of Crete, this ancient capitol has a long history of human habitation. The first palace was built around 1900 BC on the ruins of previous settlements. The area includes workshops, storage areas, fresco's, irrigation \u2026",

          "Amazing place.",
          "Awesome.  I've seen this place on so many shows, just as impressive in person.  The palace and surrounding building must have spectacular in their full glory.  You can almost see the Minotaur running through the labyrinth.",

          "Highlight of the trip, really cool ruins some of which are partially restored. We'll worth the bus ride! Gift shop surprisingly terrible.",
          "This Minoan Palace of Knossos is one of its kind. I actually expected that there will be more structures but of course it was built on 1500BC. If it\u2019s scorching hot you might not enjoy this place. I\u2019m lucky because it was windy, over casted \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit, expensive entry price",
          "Wonderful spot in Crete!! The Minoan civilization city with its ruins and buildings!! A place to visit with lots of history and unique history in Heraklion!!! The most attractive one is the palace of Knosso!!",

          "The scale of this Palace needs to be seen to be believed. We took public buses from the hotel out to Knosses. Note get bus tickets from the reception desk of the hotel as its cheaper than on the bus. We need four each for the trip. Its \u2026",

          "Most of the murals have been removed and takes to the Irakleion museum which is sad as you can only see paintings that were put in their place years later. The gift shop was closed (?!) and it was high pick turist season (middle of August). Better go visit the museum in Irakleion, it is a much better experience",
          "This places is so amazing I recommend doing the museums  first just because you can see the pictures and have a better history that way you don't need a guided tour. But it was a look neat to see history",
          "Place definiately worth seeing. You can buy lovely souvenirs nearby. Students from European Union get free entrance!:)",
          "TIP 1: buy  combined ticket with the Archaeological Museum the day before and skip crowds. TIP 2: come early! Head for the main reconstructions first and catch them on the morning sun and without the relentless waves of tour groups. TIP 3: \u2026",

          "One of the oldest sites in the world - well worth visiting!",
          "Amazing place.",
          "Hang on to your hat! I visited Knossos on a windy day and the wind blew my hat down into the ruins where I could not retrieve it. The day was also very sunny and I missed the hat. I liked the reconstruction even though it was controversial, \u2026",
          "A must see for anyone travelling to Crete. Worth every penny to get in and see it. A tour guide might be helpful, but if you do your own studying then you'll be just fine.",
          "Very impressive, although much of the renovations are Arthur Evans assumptions of what areas of the palace were used for. Some are potentially incorrect. Still worth a visit as a comparison to Phaestos in the south, which is equally important and my personal favourite.",
          "I\u2019m partial to this place because I know and love \u2764\ufe0f the Minoan history. I was slightly disappointed that it had been restored so much by Evans, however, after having taken a tour with a Greek guide, she persuaded me otherwise. It may be a \u2026",
          "It's not often you see one of the oldest historical ruines on the planet. With the first people living there about 8000 years ago.\n\nBuilt up from nothing to become one of the grandest palaces I've ever encountered.\n\nPreserved and in some \u2026",
          "Ruins, not a lot of explanation available. Maybe going with a guide would be better?",
          "Considering that this is the oldest place in Europe  (first evidence goes back to year 8000 BC ) it is worth to see and discover. Plus the peacocks are a natural beauty. In about 25 minutes by bus from Heraklion you are there... surrounded by history.",
          "Neat site, costed 15\u20ac. If it wasn\u2019t for its importance, I wouldn\u2019t spend the money. Entire park took about one hour to walk around. Bring water, summers can be very hot. There is almost zero shade once you enter so dress appropriate and if you need sunscreen, apply it.",
          "Fabulous museum to discover life in King Minos' time",
          "15 euro intrance only for this.",
          "Nice place with great history I missed some shade. Not recommended in hot days. No minotaurus.",
          "If you like history, this is a place worth visiting. Although it's usually stuffed with  people here, and with alot of guides, just watching and reading about these ruins are great. Worth a visit.",
          "Interesting site. Big ruin with some reconstructed buildings. Very beautiful, worth it. Especially if you are interested in history.",
          "Fascinating look at fairly well preserved Minoan palace. An amazing insight into the ancient civilization.  Long line for bathrooms though so go before.",
          "Really interesting place. Definitely not authentic, but interesting to see the Victorian era approach to maintaining historic monuments...!",
          "Excellent historical place, need to be more organised",
          "Place where people, that even do not like archeology, are surprised.",
          "Impressive! We didn't expect much of the ruins of the Minoan palace but we were impressed when we got to the place! Located outside of Heraclion, the palace occupies huge territory and it's pretty hard to imagine how this massive palace was \u2026",
          "A great historical site to visit, though it was overcrowded, didn't bother to wait for 20 minutes for the throne room in the scorching heat.",
          "It's nice to see history older than American Presidential candidates!  Seriously, it was awe inspiring to see so much history of the human experience.",
          "Very interesting could still see the colors in the murals lots to see",
          "Best archeological site in Crete",
          "Very compact and friendly for visitors.",
          "Very interesting historic place, well kept and with lot of to see. Recomend to pay extra for a tour guide, well worthy!",
          "I have to give it 5* because it's Knossos! It's incredibly old & sophisticated & downright impressive.\nBut it is HEAVING with visitors, which makes it far harder to explore & quite unpleasant at times. I think the museum managers need to consider limiting numbers per hour & having time tickets for the most popular parts of the site.",
          "For funs of archeology. I do not recommend to go there with small children during hot day. It is difficult to find places with shadow.",
          "Great place of history. Worth a visit either in a group or on your own. 15euros entrance but you can get combined ticket with the history museum 16euros",
          "Definitely not worth it's cost. Even in a matter of fact we visit it for free, there was nothing to do there. Just a bunch of stones.",
          "This place has potential, but someone need to make an effort to make signs etcetera more interesting and graphic.",
          "Historical society that was so advanced even over 4000 years ago. Palace with 5 floors, amazing fresco, ventilation and drainage system and evolved sense of fashion and society",
          "Nice place, but I recommend visiting slightly before closing hours, palace is crowded all day long.",
          "Only half of the place was opened, but the price was the same 15\u20ac. Not worth it at all.",
          "Great place to visit if you love history. We thought there will be only 3 columns to see but the ruins take around an hour to explore and photograph. Tickets are \u20ac15 but if you wanna go to the museum it's \u20ac16. Tour guide is additional \u20ac10 per person. There are at least 2 car parks and they are free of charge.",
          "Combined with the museum, a great way to learn about Minoan civilization.   The site it self is a bit over run with tour groups.\n\nDecent, but other historic sites are far more impressive.   Visit if you are in Crete, but don't got to Crete to see the Palace.",
          "Place is ok. While I do appreciate the history of a 3000 year old Minoan palace, Evans' restorations to the site looks horrendous. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if I saw the restorations on the casino walls in Luxor in Vegas.",
          "A must! Go around 19:00, no people, no heat, parking place enough, you will have 45 min to see all, but without people is super. And your pictures even better.",
          "Very busy. Not much signage. Hard to tell what was original and what was fake. But guess you have to visit when in Crete. The archeological museum was much better",
          "Lovely place to Visit if you love to visit Historical places. Oh yes and there are beautiful peacocks on the site. If you are lucky you will see one up close or just hear them from afar.",
          "Absolute must have if you visiting Crete. I would highly recommend to take a guided tour here or read about the place beforehand.",
          "Very tall impressive old Minoan palace in Konossos, just outside Heraklion/Iraklio.",
          "Nice place to see how it might look like in the Minoan age, however there are many doubts how close to the reality it is. Ours good to see this place and Fajstos, and do some reading before coming to have more information then the short description on plates next to each more important spot.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking, well worth the drive",
          "Very nice in conjunction with a visit to the archeological museum. Otherwise a guide might help to understand the visit. Without one of the two it could be that the palace is not perceived in the right perspective. Duo tickets (Mus\u00e9um and palace) are cheap and definitely worth it",
          "Definitely go to the archiological museum first to get more information about the place. Also combined ticket is a deal you can use it in the days for purchase date. It is made more for tourists than to be historical ly correct. Go there before 8:30 to avoid huge crowds.",
          "Nice to see but not that much there overall. Very busy, and our guide wasn't much use, would be quicker and easier to walk around yourself. Most of it is in he sun.",
          "A wonderful and unique place in world history, a disappointment is that much of what you see is a 1930's recreation in concrete. Nevertheless it is well worth a visit but go later in the day gets very busy am.",
          "Great historic architecture!",
          "Superb even if Arthur Evans's reconstructions are a little odd to the modern eye...",
          "Very crowded. Buy your tickets online to avoid a long line to get in. But once you get to the site there are some passionate guides that make it a worthwhile experience.",
          "Having been to other places like Delphi, Olympia, Corinth and other places throughout Greece, I would rate this place 3 stars.\nBut if you are only visiting Crete, then it's a solid 4.\n\nFelt it was too restored.",
          "Very interesting.  Guide had good knowledge.",
          "One of the MUST SEE locations of Crete. Been there 2. time and still so amazing. This time one of Germany's big travel companies TUI provided augmented reality tablets, to follow the scenes with animations how it probably has been looking 3,500-4,500 years ago...\nEntry per adult 15 EUR, Kids before 18 free entry",
          "Some areas are not accessible, but had a very good tour by Marina, a multilingual guide with a lot of knowledge and experience on the site and culture.",
          "Interesting, but not nearly as impressive as I had hoped - you're not told what is reconstructed and what isn't, but obviously a lot is which helps give a sense of the palace. Got round in about an hour and a half and left feeling slightly underwhelmed unfortunately. Amazing that even some of it has survived however.",
          "Wonderful. Maravilloso!",
          "Much positively surprised. The palace is not so extensive so you can choose your pace and visit what is most interesting for you.",
          "Worth to be seen for the Very interesting story of the palace and about minoans and a very important piece of history as well. Three stars is related to the renovations done in the past by Evans. The massive use of concrete is something that i am struggling to forget.",
          "Amazing historical place, but I, frankly, expected more. Guide is a must or you'll end up wandering around and having no clue what's all that about",
          "The Palace of Knossos was good. There are beautiful views in every direction, and informative signs all over the place to tell you about what you're looking at. There's also a small gift shop and a cafe.\n\nI'd suggest getting there early, before the parking lot fills up with tourist buses and the palace is overrun by tour groups.",
          "Knossos might be one of the most famous sites in Crete, and possibly in the Mediterranean. As a graduated archaeologist, it was compulsory to visit the site during my visit to Crete and I enjoyed it quite a bit. However, even though there \u2026",
          "Amazing experience. Thrilled but this place. Knossos is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city. Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete.",
          "Breath-taking and peaceful place. You will feel completely immersed in history, surrounded by trees. I recommend you to book a guided tour to discover more about the complexity and uniqueness of the Minoan society.\nTips: go there in the \u2026",
          "If you love about history you will love this place. You need a sturdy pair of shoes to walk round here.",
          "Amazing experience guide was exceptionally knowledgeable",
          "We are very lucky as we have a family home only 2km from this site.\n\nThis is one of the key attractions in Crete and its proximity to the airport and port make it a must for those having a shorter stay.\n\nThese ruins have quite an \u2026",
          "The \"Place to be\", once in Creta. A piece of history, you should not miss. An interesting walk-around, you can easily spend a half-day. Guided tour or any other info back-up is highly appreciated. You can read a lot otherwise from info panels around the area.",
          "Very interesting. Reasonably priced entry - well worth it.",
          "true beauty",
          "A Crete \"must see\" . Very suitable for families who want to spend couple of hours out the hotel ....",
          "Nice and probably must visit when in Crete. The exposition is hard to read so make sure you watch the videos of the site before or after. Don't hesitate to take small kids it can be done with a stroller. Very good fruit juices at the entrance",
          "Very impressive place but be prepared to queue to get in. Under 18 and students, bring a photographic ID to get free entry.",
          "A glimpse of history. Well maintained. Must visit. Non EU students have a discounted fare of EUR 8 for a joint ticket for the palace and the Archeological museum. Please don't forget your ID cards :p",

          "Very proud we visited this magnificent palace.",
          "If ancient Greek history interests you then this is a must",

          "If you travel to Crete, must go to this place. The visit doesn't take too long. Archaeology fans would love it. Entrance is free for European Union students.",
          "Fantastic ruins of a Minoan palace!! If you like archaeology and Greek mythology, this is a great place to visit.",
          "We'll, it's Knossos, but it's also a reconstruction in plaster and colours of what the archeologists who explored it thought it COULD have been. Other Minoan ruins throughout the island are more honest. A guide can make things livelier perhaps.",
          "A great day out.  The ancient ruins are wonderfully preserved and renovated and you get a real sense of the opulence and high standards of the ancient Greeks.",
          "Fantastic site! Excellent service from the stuff!\nProud to be greek!",
          "Old.  Too restaured",
          "The temple is in very bad shape as it is very old and all there is left are old stones.\nSo old that even the landscape is not what it used to be: the temple was built next to a river that doesn't exist anymore.\nA lot of what you see has \u2026",
          "Amazing!!!",
          "Amazing site for ancient history lovers. Get here early as it gets BUSY!!! Organise a guide if you can or if not definatley get the guidebook.",
          "A must see place if you visit Crete...very well presented. As ever the Greeks grossly undercharge their visitors.... if this was anywhere in northern Europe they would be charging three times as much. A great opportunity to take some money off the rest of the EU being missed!",
          "Truly stunning piece of archeology. Would recommend acquiring the services of an authorised guide to get the most out of your visit.",
          "Knossos palace being one of the most famous and important landmarks mentioned in history books of Ancient Greece along with the it's crucial role in Greek mythology, should hold a special place in every tourist's heart that decides to visit \u2026",
          "Incredible place, not because of the ruins, but because of the history behind!\nChildren under 18 can enter free of charge, students can use a picture of the student's id and enter free. Adults 15 \u20ac.",

          "Quite an interesting to see the old palace plan in 3D :) Though most part of it was recreated in modern days.",
          "Where does Arthur Evan's dream end and the reality begin? His flights of creativity may have altered the site permanently, but at least we have this amazing foundational city that inspires just as much wonder as before it's discovery.",
          "If like history it's a great place.",
          "One of the most important European archeological sites. Definitely worth visiting. If visiting in summer, better have a hat and water.",
          "Amazing. A wonderful experience of ancient history.",
          "Amazing knossos palace, has interesting literature dotted around explaining the history. But be aware it can get very busy so go early morning. Also sometimes the layout can be a bit confusing making you way out but you work it out in the end.",
          "This is one of the oldest archaeological sites I have visited so far. The palace is amazingly well thought out and craftly build. The remains show existence of a civilisation very advanced for their times.",
          "Get the combined ticket for the palace and the archeological museum, which are valid for 3 days. My visit ~5pm on a weekday in May was fantastic for seeing a very empty palace venue, where I could read every plaque undisturbed, did not have \u2026",
          "Kinda disappointing.",

          "Highly disputable reconstructions of a fascinating site. The whole concept needs to be rethought, including on site guidance. It is a shame to reconstruct or rather reinvent the past in situ instead of next to it.",
          "It's a must when you visit Crete. It's the perfect place to know the history of the island. It's not cheap, 15\u20ac the entrance + 10\u20ac the guided tour, but its worth the visit.",
          "On a busy day it feels a bit rushed with the amount of people and guides. You'll be waiting a while in the queue if you're on your own. Unfortunately areas that used to be visitable have been closed off so not as much to see as there used to be.",
          "Nice place to visit just before midday or later in the afternoon when it's not as hot, tourist usually come around midday, free parking just before the entrance, you can buy tickets online and download them on the phone before you get \u2026",
          "Gregory was a fantastic guide. Do not go in without a guide!!!! \u20ac10 per adult on top of entrance fee of \u20ac15 per adult.  All children free for the guide and entrance fee.  Money well spent.",
          "Very interesting, worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful, historically very important site with lots of history to offer. It gets very hot so bring a hat, sunscreen and even an umbrella. There can be many queues to enter and see small rooms which may or may not be worth the wait due to \u2026",

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "We walker by this fountain and took a couple of pictures, but there isn't anything specifically remarkable about it and i wouldn't recommend spending a lot of time and effort to see it. It wasn't operable (no water) and didn't appear to be in particularly great shape.",

          "I was not that fascinated. If you're in town anyway, look at it. The venetian fortress is much more interesting and the view is beyond stunning.",

          "As much hype as there is surrounding this fountain, I didn't really understand the appeal. It wasn't working during my stay \u2013 at night or during the day. It's nice, but pictures definitely make it out to be more extraordinary than it actually is.",
          "It has been nice probably sometimes but now it\u2019s just a dry and dirty fountain in the middle of a dirty square.",
          "This is a nice foutain in the heart of the city. You will find it without searching for it. In between of the shop streets. Unfortunently, there was no water in the fountain. Maybe due to the Greek crisis?",
          "Could have been great, it's a nice fountain in a lovely square in the middle of Heraklion, a city we expected to hate but actually found quite charming. However there was no water in it, not sure why as there was no work going on or information to say why. Really disappointing",

          "I guess my expectations were too high..having seen such wonderful fountains in Italy and Spain. The structure is nice enough but without any water it doesn't really feel like a fountain. Anyway it's worth a look and you can easily find it ....but if you don't have time you",

          "Very pretty and clearly popular, judging by the numbers of tourists taking photos of it. Sadly it's not running as a fountain and just has a pool of still water at the bottom (which we spotted a cafe owner topping up with a hose pipe one morning). There are more pigeons in it",
          "A nice hang out if you just want to take a break from walking around but quite disappointing because the fountain wasn't working. Also, it's very dirty and not maintained very well. Local children taking the cents from the fountain too.",

          "Walked through the centre of Heraklion especially to see this, but we thought it was disappointing. It is quite small and unimposing. On the day of our visit, it wasn't working and looked as if it hadn't been for some time. It is surrounded by lots of noisy bars and",
          "The fountain was not 'active', so was not particularly exciting. However, it is in the centre of Heraklion where all the bars are and the busiest part of the city. A great area to people watch and enjoy the atmosphere. Most shopping streets radiate from this area.",

          "We were vey disappointed actually by the fountain since it was not a fountain! It is nice to leisurely stroll over here but I am not sure it was worth the special trip we made to see it. I understand that symbolism and significance but again I am not sue it is worth a special",

          "I have given this 4 \"stars\" because I have visited this fountain in 2003 and it was working and beautiful. Now, Heraklion is filled with scammers trying to get tourists money. The fountain was off and the little water that was in it was disgusting and dirty. It's a shame",
          "We just walked by, didn't even know this was a famous sight. There was a few annoying little Chaplins who wanted people to take photos of them and when we didn't want to take any photos they were acting unkindly and rude against our small girl. It's not the fountains fault, but",

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "Visited here as a group of 9 with friends and children. On entrance staff were rude and not very open to the childrens enthusiasm to learn and understand the cretan culture. Staff were abrupt and not open to questions, children were expected to walk around with their hands by",
          "The museum is well presented, and covers a huge historical range, giving a good overview of Cretan history. We found that it probably tries to cover too much, and that parts, such as the Second World War section, left us wanting more.",
          "You get a nicely arranged presentation of the history of Crete, which differs from the rest of Greece. All texts are also in English.",
          "Fantastic museum. It preserves the artistic, historical and natural artifacts and exhibits them to the public. You can see from the demonstrations and exhibits the different historical phase of local history throughout the centuries. From the Venetian era to modern times and the",
          "Worthwhile visiting this Museum its not as busy as the Archeogical museum of Crete but still has lots of really ancient artifacts. There is a very small coffee shoo on the upper tier but not a very good selection of snacks. 5 euro each and you can spend an hour or two learning",

          "My teenage son and i spent about an hour in this museum-\u20ac5 admission for me and free for him. We were especially interested in the permanent exhibition exploring and effectively describing Crete\u2019s role in WW2. The museum is very close to the Venetian fort and bus station down",
          "One of the best museums I have ever visited. It may be small but what you see is amazing. Everything is well displayed with too many exhibits in cases that you can see all sides. It does worth the visit.",

          "We spent a couple of hours learning something of Crete\u2019s history. The exhibits were well set out in modern surroundings within reasonable walking distance of the port. There is small entrance charge, but a visit is recommended.",
          "This museum is excellent. The history of Crete is so well explained and interesting. The large models of the city are fascinating and the whole display and collection is so well put together. I have been several times to see it and brought others also. It is also near the nice",
          "This museum shows you what the island of Crete has gone through in the past 600 years or so. Numerous countries have ruled over it and through those times blood has been shed. There are religious paintings, pottery ,coins, weapons and a section on the Crete way of life, all to",
          "Worth the time. The museum takes you from BC right through to post WWII. Set out in chronological order so helps put all the ancient timelines into perspective. Very well set out and the very good interpretation signage.",
          "The historical museum is easy to miss but inside there are some intetesting exhibits. The best is definitely the world war 2 exhibit. Very informative. Probably took an hour to see and there are quite a few steps. There was also a sculpture exhibit on when I visited which was",

          "An excellent introduction to the history of Crete from the end of the Romans to end of World War 2. Well labelled in Greek and English, spread over 4 floors. The section on World War 2 was particularly interesting, and there is a beautiful collection of Byzantine sculpture. The",
          "Entry was 5 euros which was just right for the hour or so it took to walk around. The museum has lots of very interesting exhibits, our favourite was the exhibit on the second world war. We were quite suprised how much was squeezed into small space. I think this museum is well",
          "We only had time for one museum and decided on this one rather than the archaeological museum as it covered more of the islands history. There is plenty to see and learn here, from ancient times to WWII and Crete's interesting political history. A bit dry so may not be ideal for",
          "A \u20ac5 entry to this museum was just about right for just over an hour it took to walk around. I liked the way that it was laid out in chronological order and allowed you to appreciate how life and history has changed on Crete over the last 2000 years. For me the modern history",
          "Again, a really interesting place to visit to learn more about Cretans and their way of life, from ancient times to the current day. There is also a fascinating section on how they coped during WWII and a good exhibition on Nikolas Kanzantzakis",
          "The history of Crete spans the millennia starting from Minoan prehistoric times to which the Archaeological Museum is devoted. But what happened in Crete later? This museum offers a panorama of Cretan history from circa 330 (early Byzantium) to the WWII Battle of Crete. It",
          "This was worth the 10min walk from the main bus station, along the sea front. 5 euro entrance fee, there are toilets near reception and free lockers to leave bags in. Staff were very friendly. Its well laid out over several floors with clean displays in both English & Greek.",
          "A small but very well curated and interesting museum that takes you through the history of Crete from historical times up through the 20th century and WWII. There was just the right amount of information so you are never overwhelmed. A great little museum that everyone with any",
          "I suspect most tourists think of this as 'the other' museum in Iraklion, but this little gem has beautiful icons, a fantastic exhibit on the city as Venetian Candia, as well as art and coats of arms and een a room dedicated to the island's role in the Greek War of Independence.",
          "An extremely interesting mueum which manages to pack a lot into a small place and it's really worth visiting for an overview of Cretan history. Particularly poignant is the story of Cretan suffering under the constant invasions and its assimilation of these invaders although",
          "The Museum presents a variety of historical topics: classical (of course), but also continues the timeline of Crete with displays about the Venetian Heraklion (great model), Byzantine influence and folk customs. Of particular interest was the exhibit on Crete during World War",
          "We visited this Museum today and spent 2 hours going round. It contained everything including historical and cultural, from traditions to a thought provoking section on World War II. The staff were wonderful and helpful, access was good and toilet facilities spotless. Wheelchair",
          "The World War 2 floor detailing the German invasion and occupation was particularly interesting. The museum is well laid out and arranged. The model of the ancient city on the ground floor is well done. Free for children 12 and under. It's good value.",
          "This is worth to visit place, because you will get quite easily information about the history of Crete. The museum is planned well: in the first room are different eras of the history, later more detailed information. The challenge of the island has been to be situated between",

          "Very good museum. Very beautiful Greek National costumes and historical items. Large Knossos model, interesting coins. Very enjoyable!",
          "Quite a modern museum, compared to others in Crete. Tasteful presentation of objects. It's a large museum, but they don't go on and on with half a million different pot shards like some other museums we've visited. They show you their top pieces and move on to the next bit, so",
          "Spent a very enjoyable morning in this very well laid out museum. I felt I learned a lot about the history of Crete, and found some of the exhibits very poignant. Also loved the El Grecos, which I was not expecting! Highly recommended.",
          "Not a large Museum, so you can take your time. Good overview of the later periods of Crete, up to the Second World War. Some fine exhibits, and I particularly enjoyed the account of the kidnap of the German General by the British, with the help of the Cretan Resistance.",
          "This museum gives a good overview of Cretan history, but has some flaws. The museum is modern, and many of the displays are quite interesting. Sometimes, however, events are poorly explained. For example, there are repeated references to a \"holocaust\" at the Arkadi monastery,",

          "This museum is all about Crete's often turbulent history from BC to post WW2. Laid out over 4 floors with unique e exhibitions. Really enjoyed the relu2gious icons set against low lighting and black back drops. 5\u20ac to get in and well worth it. Cafe on 1st floor v nice esp",
          "From the 4th century AD onward to World War II, this museum picks up where Heraklion's archaeological museum stops. It has a wealth of artifacts and exhibits, most with well-written information, also in English. I was especially impressed with the exhibits on the third floor,",

          "A modern museum full of interesting artefacts and information about Crete. From early days through to the awful occupation during WWII and up to date. There is a wonderful collection of religious icons, worth a look if only for the artistry, along with a collection of modern art",
          "We visited Heraklion for the day, my 11 year old daughter is mad for history. I was surprised when she asked to look around the museum, but I'm glad she did. Some of the artefacts that are on display from centuries ago is amazing. All the displays have explanations in Greek and",

          "The museum is located near Heraklion town center. It's kind of hidden. In fact, we almost walked past it. However, at 5 euros I have stepped into the past and learned everything about the history of Crete. Literally, I mean everything. From the history, to the island's culture,",
          "After you visit here, then walk over to the castle. It relates closely to the maps and information you see at this museum. The museum also has temporary exhibits.",

          "This museum is only a 5 minute walk from Heraklion's 'main drag' but I found it quite poorly sign-posted. Entry is \u20ac5pp and includes a guide leaflet in your own language. The museum is deceptively large and is light & airy. It takes you on a journey from Crete's early",

          "The entry price was only \u20ac5 so I decided to give it a shot. It was like a standard European museum. If you want to learn more about the history of Crete it worth the visit, if you are not that bothered just go to the archaeological museum.",

          "This museum tells the history of Crete, from ancient times through World War II. Fortunately, since the other sites in town cover the ancient history well (Palace of Knossos and Heraklion Archaeological Museum), the focus here is more on the A.D. period: Roman, Arab, Byzantine,",
          "A quick look was all we had time - and legs - for so I won't say much, except that I'll come back and do it justice next time. There's more than one floor and it's stuffed with interesting info and exhbits, particularly about more recent history. Can you do it in a day along",
          "It is my second time in the museum. Very good and rich expositions. Liked a lot the Venetian era expositions. The WW2 exposition is very interesting and exciting. The folklore exposition is lovely and inspiring. Recommended.",
          "As a museum professional, I can really recommend this museum to all visitors, it is really interestingly laid out, good labelling and wonderful artefacts.",
          "Very interesting museum.You can see how the town of Heraklion was during the previous centuries.You see things about the battle of Crete and Nikos Kazantzakis.",
          "It is one of those visits that make you feel like traveling is indeed worth it. The Historical Museum of Crete is a fine building that houses Cretan history since the Byzantine times. The setting of its collections is what is special about it, constrasting history and tradition",
          "Mixed quality of description notes, generally well set out artefacts. Audio guides of poor quality generally, with less information than the written descriptions, Very good exhibition on Crete and World War II and very good folklore exhibits. The Portolakis exhibition of icons",
          "This is a very interesting museum that covers the history of Crete all the way up to WW2. What is different about this museum is that many artefacts are not kept inside glass cabinets but out so you can literally touch some of them, many of the artefacts that are not kept behind",
          "This deals mainly with history rather than Archaeology and goes tight up to 2nd World War. Ran out of time as we had to catch our flight!",
          "Was very interesting and educational to see and hear all about Creete history. Learned a lot about the previous eras.",
          "This place mainly tells the political story of the last 500 years or so of Crete. Most people probably wouldn't be that terribly interested. It does cover the German invasion and the founding of Greece and describes the Turkish involvement. Very good for what it is.",
          "Somewhat tardis like mush bigger on the inside, I expected archaeological focus but it is very varied. Met a guide who explained to my son how to use the traditional knives of Crete, my son (a black belt) enjoyed the demonstration. Would recommend",
          "This privately endowed Museum in Herakleon is a housed in a former private residence with a later modern extension. It follows the history of Crete from prehistoric times through the Venetian occupation and latterly the traumatic second World War. At the time of my visit",
          "This museum features Byzantine art, information on the many rebellions in Crete, the history of Crete itself and Its prized paintings by El Greco. It took me just under 2 hours to go through and it is well laid out and easy to follow Crete through the ages.",
          "a great museum for the history of Heraklion and Crete. It is impressive to see the plenthy of civilizations that passed from Crete. Maybe not the most impressive miseum but realy great if you spent the nesesary time and take the audio guided tour.",
          "I particularly wanted to look at the El Greco painting of St Catherine's monastery and the WW2 display. These thoroughly lived up to my expectations and the rest of the museum was excellent definitely worth a visit.",
          "The museum is housed in a lovely old building along the renovated waterfront and can easily be combined with a walk along the port, which is a must do. I found the exhibits of the various occupations interesting, as well as the replica of Nikos Kazantzakis' study and collection",
          "Very interesting information on the many occupations of Crete. Only thing we struggled with was the English translated information was in a dark gold/brown on a black background, so difficult to read. The Greek was white on black, would be better if both could be the same.",
          "The original goal of those founding the Historical Museum of Crete or Historical Museum in Heraklion was to collect and preserve valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical material deriving from the medieval and modern periods in Cretan history. The same approach also",
          "We spent a lovely morning at this museum. Check out the upper floor to see a reproduction of a home, as well as cooking items and clothing. The WWII exhibit was also fascinating.",
          "different sort of exhibits than the archeology museum but also well worth a visit and a wander through to see more of the actual life of the ages gone by.",
          "Interesting display on the history of Crete through the ages. Lots of information and well displayed. 2 small paintings by El Greco on display. Lots of icons, Byzantine art, local folk costumes. Easy to spend nearly 2 hours there.",
          "Some museums really can, to many people, be dry and hard going - that is never the situation at Heraklion. The exhibits are well presented, the explanations are well written and your interest will be held from start to the finish of your visit",
          "You find this along the seafront not far from the Natural History museum. It deals with the city history and not the Minoan/Roman past at the archeological museum. Has regular special exhibitions. Small but good shop",
          "This interactive museum is a must visit. I usually got bored with museums after 60 minutes or so but here we spent over two hours getting an education about Cretan history. The compact building set over four floors and was interesting on every level. A visit not to be missed.",
          "This museum was tacked on to the end of our tour of the palace at Knossos. We were happy with the experience at the Knossos site, but this museum, freshly renovated now, really allowed the palace, the history and culture of Crete to all come alive and remain in our memories",
          "A very modern museum in an old building on the waterfront of Heraklion. Small fee to enter. Very interesting exhibits, many interactive. Gives good chronological history of the people of Crete from ancient times to the turmoil of World War II.",
          "It was in our plan visiting this museum during the hot hours of the day. Completing our morning schedule, we went to the Historical Museum of Crete. It is hundred meters from Heraklion Fortress.In front of the Museum you can enjoy a see view were you can have a nice time after",
          "Took about an hour and a half in the museum. Good overview of the history of Crete, especially the world war 2 part. Only 5 euro to enter.",
          "I didn't expect much from this museum. However, this is an excellent museum encompassing Crete's history from early times through World War II. The displays are excellent, many of them using small video presentations. We spent well over an hour there. Well worth your time, for a",
          "I am not really a museum person but we really enjoyed this one. Allow yourself an hour and a half to enjoy this... the people that work here are really knowledgable and happy to answer all your questions.",
          "I loved this museum! it is one of the best museums i have ever seen! The museum has a lot of rooms, each room containing a different collection. At the entrance you get a map which guides you to visit every room so you can learn Cretes history in a logival order. There are a",
          "We enjoyed this museum very much, as it did a great of explaining the history of Crete (and in English!). Some of the murals and artifacts are really beautiful.",
          "The collection is in each room different, and therefore constantly interesting. The restaurant had possibilities for sitting inside or outside. To sit in the sun or in the shadow. I had a marvelous view on the sea, Heraklion Port. The food was excellent!",
          "So well laid out, it is like walking through a time portal. Incredible amount of artifacts to see and learn about. We \"popped in\" for a look and spent a couple of hours here.",
          "It was the best of all the museums we visited. The self-guided tour was very explanatory. Only point i would like to add is that sometimes we need to look to find the numbers to put on the device.",
          "I went both to the archaeological and the historical museum and I must say this one was more fun. While not as impressive, it hosted a more diverse collection and we managed to get a better story through the audio guides (which the archaeological museum lacked). Crete's history",
          "Nice museum about Crete history in some floors. Crete history insight from Minoan times from World war 2. No dislikes.",
          "A wonderfull place to see exhibits for cretan and ancient greek history, interesting artifacts from minoan period. A look to civilization and culture of cretans and greek. If you visit this museum during the summer you should check the amazing night events on the back yard of",
          "Nice little museum, and relatively accessible for the disabled (elevator to second floor level 2A, but there are still a few stairs to climb to level 2B). Great ground floor display, however, although in Greek and English the English is faint and rather hard for my older eyes to",
          "I like wrap up, the summary of the history of this incredible island. That complete well the visit of the archeological museum.",
          "I believe the original History Museum was located opposite this but is currently under renovation - (There are ruins that have bridges over them). The museum itself doesn't look like one, so you may miss it and there's some sections which are still under renovation. Adults are",
          "Stunning exhibits well presented definitely somewhere to spend a couple of hours to get a break from the heat. Helpful staff, nice cafe and shop.",
          "Really interesting, well assembled and displayed collection. An absolute must if you are in Crete, everything you would expect to see is here and some unusual surprises. Everything is labelled in English and an English audio guide is available.",
          "Impressive time about the history and the past times. Gave me a good feeling what has happened during the last several thousands of years. Descriptions in Greek and English . Even when there were hundreds of visitors I never felt stressed or disturbed by any noise . Good times",
          "We visited the museum after visiting Knossos. The museum is very well laid out with excellent exhibitions and is well worth a visit. There are also information about each of the cabinets etc in English as well and our guide from Knossos accompanied us and explained displays in",
          "Another great museum in Heraklion just a short walk from the natural history museum. This was little more adult than the natural history museum but just enough to keep the kids interested. A very interesting history of the island from early times through to the occupation and",
          "Can miss this museum if you don't have the time. Rather visit the Heraklion Archaeological museum and spend more time there. The El Greco paintings were nothing great. Other than that nothing of significance.",
          "I have to admit I was expecting dusty displays .... I was very surprised by the interactive exhibition introducing history of Crete. Pity there was not more detailed intro of the history after ww2. I recommend to borrow the audio guide which has more details and the period music",
          "a lovely place.Friendly staff.Very clean and tidy place.Very interesting for people who read History.",
          "Very close to the center small museum showing history of the area, what I found unexpectedly a good collection of hand guns, some of them made in USA which I\u2019ve never seen before in any museum I\u2019ve visited",
          "A lovely well laid out museum filled with a variety on interesting items. The staff are very helpful. This is a museum where you are allowed to photograph the exhibits. Not to be missed when visiting Heraklion, just a short walk along the coast road from the bus station and port.",
          "Surprisingly good collection of stuff on several floors. very reasonable at five euros and easy to find.",
          "Very educational place. When i readed reviews, i noticed that lot of ratings and feedback wasn't actually from this museum. Suomeksi viel\u00e4 Ihmiset kun ei n\u00e4k\u00f6j\u00e4\u00e4n erota arvosteluissaan argeologista ja historiallista museota toisistaan... Historiallisessa museossa on p\u00e4\u00e4asissa",
          "I figured that if I was in the island of Crete, I could probably benefit from learning something about it. I had low expectations of a small museum with a bunch of pots, or old trinkets in glass cases. Boy, did this museum exceed my expectations! Perhaps because we also rented",
          "We spent a couple of hours in the museum which covered the history of Crete and its various conquerors through to the second world war. Walking round also gave us a couple hours respite from the sun and we finished our visit with a coffee served under the trees in the garden",
          "Excellent small museum in an attractive building with friendly staff. Easy to get around, displays well presented .",
          "Good exhibits. Lovely and cool inside. And there is a wooden model of Knossos which helps make some sense of its form. Easy to get to from bus station 1.",
          "Goodness. Where to begin. This place is such a veritable feast that it requires more than one visit, From the plethora of sculptures to the quaint exhibits from Cretan villages, the museum delights the eyes. My absolute favourites were the pieces of Byzantine art, some of which",
          "Liked the El Grecos, the exhibition about Kazanztakis (author of Zorba the Greek), and the stories fromn WW2. Not a single mention of the Greek Colonels and their reign of terror though.",
          "The antedote to all the Cretan 'tourist' history that concentrates on Minoan Crete to the exclusion of all the rest. Gives a great insight into the complex history of Crete, one not to be missed. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "It is an excellent idea to have a detailed museum of non-minoan history of Crete, and this museum has great collection of artifacts, however it fails to present them properly. The main problem is that the audioguide is extremely basic, and is very close to just reading the label",
          "From the knossos palace to the museum passing by all the sight seeing hot spots you will have a nice time and do not forget to taste the most famous local sweet the (boughatza) you will like it...",
          "This lovely, little museum offers 2 El Grecos (native Cretan), history of Crete, library and films of author, Nikos Kazantzakis (Zorba the Greek, Last Tempation of Christ, among many others), art of Crete and a very interesting history of Crete in each of the World Wars--the",
          "We love history museums and had high hopes for this one, which is a private collection. Some of the displays were interesting (e.g. WWI period) but the museum was scattered over several different floors and rooms and we believe the price was high for the content displayed. We",
          "This museum has history going back a 1,000 years. Laid out over 4 floors, it starts with the first recorded history of the Island and continues up until World War 2. It was well laid out with all of the information in English. This museum does not appear to have a large number",
          "This museum is operated by a private foundation and is better managed than state funded institutions. Well presented and informative displays and a couple of early El Grecos.",
          "This Museum covers a long history dating back to the Byzantine, Medieval, going through the Ottoman, 19th Century and WWII Eras. Touring the Museum makes you feel as living in each of these Eras through Pottery and Miniature Sculptures, Photos, Paintings and Icons, Books and",
          "Very interesting history of Crete with various artefacts. To be visited. Unfortunatley, the two El Greco's paintings weren't visible due to work in progress.",
          "This is a much smaller museum compared to the Archaeological Museum of Crete. It had some interesting artifacts, but not as exciting as the stuff in the Archaeological museum. If I could only go to one museum on Crete, it would be the Archaeological Museum.",
          "Great museum - very well curated with beautiful displays and ample information in English. A must-see when you visit Crete!",
          "after 10 days in Greece/Crete, it's nice to get the basics about history of Crete. This museum does it nicely, clearly presented and quite complete. It does not take long to visit though, don't expect too much (yet you can find the 2 remaining El Greco painting)",
          "Great experience. Especially suitable for those interested in Greek history up to Second World War. But not really a place were children would be interested.",
          "For only 5 Euro, this museum is good value. There is a fair bit to see covering both ancient and modern history and there was enough English descriptions to understand the displays. The service was great. The gentleman at the entrance counter was very helpful and spent some",
          "Crete has been invaded so many times! The museum covers in great detail the struggle of this island for its independence and the sacrifices of it people.",
          "The museum is full of Greece history, lots of information from the past. We went with our two daughters which cost only 10\u20ac. It wasn't really much for the youngest however still a must see if you love Crete.",
          "This is an interesting museum, that highlights the history of Crete in the C.E.(common era or the antiquated term A.D.). The WW II was an eye-opener for me, as I did not know the history of that time for Crete. It is well worth a visit to learn about Crete.",
          "This beautiful small museum on four levels is well worth the visit: you will follow the history of Crete from ancient to modern times, realising that due to its locations, various \"invaders\" consequently added a unique richness to this island. A couple of paintings by El Greco &",
          "I did know what to expect, especially because Imthought all museums were \"historical\", but I enjoyed my visit very much. I think the diversity of exhibits and the tremendous span of time covered from ancient history to modern times made this museum special and quite",
          "This small, private museum has two early works of \"El Greco\", who grew up in Heraklion. Their exhibit on World War II is particularly interesting. They tell their story quite differently than British accounts.",
          "if you want to know what else has been happening in Crete after the Minoan civilization, than this is the museum for you. it is near the Venetian city wall, so it is easy to find.",
          "The exhibits of this museum date back to the Byzantine and medieval periods. On display there are also relics from the Cretan revolutions and a collection of Cretan folklore items. I found it interesting enough and worth visiting if you want to go deeper in the Cretan culture.",
          "The best stuff in this museum is futhest upstairs. Worth seeing the folk costumes and the stuff about WW2. Ground floor a bit dull.",
          "Today i had chance to visit there. At the beggining there is a huge 3-d map of Heraklion, which i find very good.than the things come chronilogicly you can easily understand the simple history of Crete if you spend 45 minutes in there. At the end i reccomend you to drink coffee",
          "I like to go to museums about local history. This museum is about AD forward. While it does provide a view of history from a cretan point of view it is not as good as other local history museums I have seen.",
          "I liked best the information about Crete during the occupation during the 2nd World War and the part played by the British especially Patrick Leigh Fermoy. The historical exhibits are interesting but not as good as the Archeological Museum. There are two small El Grecos on",
          "It is interesting museum.Presenting history of Crete.The frescos on the second floor are disapointing.On the upper floor are folklor dresses.",
          "I cannot say enough good things about this museum. I spent about three hours wandering leisurely through its halls on a slow January morning where I was the only patron for the majority of my time. For connecting the long history of political changes on Crete, the first room on",
          "The museum has a good collection of exhibits illustrating the history of the island. Photography is allowed.",
          "This museum has many interesting displays and art works from the Byzantine time to the 20th century. The latter is a display about World War II. Unfortunately more attention is given to graves of Nazi soldiers than the Jews that they deported to their deaths. In the earlier",
          "I find that it is sometimes difficult, as a foreigner, to get a grasp on the post-classical history of Greece, because so many of the museums and featured sites are ancient. The Historical Museum of Crete is a good way to acquaint yourself with some of the history that you don't",
          "Was a great idea to visit the historical museum. Was a great experience. I really like to go again. Was amazing. We went there with my friends and we make many photos. Was great time.",
          "Spent an afternoon their and learned so much about Cretan history, its links to Venetian history and historical ownership are fascinating, it was 10 euros to get in and over 4 floors, if you have any interest in Cretan history, you\u2019ll love this place.",
          "In a building that used to be the house of Kalokerinos, a great benefactor of Heraklion the modern building attached to the classic building shows the effort to meet our history through our modern eyes. Visitors can have a look at our history and, i believe is a \"must to visit\"",
          "The museum itself is not big, but very very informative. It covers the whole history of the island and we learned a lot from the trip. Great way to learn more about this beautiful place. Very helpful staff!",
          "I had a very interesting visit in this Museum. If you have 2 hours free go there! It gives you all the history of Crete. Hope you will enjoy it as i did.",
          "We spent some 3 hours in here, absorbing so much about ancient Crete - most of which I did not know. The displays are wonderful, the explanations so good; however, someone ought to change some of the print in English - beige text on a black background with low lighting, so bad",
          "Clean, tidy and well laid out. Covers Cretan history comprehensively - ancient but also through to Byzantine era, Venetian, Turkish; War of Independence; and through to WW2. Also houses the Nikos Kazantzakis collection.",
          "Enjoyed to see the place. Everything was very well organized and easy to find, not too much. The historic rewiew of El Greco was interesting and made me want to know more about this person. And the outside garden wit a cup of coffee to relax was also good. Here you can sit down",
          "Would recommend to anybody who is in heraklion to pop in. Great collection of artifacts ! They have minoan, classic greecian and some roman pieces.",
          "Despite the Folk Art on the second floor which was charming, this is a dull museum. It has a pleasant cafe' looking out to sea, where you can rest your legs!!",
          "This is really small museum, situated on the sea side just next to st.Peters church. It has hot 4 floors full of historical artifacts. On the the best piece of history - a collection of ancient statues and tops of columns. At the top floor are two small rooms with 20th century",
          "If you have interest for Crete\u00b4s history: Go to the historical museum in Heraklion. It's a little museum, but you get a good experience of Crete's history",
          "A very nice and well-organised museum for the rich history of Crete after the ancient period, covering byzantine period, middle ages to WWII. For the ancient period see the archaeological museum.",
          "I am not a museum bug cause the museums usually doesn't follow the demands, slow and missing concepts. However this one is really interesting, we have visited this one with my wife after the archeological museum and I can tell we didn't feel tired at all, only at the end when we",
          "They close at 17:00 we came there at 16:30 and they asked us to . leave we examined as much as we could but it wasn't enough",
          "Beautifully set out. Easy to follow the lay out unlike some museums where you go round in circles. Unfortunately it shut at 5pm and we had not quite seen it all.",
          "A lot to see, from pre historic to modern day. Three floors with a nice cafe for a mid way break. Audio guides are adequate but not super informative. Good signage in English.",
          "From ancient to modern Crete. There were exhibits on El Greco and Nikos Kazantzakis. The audio tour is a bit enjoying as you have to enter the number every time.",
          "This was my second visit and I will definitely go again. After spending more than 3 hours it was impossible to take in more but there are still things I need to spend longer studying. The special exhibition of El Greco was very tastefully done and a friend who has been to a top",
          "Very much focused on telling the story of Crete, right up until modern times. It seemed relatively impartial and didn't seem to have any political agenda.",
          "Great museum , that must be visited to understand the history and the culture of Crete which is a mixture of several influences from the Minoan civilisation to the Ottomans do not miss the last floor if you are interested in getting acquainted to the traditional life in Crete",
          "Always, when my foreign friends are visiting, I'm providing a tour toward the museums. Worthy to visit. Something different, and in a very nice plaza to spend later on your time for a coffee or a snack or lunch.",
          "As a numismatist, I particularly liked the impressive display of Cretan coinage through the ages. I also enjoyed looking at the furniture and equipment to be found in old Cretan houses.",
          "You will see many interesting topics and all will excite you! You must visit this Museum! You will know a lot more about Crete!",
          "This is El-Greco Year so the museum staged an exhibition around two original paintings by Dominikos Theotokopoulos, a.k.a. El Greco recently acquired by the Municipality of Heraclion. The show focuses on the Venetian and Roman magnates who supported Theotokopoulos in his early",
          "Full of history without being cluttered or overwhelming. A tad crowded with tour groups but able to move through without feeling pressured.",
          "This museum is not as spectacular as the archeological museum, but still very much worth the visit, if you have some time to spare. Museum is very well laid out, has a nice atmosphere and includes archeological remains and history of Crete from the 4th century AD up to and",
          "I suggest to visit the museum with a guide , the museum is nice but if nobody explain you something you just walk around and loo at the things,The museum has a cafeteria too we eat there the food was ok.",
          "Well laid out and labelled items, well lit. air conditioned building. museum staff very well informed and helpful.",
          "Not as spectacular as the archeological museum, but does tell the rest of the story of The varied history of Crete. Very interesting.",
          "Staying on a beautiful island like Crete, one should make an effort to learn about the local history and culture. The historical museum gives this, and more. Recommended.",
          "I wish we had a guide to explain everything. It gets very tiresome to read a lot of little plaques. Although, I did learn a great deal! The museum has a great atmosphere and connects the past and present very well.",
          "During our travel to Heraklion two weeks ago, we visited several museums. One of them is the Historical Museum of Crete. The museum presents a collection of valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical materials depicting the history of Crete from early Christian period",
          "It covers quiet several periods of Cretan life and you leave with the sense that you learnt few things for the locals in the present and the past.",
          "Modern Crete (post-renaissance) with an emphasis on El Greco and Kazantzakis. A very well presented collection with section on folk traditions and WW2.",
          "I went here with a tour group after visiting Knossos. It was great to see the artifacts found there and learning more about Minoans. I really enjoyed the frescos, jewelry, and tombs. I am told the museum is recently renovated and it is really beautiful. It is also very English",
          "Great museum with fascinating and well thought out displays. It makes a great first stop when you visit Heraklion as there is a lot of information about the local architecture and structures which you can see when you\u2019re walking around the town. It doesn\u2019t look very big from the",
          "If travelling to Heraklion in the heat you need to plan your visits to museums carefully, so I suggest to start from west going east and start first with the Natural History Museum then the Historical museum of Crete located some 5min walk from the first one and having the",
          "Just full of interesting objects and works of ancient art and history. A must see. We were fortunate to visit on National Environment day and thus the usual 6 Euros entrance fee was waived. It puts into perspective what wonderful art there was at Knossos and elsewhere on the",
          "We had travelled through Turkey and Greece, looking at all sorts of ruins and museums, but this museum was probably the best of them all! If you have the time (maybe 2 hours?), then absolutely go and visit.",
          "The museum is a quick and thorough introduction with photos, icons, jewelry, weavings, models and videos of the history of this much fought over island. For new visitors to Iraklio there is a large table top model of how the city looked a hundred years or so ago that is perfect",
          "Medium-sized museum over 3 floors, but packed with information, so that I ended up spending 3 hours here. There are ancient artifacts, mosaics, clothing, jewellary, paintings, coins... Well labelled in English. Don't miss the section on WW2, but don't watch the videos if you are",
          "If you want to find out the unique historical and cultural richness of the island, this is the perfect place to start and travel from the most ancient times to modern history. The artifacts are very well preserved, some of them also being a real joy for the eyes, such as the",
          "Wow, that\u00b4s all. There is just so much to see on original exhibits. Idealy a guide would make this a real experiance as there are many storeys behind each item and some very important exhibits could be missed.",
          "A museum that hosts a variety of items and themes from 400 till the liberation of Crete. very interesting and well curated in a perfect spot in Heraklion just by the waterfront",
          "This is a very well done museum that spans the fascinating history of Crete, from ancient times to the present. Well presented, with good interpretation of exhibits.",
          "Intelligently laid out. In many ways better than the touted but hollow archaeological museum. Don't miss Kazantzakis's study or the lovely and short essay on time in the folk exhibit on the top floor.",

          "This museum is very well equipped if you wanna learn more about Cretan history since the middle age, it doesn't offer enough information about ancient history (and neither does Archeological Museum, by the way). Anyway, overall is an excellent place to get to know more about",
          "This museum is very well equipped and it shows a lot of history of the Crete. Few years ago it was free entrance,now it is 5 euros. And everyone who loves history and want to learn something new must visit this museum.",
          "This museum is housed in a former villa and is beautifully laid out, something the Greeks are very good at. It traces the history of Crete both at a national and a local level and is a must if you want to know more about the development of the island.",
          "5 euros is the cost of getting in, and it was worth every cent. We spent a couple of hours and learnt so much about the history of Crete, it was fascinating. Could have spent at least another hour if we had it to spare. The exhibits are extremely well displayed, with",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours learning more about the history of the island. Helpful staff and well presented exhibits with information in both Greek and English Cost in Nov 2013 was just 5 euro Spent just over 2 hours looking rounf 3 floors but you could easily spend",
          "It had a great variety of information and articles on view, from the room that Kazantzakis worked in (He wrote The Last Temptation of Christ and Zorba the Greek) He was great writer and a brilliant thinker. I especially enjoyed his book \" The Saviours of God\" They also",
          "I ended up spending more time here than intended. It has numerous interesting displays covering the most of the period humans have occupied Crete. pros: displays organized by historical periods. Excellent Audio Guide providing hefty chunks of information for each display",
          "The museum has a wealth of information about Crete and more particularly some very interesting background information and places to visit in Heraklion. Very well presented.",
          "E5 entrance fee. In a beautiful restored mansion on the left of the seafront road, 10 minute walk west of Venetian Harbour - extremely interesting and informative with excellent displays relating to many different periods of Heraklion's history and the changes brought about by",
          "Lovely icons, interesting WWII exhibit, a superb relief of Iraklio over the centuries. The garden cafe is charming and there are a few books and gifts to buy. It is nicely located a short walk from the Natural History Museum and across the street from Mare, a wonderful",
          "This museum has so much to offer and takes you thru the history of Crete. Very well done, weary interesting. You can take a break while here and sit out on the terrace, enjoy a Greek coffee and look at the beautiful water.",
          "If you want to learn about the culture in Crete and its development, this is the place to go. It provides information regarding history, archaeology, tradition and much more. The place is easy to find, located along the shoreline of Heraklion.",
          "We could not find where to turn the flash off in both cameras and each time we thought we had it sorted, we'd click away and the flash was still there. We were still at the entrance and not even into the museum and one of the ladies kept saying \"no flash, no flash\". We should",
          "Having already been to the hugely disappointing Natural History Museum, we didn't hold out very high hopes for this place, especially as it was housed in what at first glance appeared to be a small municipal building; were we ever wrong! The museum itself is very well thought",
          "so much of interest could spend a good hour or so there,curators on hand to tell you anything you wanted to know.didnt mind you taking photo,s, entrance fee very good considering all that was in there,all in all one of the best museums in crete from personal experience.",
          "We ended up going to this museum after we had to abort our plans, due to transportation \"issues\", to visit a sight on the south side of the island. We went frustrated and were pleasantly surprised at how well this museum is laid out and presented. It does not get the fan fare",
          "This museum is a bit of a walk from the centre but such a little gem when you get there. The floors follow the timeline of Cretan/Greek history, ending with an amazing insight into Crete's part in the second world war. On the top floor are lovely displays of Cretan folk",
          "I recommend visiting this museum early in your vacation because it teaches you a lot of things about Crete's history and gives you an good understanding of what you see around you. It also gives you a great perspective of the place and helps you appreciate its beauty even more.",
          "If you have gone and seen Knossos go and see this as it has the real wall painting and other things found at the site!! takes about and hour to see but worth the time to add to experience",
          "We wanted to find out more about the German occupation and this was just the place to do it. Well laid out. If you want to go further back, then you can because it covers so much.",
          "Only one part of the museum was available. The statues were closed. The cost was four euros and am not sure if this included the fact that you only got to visit the first floor of the museum only. We visited Knossos Palace prior to visiting the museum in the same afternoon. It",
          "I learnt that the history of Crete is even more complex than I thought it was. I gained a little insight into the proud, indomitable character of the people. May the island now enjoy peace and harmony. Much integration has gone on, as well as war and tyranny, it seems. I did",
          "Whilst on Crete, I made the decision to visit the Crete Historical Museum and I must say.....I do believe that it is well worth the time and money to make the visit. The museum is very easy to find and is just a stones through away from the harbour. Once inside the museum, the",
          "A sporadic collection of exhibits showing all facets of Crete and its history. Downstairs a little dull - start there Upstairs much more interesting and relevant If going to the archeology museum as well, buy the joing site discount ticket. Well worth doing both.",
          "Historic City map in relief helped orient one to future exploration; the folk objects reminded us of the Benaki in Athens, just smaller and as interesting.",
          "It's not a big museum, but that's not a big problem. Sometimes in the really big ones the exhibits overwhelm you. Here you get a nice picture of the history of Crete up to now. I especially liked the ground floor, where you had the old Heraklion. I read a lot of the writings",
          "Beautiful collection of artefacts in a modern air conditioned building which can be a relief from the weather whilst soothing the soul.",
          "This is one of the best small museums I have visited in a while with everything laid out well, sensible organization and very informative. If you are a Zorba the Greek fan then visit to see the 'reconstructed' library of the author, there are a couple of El Greco's for overs of",
          "First visited here in February 2004 and the museum was struggling with limited displays. Now this building of four floors with sea views has the most marvelous exhibits. The history of Crete is explained in relation to the strategic importance of the island and covers the last",
          "I was very impressed at how thorough the exhibits were without being overwhelming. I hated history in high school so I was clueless as to the past of the island. Therefore, I took my time reading through each blurb in the first room and it was a great background for what was in",
          "Beautifully set up, comprehensive but not overwhelming. Excellent explanations in English. Have a coffee in the small cafeteria with a great view to the sea.",
          "This museum was a late addition to our itinerary and we were glad we visited. It provided an excellent overview of the history of Crete and the culture of the Cretan people. There are good exhibits of artifacts, artwork, and sculpture from around Crete, and a nice display of",
          "Really enjoyed this museum and its coverage of Crete's rich history and of the local items on display. I particularly liked the section of Crete's favourite son, Nikos Kazantzakis, recreating his study and displaying some of his works, including art. The WWII section also",
          "I really liked this museum. The first floor is a bit dry, but there is a whole section about Crete's involvement in WW2 which is really interesting (I\"m not a history buff). The top floor has a nice section about Cretan life. It only took about one hour.",
          "Excellent museum that covers all the history of Cretes , not to be missed .Cretes has a history with the Roman Empire , The Ottoman Empire and an active role during the world war II, in addition to contributions by writers,movie Directors and thinkers. The collection of Photos",
          "This museum was excellent. It wasn't very crowded so i am not sure many know about this museum. It has wonderful exhibits and all the history of Crete. Not to be confused with the archeological museum, this Historical Museum deals with the most recent history of Crete. Don't",
          "I asked a Police about the direction and he directed me towards the Natural museum. But I found my way. They show the history from the 2:nd until the 20:th century and including a special room about the 2:nd world war and about how Crete become to be an part of Greece. They",
          "A definite stop off! very informative with a interactive model of the city in the past and a optional audio tour for 3 euros.great artifacts and information on more modern history like world war two. great if you like history and art! Free EU student entry also!",
          "I like very much the room with the themes of Battle of Crete and El Greco and Byzantine paintings. Also the Museum has a room dedicated to Kazantzakis, very interesting.",
          "There are the usual items relating to local history, including a very nice table display of how the city looked in the 1600s with relevant photos showing how the ancient buildings looked later and some, now. A large room explains the atrocious behavior of German troops during",
          "Lots of great historical information and amazing up front and not-even-plexiglassed or roped off artifacts from a thousand years ago. Only thing that knocked this down a star was the overzealous docent who quite literally followed us wherever we went. It was ... unnerving.",
          "We took the \"hop on, hop off\" bus around the island, and this was one of the stops. It does not look like much of a museum from the outside, but looks can be deceiving! It looks like just a store front or gift shop from the street, but there is a lot to see when you are",
          "During our cruise on board the Queen Mary 2, we were scheduled to visit Athens but bad weather forced the ship to divert to Crete where we spent a day in Heraklion. For a port city, it was quaint and busy (probably caused by the influx of 1,000 cruise passengers for the day!).",
          "If you have a couple of hours to spare then you must visit this lovely museum, right on the waterfront and adjacent to a small square with some excellent fish restaurants. The highlight for me was the history of the Island; you can fill in knowledge gained from the Archeological",
          "The wharf was amazing. The architecture of the city was beautiful, the locals were so friendly, and the weather was fantastic! What can I say? There is nothing as lovely as the Meditteranean",
          "This is a must if you are Heraklion - or anywhere in the world! We were 'picked up' by the Director because I was interested in the Battle of Crete and I have never been shown such kindness and interest - particularly ironic as the Brits pulled out of Crete at the crucial moment",
          "Excellent way to get an idea of the island's history from pre-Roman times through Turkish control and very interesting WWII. Several floors....allow 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
          "I really appreciate the setting and exhibits, the chronomogical display and the variety of exhibits. It seems to be a professional setting with expertise.",
          "Lots of interesting exhibitis, but it was made much more informative with a licensed guide to explain what you are seeing and how it relates to Cretan history. The section on World War 2 in Crete was very good, and compensated for the fact that the Museum devoted to this topic",
          "The Historical Museum of Crete is not to be confused with the Archaeological museum that has been under renovation for several years now close to the main square in central Heraklion. This museum is a 5 minute walk along the port road from the old Venetian harbour. Walking in",
          "Quite a few of the reviews in this section appear to be describing the Heraklion Archaeological Museum and not the Historical Museum. Ignore any that refer to the Minoans, or 3,000 years of history; this museum deals with more recent times. It's a good museum.",
          "My girlfriend and I went there in the evening, before dinner (19 - 21). It is really a place worth visiting. The exposition is overall fantastic (even if we couldn't see from life the Del Greco's paintings because they were both temporary lended to other museums) and it is not",
          "The main attraction of this museum is the wonderful jewellery dating from 3000BC and the frescos from the Minoan Palaces on the island of Crete. After that unless you are seriously interested in pottery take a quick look and get out to visit the actual archeological sites.",
          "Only place to see relics from Knossos. A must stop if you visit the historical site first. Incredible things to see from the Ancient Minoans. Only part of the museum is open now, but a must see exhibit.",
          "We have enjoyed the visit, not long, interesting and representative choice of exhibits. The children also enjoyed.",
          "We thought the display was very good and full of interest to travellers in Crete .The building seems newly renovated",
          "This museum is small enough not to tire and big enough not to bore. A truly fascinating story presented more or less in a nutshell. Well illustrated with exhibits as well as enough text for the more inquisitive. Do visit this museum if you are interested in the history of this",
          "An interesting visit with plenty of good information about the island of Crete. The best thing was that there was a Starbucks very close!",
          "Well structured and not boring as it covers the rich history of crete after the romans and the greeks.",
          "a very interesting museum full of history and lots to see and wonder around, loads of items that have been dug up and preserved",
          "This museum is a must see if you want to understand something of the (rather tumultuous) history of Crete, from prehistoric times to now. It is very nicely set up, there are lots of explanations (in Greek and in English) and some of the artifacts are stunning: pottery and",
          "I spent one week on Crete island. There are 4 towns in this beautiful island. you need a car to get around .Heraklion is a highlight one with historical site ,mueum and aquarium. I stay at Rethymno which is in the middle. enjoy food although expensive !! tip choose a",
          "Everybody who visit Crete must see this excellent Museum and visit Knossos. To visit Crete and not see The Prince with Lilies is like a holiday without sea and sun. Enjoy Crete and Cretan wine!",
          "Is not a big museum therefore you will spend only around 1 hours. Is very well organized with a lot of information in English language. You will see the history of Crete island starting from ancient time, arab - venetian - ottoman period, their independence period and the union",
          "I liked very much .It is interesting and rather different than some other museum in the area .Have in mind that it is quite small.",
          "As the Archaeological Museum was under renovation, this was a lovely museum to explore giving some interesting background of the island and the city.",
          "Though not very in depth, the museum gives a great look at the history of Iraklion and the island of Crete: pictures, ancient weapons, archaeological finds, documents, etc. The museum has a great modern fill to it, with iPads and touch screens and so on. Between the exhibits you",
          "You can see the history of Crete,not only the Minoan civilisation.Interesting exposition.Very pleasant to go",
          "Igor to see... but this museum didn't offer much! Stuff total selfish and very personally orientated. In many question they was not able give answers. A young man who try give some orientations showed clearly the nationalistic feelings. A young lady in a level of guide museum",
          "The historical events are still in hearts of Cretans. It's good to find out why. The WW2 part is really incredible. I did not know that the Germans (Nazis) have killed over 40% of the Cretan population.",
          "This was a wonderful museum, nearly as spectacular as the Iraklion Archaeological Museum, neither of which I would advise missing! The Historical Museum of Crete hosts a wide range of attractions from beautiful Byzantine art, to two small El Greco paintings; a history of Crete,",
          "Well presented, well organized small museum that will give visitors a very good idea of the richness of Heraklion's past. The small upstairs section on daily life presents an interesting selection of objects and costumes. The maquette of the city clearly explains its history.",
          "I loved the section on Byzantine art and artefacts, particularly the icons. Fantastic and moving display about the battle for Crete during WW2. Learnt a lot about Cretan culture and heritage from the 'folk' section too. A great museum.",
          "This is a lovely museum which is a good size - not too big or small- the main collections are superb and there is always a changing exhibit. Eveything is well laid out and there is even a small cafe if you need a break. Staff are helpful and low key so your visit is relaxing.",
          "Very well sorted historical museum. Great monuments and historical pieces. Nice travel to the past.",
          "Anyone with any knowledge of Greek history would be aware that it is tumultuous to say the least. This is excellent and tries to give any visitor an insight into the history and different periods of Crete. The items on display are accessible and easily understandable.",
          "Interesting for World War II although not a lot about Australians and the part they played in the war",
          "For collectors and people who know and can appreciate quality.This is one of the finest small museums full with substance and very fine and rare quality artifacts which cover the full Cretan-Greek History From the Minoans the Byzantines , Venetians .Extremely rare and difficult",
          "Short, sweet and very informative. A story board for the history of Crete and one whole room for WW II history. Great for teens with short attention spans.",
          "This place takes a little finding, but is well worth the effort. It's so easy to think only of Knossos and the Minoans here on Crete, but there is a great deal more to the history than this - Venetians, Ottoman Empire and Germans to name but three. Go - you'll not be",
          "This is another beautifully laid out museum which gives a real insight into the life and history of the area. It massively enriched our stay. And even here, the cretan welcome was lovely. We were made to feel like honoured guests, and when it sadly came to closing time, we",
          "This museum is easy to overlook as it does not get the fame and recognition of the Archeological Museum, which is a shame since it is a fantastic little museum covering the history and artifacts of the city history especially focusing on the byzantine and following eras.",
          "We'd read about this museum in the guide books and we were all really looked forward to visiting this place. However when me, my wife and 2 children (aged 4 & 8) arrived, my boys were met with dirty looks from man sitting in reception. We paid our entrance fee and walked around",
          "Situated on the sea front about 10 minutes walk from the harbour wall this museum was an unexpected treat. The exhibits are all very carefully labelled in Greek and English. The museum is divided into a number of rooms dedicated to different aspects of Greek culture as well as",
          "loved the items wide range of statues, gold, weapons and art and all well detailed in the wall plaques the staff were warm friendly and very helpfull but not much parking around",
          "One of the best museums I have ever visited. Only small but what you get to see is terrific, some of the gold items are quite exquisite. Considering the age of many of the items on show, they are so well preserved and with workmanship that I would not have believed possible.",
          "Historical museum of Crete was a pleasant surprise for me. It represent history of Crete from Byzantian times to 2. World war. Visitor start's its visit in rooms in ground floor where are displayed model of Heraklion city and maps of Crete island. In next two floors you can see",

According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "My teenage son and i spent about an hour in this museum-\u20ac5 admission for me and free for him. We were especially interested in the permanent exhibition exploring and effectively describing Crete\u2019s role in WW2. The museum is very close to the Venetian fort and bus station down",
          "One of the best museums I have ever visited. It may be small but what you see is amazing. Everything is well displayed with too many exhibits in cases that you can see all sides. It does worth the visit.",

          "This museum shows you what the island of Crete has gone through in the past 600 years or so. Numerous countries have ruled over it and through those times blood has been shed. There are religious paintings, pottery ,coins, weapons and a section on the Crete way of life, all to",

          "We only had time for one museum and decided on this one rather than the archaeological museum as it covered more of the islands history. There is plenty to see and learn here, from ancient times to WWII and Crete's interesting political history. A bit dry so may not be ideal for",
          "A \u20ac5 entry to this museum was just about right for just over an hour it took to walk around. I liked the way that it was laid out in chronological order and allowed you to appreciate how life and history has changed on Crete over the last 2000 years. For me the modern history",
          "Again, a really interesting place to visit to learn more about Cretans and their way of life, from ancient times to the current day. There is also a fascinating section on how they coped during WWII and a good exhibition on Nikolas Kanzantzakis",
          "The history of Crete spans the millennia starting from Minoan prehistoric times to which the Archaeological Museum is devoted. But what happened in Crete later? This museum offers a panorama of Cretan history from circa 330 (early Byzantium) to the WWII Battle of Crete. It",

          "I suspect most tourists think of this as 'the other' museum in Iraklion, but this little gem has beautiful icons, a fantastic exhibit on the city as Venetian Candia, as well as art and coats of arms and een a room dedicated to the island's role in the Greek War of Independence.",
          "An extremely interesting mueum which manages to pack a lot into a small place and it's really worth visiting for an overview of Cretan history. Particularly poignant is the story of Cretan suffering under the constant invasions and its assimilation of these invaders although",
          "The Museum presents a variety of historical topics: classical (of course), but also continues the timeline of Crete with displays about the Venetian Heraklion (great model), Byzantine influence and folk customs. Of particular interest was the exhibit on Crete during World War",
          "We visited this Museum today and spent 2 hours going round. It contained everything including historical and cultural, from traditions to a thought provoking section on World War II. The staff were wonderful and helpful, access was good and toilet facilities spotless. Wheelchair",
          "The World War 2 floor detailing the German invasion and occupation was particularly interesting. The museum is well laid out and arranged. The model of the ancient city on the ground floor is well done. Free for children 12 and under. It's good value.",
          "This is worth to visit place, because you will get quite easily information about the history of Crete. The museum is planned well: in the first room are different eras of the history, later more detailed information. The challenge of the island has been to be situated between",

          "Quite a modern museum, compared to others in Crete. Tasteful presentation of objects. It's a large museum, but they don't go on and on with half a million different pot shards like some other museums we've visited. They show you their top pieces and move on to the next bit, so",
          "Spent a very enjoyable morning in this very well laid out museum. I felt I learned a lot about the history of Crete, and found some of the exhibits very poignant. Also loved the El Grecos, which I was not expecting! Highly recommended.",
          "Not a large Museum, so you can take your time. Good overview of the later periods of Crete, up to the Second World War. Some fine exhibits, and I particularly enjoyed the account of the kidnap of the German General by the British, with the help of the Cretan Resistance.",
          "This museum gives a good overview of Cretan history, but has some flaws. The museum is modern, and many of the displays are quite interesting. Sometimes, however, events are poorly explained. For example, there are repeated references to a \"holocaust\" at the Arkadi monastery,",

          "A quick look was all we had time - and legs - for so I won't say much, except that I'll come back and do it justice next time. There's more than one floor and it's stuffed with interesting info and exhbits, particularly about more recent history. Can you do it in a day along",
          "It is my second time in the museum. Very good and rich expositions. Liked a lot the Venetian era expositions. The WW2 exposition is very interesting and exciting. The folklore exposition is lovely and inspiring. Recommended.",
          "As a museum professional, I can really recommend this museum to all visitors, it is really interestingly laid out, good labelling and wonderful artefacts.",
          "Very interesting museum.You can see how the town of Heraklion was during the previous centuries.You see things about the battle of Crete and Nikos Kazantzakis.",
          "It is one of those visits that make you feel like traveling is indeed worth it. The Historical Museum of Crete is a fine building that houses Cretan history since the Byzantine times. The setting of its collections is what is special about it, constrasting history and tradition",
          "Mixed quality of description notes, generally well set out artefacts. Audio guides of poor quality generally, with less information than the written descriptions, Very good exhibition on Crete and World War II and very good folklore exhibits. The Portolakis exhibition of icons",
          "This is a very interesting museum that covers the history of Crete all the way up to WW2. What is different about this museum is that many artefacts are not kept inside glass cabinets but out so you can literally touch some of them, many of the artefacts that are not kept behind",
          "This deals mainly with history rather than Archaeology and goes tight up to 2nd World War. Ran out of time as we had to catch our flight!",
          "Was very interesting and educational to see and hear all about Creete history. Learned a lot about the previous eras.",
          "This place mainly tells the political story of the last 500 years or so of Crete. Most people probably wouldn't be that terribly interested. It does cover the German invasion and the founding of Greece and describes the Turkish involvement. Very good for what it is.",
          "Somewhat tardis like mush bigger on the inside, I expected archaeological focus but it is very varied. Met a guide who explained to my son how to use the traditional knives of Crete, my son (a black belt) enjoyed the demonstration. Would recommend",
          "This privately endowed Museum in Herakleon is a housed in a former private residence with a later modern extension. It follows the history of Crete from prehistoric times through the Venetian occupation and latterly the traumatic second World War. At the time of my visit",
          "This museum features Byzantine art, information on the many rebellions in Crete, the history of Crete itself and Its prized paintings by El Greco. It took me just under 2 hours to go through and it is well laid out and easy to follow Crete through the ages.",
          "a great museum for the history of Heraklion and Crete. It is impressive to see the plenthy of civilizations that passed from Crete. Maybe not the most impressive miseum but realy great if you spent the nesesary time and take the audio guided tour.",
          "I particularly wanted to look at the El Greco painting of St Catherine's monastery and the WW2 display. These thoroughly lived up to my expectations and the rest of the museum was excellent definitely worth a visit.",
          "The museum is housed in a lovely old building along the renovated waterfront and can easily be combined with a walk along the port, which is a must do. I found the exhibits of the various occupations interesting, as well as the replica of Nikos Kazantzakis' study and collection",
          "Very interesting information on the many occupations of Crete. Only thing we struggled with was the English translated information was in a dark gold/brown on a black background, so difficult to read. The Greek was white on black, would be better if both could be the same.",
          "The original goal of those founding the Historical Museum of Crete or Historical Museum in Heraklion was to collect and preserve valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical material deriving from the medieval and modern periods in Cretan history. The same approach also",
          "We spent a lovely morning at this museum. Check out the upper floor to see a reproduction of a home, as well as cooking items and clothing. The WWII exhibit was also fascinating.",
          "different sort of exhibits than the archeology museum but also well worth a visit and a wander through to see more of the actual life of the ages gone by.",
          "Interesting display on the history of Crete through the ages. Lots of information and well displayed. 2 small paintings by El Greco on display. Lots of icons, Byzantine art, local folk costumes. Easy to spend nearly 2 hours there.",
          "Some museums really can, to many people, be dry and hard going - that is never the situation at Heraklion. The exhibits are well presented, the explanations are well written and your interest will be held from start to the finish of your visit",
          "You find this along the seafront not far from the Natural History museum. It deals with the city history and not the Minoan/Roman past at the archeological museum. Has regular special exhibitions. Small but good shop",
          "This interactive museum is a must visit. I usually got bored with museums after 60 minutes or so but here we spent over two hours getting an education about Cretan history. The compact building set over four floors and was interesting on every level. A visit not to be missed.",
          "This museum was tacked on to the end of our tour of the palace at Knossos. We were happy with the experience at the Knossos site, but this museum, freshly renovated now, really allowed the palace, the history and culture of Crete to all come alive and remain in our memories",
          "A very modern museum in an old building on the waterfront of Heraklion. Small fee to enter. Very interesting exhibits, many interactive. Gives good chronological history of the people of Crete from ancient times to the turmoil of World War II.",
          "It was in our plan visiting this museum during the hot hours of the day. Completing our morning schedule, we went to the Historical Museum of Crete. It is hundred meters from Heraklion Fortress.In front of the Museum you can enjoy a see view were you can have a nice time after",
          "Took about an hour and a half in the museum. Good overview of the history of Crete, especially the world war 2 part. Only 5 euro to enter.",
          "I didn't expect much from this museum. However, this is an excellent museum encompassing Crete's history from early times through World War II. The displays are excellent, many of them using small video presentations. We spent well over an hour there. Well worth your time, for a",
          "I am not really a museum person but we really enjoyed this one. Allow yourself an hour and a half to enjoy this... the people that work here are really knowledgable and happy to answer all your questions.",
          "I loved this museum! it is one of the best museums i have ever seen! The museum has a lot of rooms, each room containing a different collection. At the entrance you get a map which guides you to visit every room so you can learn Cretes history in a logival order. There are a",
          "We enjoyed this museum very much, as it did a great of explaining the history of Crete (and in English!). Some of the murals and artifacts are really beautiful.",
          "The collection is in each room different, and therefore constantly interesting. The restaurant had possibilities for sitting inside or outside. To sit in the sun or in the shadow. I had a marvelous view on the sea, Heraklion Port. The food was excellent!",
          "So well laid out, it is like walking through a time portal. Incredible amount of artifacts to see and learn about. We \"popped in\" for a look and spent a couple of hours here.",
          "It was the best of all the museums we visited. The self-guided tour was very explanatory. Only point i would like to add is that sometimes we need to look to find the numbers to put on the device.",
          "I went both to the archaeological and the historical museum and I must say this one was more fun. While not as impressive, it hosted a more diverse collection and we managed to get a better story through the audio guides (which the archaeological museum lacked). Crete's history",
          "Nice museum about Crete history in some floors. Crete history insight from Minoan times from World war 2. No dislikes.",
          "A wonderfull place to see exhibits for cretan and ancient greek history, interesting artifacts from minoan period. A look to civilization and culture of cretans and greek. If you visit this museum during the summer you should check the amazing night events on the back yard of",
          "Nice little museum, and relatively accessible for the disabled (elevator to second floor level 2A, but there are still a few stairs to climb to level 2B). Great ground floor display, however, although in Greek and English the English is faint and rather hard for my older eyes to",
          "I like wrap up, the summary of the history of this incredible island. That complete well the visit of the archeological museum.",
          "I believe the original History Museum was located opposite this but is currently under renovation - (There are ruins that have bridges over them). The museum itself doesn't look like one, so you may miss it and there's some sections which are still under renovation. Adults are",
          "Stunning exhibits well presented definitely somewhere to spend a couple of hours to get a break from the heat. Helpful staff, nice cafe and shop.",
          "Really interesting, well assembled and displayed collection. An absolute must if you are in Crete, everything you would expect to see is here and some unusual surprises. Everything is labelled in English and an English audio guide is available.",
          "Impressive time about the history and the past times. Gave me a good feeling what has happened during the last several thousands of years. Descriptions in Greek and English . Even when there were hundreds of visitors I never felt stressed or disturbed by any noise . Good times",
          "We visited the museum after visiting Knossos. The museum is very well laid out with excellent exhibitions and is well worth a visit. There are also information about each of the cabinets etc in English as well and our guide from Knossos accompanied us and explained displays in",
          "Another great museum in Heraklion just a short walk from the natural history museum. This was little more adult than the natural history museum but just enough to keep the kids interested. A very interesting history of the island from early times through to the occupation and",
          "Can miss this museum if you don't have the time. Rather visit the Heraklion Archaeological museum and spend more time there. The El Greco paintings were nothing great. Other than that nothing of significance.",
          "I have to admit I was expecting dusty displays .... I was very surprised by the interactive exhibition introducing history of Crete. Pity there was not more detailed intro of the history after ww2. I recommend to borrow the audio guide which has more details and the period music",
          "a lovely place.Friendly staff.Very clean and tidy place.Very interesting for people who read History.",
          "Very close to the center small museum showing history of the area, what I found unexpectedly a good collection of hand guns, some of them made in USA which I\u2019ve never seen before in any museum I\u2019ve visited",
          "A lovely well laid out museum filled with a variety on interesting items. The staff are very helpful. This is a museum where you are allowed to photograph the exhibits. Not to be missed when visiting Heraklion, just a short walk along the coast road from the bus station and port.",
          "Surprisingly good collection of stuff on several floors. very reasonable at five euros and easy to find.",
          "Very educational place. When i readed reviews, i noticed that lot of ratings and feedback wasn't actually from this museum. Suomeksi viel\u00e4 Ihmiset kun ei n\u00e4k\u00f6j\u00e4\u00e4n erota arvosteluissaan argeologista ja historiallista museota toisistaan... Historiallisessa museossa on p\u00e4\u00e4asissa",
          "I figured that if I was in the island of Crete, I could probably benefit from learning something about it. I had low expectations of a small museum with a bunch of pots, or old trinkets in glass cases. Boy, did this museum exceed my expectations! Perhaps because we also rented",
          "We spent a couple of hours in the museum which covered the history of Crete and its various conquerors through to the second world war. Walking round also gave us a couple hours respite from the sun and we finished our visit with a coffee served under the trees in the garden",
          "Excellent small museum in an attractive building with friendly staff. Easy to get around, displays well presented .",
          "Good exhibits. Lovely and cool inside. And there is a wooden model of Knossos which helps make some sense of its form. Easy to get to from bus station 1.",
          "Goodness. Where to begin. This place is such a veritable feast that it requires more than one visit, From the plethora of sculptures to the quaint exhibits from Cretan villages, the museum delights the eyes. My absolute favourites were the pieces of Byzantine art, some of which",
          "Liked the El Grecos, the exhibition about Kazanztakis (author of Zorba the Greek), and the stories fromn WW2. Not a single mention of the Greek Colonels and their reign of terror though.",
          "The antedote to all the Cretan 'tourist' history that concentrates on Minoan Crete to the exclusion of all the rest. Gives a great insight into the complex history of Crete, one not to be missed. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "It is an excellent idea to have a detailed museum of non-minoan history of Crete, and this museum has great collection of artifacts, however it fails to present them properly. The main problem is that the audioguide is extremely basic, and is very close to just reading the label",
          "From the knossos palace to the museum passing by all the sight seeing hot spots you will have a nice time and do not forget to taste the most famous local sweet the (boughatza) you will like it...",
          "This lovely, little museum offers 2 El Grecos (native Cretan), history of Crete, library and films of author, Nikos Kazantzakis (Zorba the Greek, Last Tempation of Christ, among many others), art of Crete and a very interesting history of Crete in each of the World Wars--the",
          "We love history museums and had high hopes for this one, which is a private collection. Some of the displays were interesting (e.g. WWI period) but the museum was scattered over several different floors and rooms and we believe the price was high for the content displayed. We",
          "This museum has history going back a 1,000 years. Laid out over 4 floors, it starts with the first recorded history of the Island and continues up until World War 2. It was well laid out with all of the information in English. This museum does not appear to have a large number",
          "This museum is operated by a private foundation and is better managed than state funded institutions. Well presented and informative displays and a couple of early El Grecos.",
          "This Museum covers a long history dating back to the Byzantine, Medieval, going through the Ottoman, 19th Century and WWII Eras. Touring the Museum makes you feel as living in each of these Eras through Pottery and Miniature Sculptures, Photos, Paintings and Icons, Books and",
          "Very interesting history of Crete with various artefacts. To be visited. Unfortunatley, the two El Greco's paintings weren't visible due to work in progress.",
          "This is a much smaller museum compared to the Archaeological Museum of Crete. It had some interesting artifacts, but not as exciting as the stuff in the Archaeological museum. If I could only go to one museum on Crete, it would be the Archaeological Museum.",
          "Great museum - very well curated with beautiful displays and ample information in English. A must-see when you visit Crete!",
          "after 10 days in Greece/Crete, it's nice to get the basics about history of Crete. This museum does it nicely, clearly presented and quite complete. It does not take long to visit though, don't expect too much (yet you can find the 2 remaining El Greco painting)",
          "Great experience. Especially suitable for those interested in Greek history up to Second World War. But not really a place were children would be interested.",
          "For only 5 Euro, this museum is good value. There is a fair bit to see covering both ancient and modern history and there was enough English descriptions to understand the displays. The service was great. The gentleman at the entrance counter was very helpful and spent some",
          "Crete has been invaded so many times! The museum covers in great detail the struggle of this island for its independence and the sacrifices of it people.",
          "The museum is full of Greece history, lots of information from the past. We went with our two daughters which cost only 10\u20ac. It wasn't really much for the youngest however still a must see if you love Crete.",
          "This is an interesting museum, that highlights the history of Crete in the C.E.(common era or the antiquated term A.D.). The WW II was an eye-opener for me, as I did not know the history of that time for Crete. It is well worth a visit to learn about Crete.",
          "This beautiful small museum on four levels is well worth the visit: you will follow the history of Crete from ancient to modern times, realising that due to its locations, various \"invaders\" consequently added a unique richness to this island. A couple of paintings by El Greco &",
          "I did know what to expect, especially because Imthought all museums were \"historical\", but I enjoyed my visit very much. I think the diversity of exhibits and the tremendous span of time covered from ancient history to modern times made this museum special and quite",
          "This small, private museum has two early works of \"El Greco\", who grew up in Heraklion. Their exhibit on World War II is particularly interesting. They tell their story quite differently than British accounts.",
          "if you want to know what else has been happening in Crete after the Minoan civilization, than this is the museum for you. it is near the Venetian city wall, so it is easy to find.",
          "The exhibits of this museum date back to the Byzantine and medieval periods. On display there are also relics from the Cretan revolutions and a collection of Cretan folklore items. I found it interesting enough and worth visiting if you want to go deeper in the Cretan culture.",
          "The best stuff in this museum is futhest upstairs. Worth seeing the folk costumes and the stuff about WW2. Ground floor a bit dull.",
          "Today i had chance to visit there. At the beggining there is a huge 3-d map of Heraklion, which i find very good.than the things come chronilogicly you can easily understand the simple history of Crete if you spend 45 minutes in there. At the end i reccomend you to drink coffee",
          "I like to go to museums about local history. This museum is about AD forward. While it does provide a view of history from a cretan point of view it is not as good as other local history museums I have seen.",
          "I liked best the information about Crete during the occupation during the 2nd World War and the part played by the British especially Patrick Leigh Fermoy. The historical exhibits are interesting but not as good as the Archeological Museum. There are two small El Grecos on",
          "It is interesting museum.Presenting history of Crete.The frescos on the second floor are disapointing.On the upper floor are folklor dresses.",
          "I cannot say enough good things about this museum. I spent about three hours wandering leisurely through its halls on a slow January morning where I was the only patron for the majority of my time. For connecting the long history of political changes on Crete, the first room on",
          "The museum has a good collection of exhibits illustrating the history of the island. Photography is allowed.",
          "This museum has many interesting displays and art works from the Byzantine time to the 20th century. The latter is a display about World War II. Unfortunately more attention is given to graves of Nazi soldiers than the Jews that they deported to their deaths. In the earlier",
          "I find that it is sometimes difficult, as a foreigner, to get a grasp on the post-classical history of Greece, because so many of the museums and featured sites are ancient. The Historical Museum of Crete is a good way to acquaint yourself with some of the history that you don't",
          "Was a great idea to visit the historical museum. Was a great experience. I really like to go again. Was amazing. We went there with my friends and we make many photos. Was great time.",
          "Spent an afternoon their and learned so much about Cretan history, its links to Venetian history and historical ownership are fascinating, it was 10 euros to get in and over 4 floors, if you have any interest in Cretan history, you\u2019ll love this place.",
          "In a building that used to be the house of Kalokerinos, a great benefactor of Heraklion the modern building attached to the classic building shows the effort to meet our history through our modern eyes. Visitors can have a look at our history and, i believe is a \"must to visit\"",
          "The museum itself is not big, but very very informative. It covers the whole history of the island and we learned a lot from the trip. Great way to learn more about this beautiful place. Very helpful staff!",
          "I had a very interesting visit in this Museum. If you have 2 hours free go there! It gives you all the history of Crete. Hope you will enjoy it as i did.",
          "We spent some 3 hours in here, absorbing so much about ancient Crete - most of which I did not know. The displays are wonderful, the explanations so good; however, someone ought to change some of the print in English - beige text on a black background with low lighting, so bad",
          "Clean, tidy and well laid out. Covers Cretan history comprehensively - ancient but also through to Byzantine era, Venetian, Turkish; War of Independence; and through to WW2. Also houses the Nikos Kazantzakis collection.",
          "Enjoyed to see the place. Everything was very well organized and easy to find, not too much. The historic rewiew of El Greco was interesting and made me want to know more about this person. And the outside garden wit a cup of coffee to relax was also good. Here you can sit down",
          "Would recommend to anybody who is in heraklion to pop in. Great collection of artifacts ! They have minoan, classic greecian and some roman pieces.",
          "Despite the Folk Art on the second floor which was charming, this is a dull museum. It has a pleasant cafe' looking out to sea, where you can rest your legs!!",
          "This is really small museum, situated on the sea side just next to st.Peters church. It has hot 4 floors full of historical artifacts. On the the best piece of history - a collection of ancient statues and tops of columns. At the top floor are two small rooms with 20th century",
          "If you have interest for Crete\u00b4s history: Go to the historical museum in Heraklion. It's a little museum, but you get a good experience of Crete's history",
          "A very nice and well-organised museum for the rich history of Crete after the ancient period, covering byzantine period, middle ages to WWII. For the ancient period see the archaeological museum.",
          "I am not a museum bug cause the museums usually doesn't follow the demands, slow and missing concepts. However this one is really interesting, we have visited this one with my wife after the archeological museum and I can tell we didn't feel tired at all, only at the end when we",
          "They close at 17:00 we came there at 16:30 and they asked us to . leave we examined as much as we could but it wasn't enough",
          "Beautifully set out. Easy to follow the lay out unlike some museums where you go round in circles. Unfortunately it shut at 5pm and we had not quite seen it all.",
          "A lot to see, from pre historic to modern day. Three floors with a nice cafe for a mid way break. Audio guides are adequate but not super informative. Good signage in English.",
          "From ancient to modern Crete. There were exhibits on El Greco and Nikos Kazantzakis. The audio tour is a bit enjoying as you have to enter the number every time.",
          "This was my second visit and I will definitely go again. After spending more than 3 hours it was impossible to take in more but there are still things I need to spend longer studying. The special exhibition of El Greco was very tastefully done and a friend who has been to a top",
          "Very much focused on telling the story of Crete, right up until modern times. It seemed relatively impartial and didn't seem to have any political agenda.",
          "Great museum , that must be visited to understand the history and the culture of Crete which is a mixture of several influences from the Minoan civilisation to the Ottomans do not miss the last floor if you are interested in getting acquainted to the traditional life in Crete",
          "Always, when my foreign friends are visiting, I'm providing a tour toward the museums. Worthy to visit. Something different, and in a very nice plaza to spend later on your time for a coffee or a snack or lunch.",
          "As a numismatist, I particularly liked the impressive display of Cretan coinage through the ages. I also enjoyed looking at the furniture and equipment to be found in old Cretan houses.",
          "You will see many interesting topics and all will excite you! You must visit this Museum! You will know a lot more about Crete!",
          "This is El-Greco Year so the museum staged an exhibition around two original paintings by Dominikos Theotokopoulos, a.k.a. El Greco recently acquired by the Municipality of Heraclion. The show focuses on the Venetian and Roman magnates who supported Theotokopoulos in his early",
          "Full of history without being cluttered or overwhelming. A tad crowded with tour groups but able to move through without feeling pressured.",
          "This museum is not as spectacular as the archeological museum, but still very much worth the visit, if you have some time to spare. Museum is very well laid out, has a nice atmosphere and includes archeological remains and history of Crete from the 4th century AD up to and",
          "I suggest to visit the museum with a guide , the museum is nice but if nobody explain you something you just walk around and loo at the things,The museum has a cafeteria too we eat there the food was ok.",
          "Well laid out and labelled items, well lit. air conditioned building. museum staff very well informed and helpful.",
          "Not as spectacular as the archeological museum, but does tell the rest of the story of The varied history of Crete. Very interesting.",
          "Staying on a beautiful island like Crete, one should make an effort to learn about the local history and culture. The historical museum gives this, and more. Recommended.",
          "I wish we had a guide to explain everything. It gets very tiresome to read a lot of little plaques. Although, I did learn a great deal! The museum has a great atmosphere and connects the past and present very well.",
          "During our travel to Heraklion two weeks ago, we visited several museums. One of them is the Historical Museum of Crete. The museum presents a collection of valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical materials depicting the history of Crete from early Christian period",
          "It covers quiet several periods of Cretan life and you leave with the sense that you learnt few things for the locals in the present and the past.",
          "Modern Crete (post-renaissance) with an emphasis on El Greco and Kazantzakis. A very well presented collection with section on folk traditions and WW2.",
          "I went here with a tour group after visiting Knossos. It was great to see the artifacts found there and learning more about Minoans. I really enjoyed the frescos, jewelry, and tombs. I am told the museum is recently renovated and it is really beautiful. It is also very English",
          "Great museum with fascinating and well thought out displays. It makes a great first stop when you visit Heraklion as there is a lot of information about the local architecture and structures which you can see when you\u2019re walking around the town. It doesn\u2019t look very big from the",
          "If travelling to Heraklion in the heat you need to plan your visits to museums carefully, so I suggest to start from west going east and start first with the Natural History Museum then the Historical museum of Crete located some 5min walk from the first one and having the",
          "Just full of interesting objects and works of ancient art and history. A must see. We were fortunate to visit on National Environment day and thus the usual 6 Euros entrance fee was waived. It puts into perspective what wonderful art there was at Knossos and elsewhere on the",
          "We had travelled through Turkey and Greece, looking at all sorts of ruins and museums, but this museum was probably the best of them all! If you have the time (maybe 2 hours?), then absolutely go and visit.",
          "The museum is a quick and thorough introduction with photos, icons, jewelry, weavings, models and videos of the history of this much fought over island. For new visitors to Iraklio there is a large table top model of how the city looked a hundred years or so ago that is perfect",
          "Medium-sized museum over 3 floors, but packed with information, so that I ended up spending 3 hours here. There are ancient artifacts, mosaics, clothing, jewellary, paintings, coins... Well labelled in English. Don't miss the section on WW2, but don't watch the videos if you are",
          "If you want to find out the unique historical and cultural richness of the island, this is the perfect place to start and travel from the most ancient times to modern history. The artifacts are very well preserved, some of them also being a real joy for the eyes, such as the",
          "Wow, that\u00b4s all. There is just so much to see on original exhibits. Idealy a guide would make this a real experiance as there are many storeys behind each item and some very important exhibits could be missed.",
          "A museum that hosts a variety of items and themes from 400 till the liberation of Crete. very interesting and well curated in a perfect spot in Heraklion just by the waterfront",
          "This is a very well done museum that spans the fascinating history of Crete, from ancient times to the present. Well presented, with good interpretation of exhibits.",
          "Intelligently laid out. In many ways better than the touted but hollow archaeological museum. Don't miss Kazantzakis's study or the lovely and short essay on time in the folk exhibit on the top floor.",

          "We spent about 2 hours at this wonderful museum and found it highly educational about the city's and Crete's history. It was nice to have explanations in English.If you like history,don't miss it!",
          "This museum is very well equipped if you wanna learn more about Cretan history since the middle age, it doesn't offer enough information about ancient history (and neither does Archeological Museum, by the way). Anyway, overall is an excellent place to get to know more about",
          "This museum is very well equipped and it shows a lot of history of the Crete. Few years ago it was free entrance,now it is 5 euros. And everyone who loves history and want to learn something new must visit this museum.",
          "This museum is housed in a former villa and is beautifully laid out, something the Greeks are very good at. It traces the history of Crete both at a national and a local level and is a must if you want to know more about the development of the island.",
          "5 euros is the cost of getting in, and it was worth every cent. We spent a couple of hours and learnt so much about the history of Crete, it was fascinating. Could have spent at least another hour if we had it to spare. The exhibits are extremely well displayed, with",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours learning more about the history of the island. Helpful staff and well presented exhibits with information in both Greek and English Cost in Nov 2013 was just 5 euro Spent just over 2 hours looking rounf 3 floors but you could easily spend",
          "It had a great variety of information and articles on view, from the room that Kazantzakis worked in (He wrote The Last Temptation of Christ and Zorba the Greek) He was great writer and a brilliant thinker. I especially enjoyed his book \" The Saviours of God\" They also",
          "I ended up spending more time here than intended. It has numerous interesting displays covering the most of the period humans have occupied Crete. pros: displays organized by historical periods. Excellent Audio Guide providing hefty chunks of information for each display",
          "The museum has a wealth of information about Crete and more particularly some very interesting background information and places to visit in Heraklion. Very well presented.",
          "E5 entrance fee. In a beautiful restored mansion on the left of the seafront road, 10 minute walk west of Venetian Harbour - extremely interesting and informative with excellent displays relating to many different periods of Heraklion's history and the changes brought about by",
          "Lovely icons, interesting WWII exhibit, a superb relief of Iraklio over the centuries. The garden cafe is charming and there are a few books and gifts to buy. It is nicely located a short walk from the Natural History Museum and across the street from Mare, a wonderful",
          "This museum has so much to offer and takes you thru the history of Crete. Very well done, weary interesting. You can take a break while here and sit out on the terrace, enjoy a Greek coffee and look at the beautiful water.",
          "If you want to learn about the culture in Crete and its development, this is the place to go. It provides information regarding history, archaeology, tradition and much more. The place is easy to find, located along the shoreline of Heraklion.",
          "We could not find where to turn the flash off in both cameras and each time we thought we had it sorted, we'd click away and the flash was still there. We were still at the entrance and not even into the museum and one of the ladies kept saying \"no flash, no flash\". We should",
          "Having already been to the hugely disappointing Natural History Museum, we didn't hold out very high hopes for this place, especially as it was housed in what at first glance appeared to be a small municipal building; were we ever wrong! The museum itself is very well thought",
          "so much of interest could spend a good hour or so there,curators on hand to tell you anything you wanted to know.didnt mind you taking photo,s, entrance fee very good considering all that was in there,all in all one of the best museums in crete from personal experience.",
          "We ended up going to this museum after we had to abort our plans, due to transportation \"issues\", to visit a sight on the south side of the island. We went frustrated and were pleasantly surprised at how well this museum is laid out and presented. It does not get the fan fare",
          "This museum is a bit of a walk from the centre but such a little gem when you get there. The floors follow the timeline of Cretan/Greek history, ending with an amazing insight into Crete's part in the second world war. On the top floor are lovely displays of Cretan folk",
          "I recommend visiting this museum early in your vacation because it teaches you a lot of things about Crete's history and gives you an good understanding of what you see around you. It also gives you a great perspective of the place and helps you appreciate its beauty even more.",
          "If you have gone and seen Knossos go and see this as it has the real wall painting and other things found at the site!! takes about and hour to see but worth the time to add to experience",
          "We wanted to find out more about the German occupation and this was just the place to do it. Well laid out. If you want to go further back, then you can because it covers so much.",
          "Only one part of the museum was available. The statues were closed. The cost was four euros and am not sure if this included the fact that you only got to visit the first floor of the museum only. We visited Knossos Palace prior to visiting the museum in the same afternoon. It",
          "I learnt that the history of Crete is even more complex than I thought it was. I gained a little insight into the proud, indomitable character of the people. May the island now enjoy peace and harmony. Much integration has gone on, as well as war and tyranny, it seems. I did",
          "Whilst on Crete, I made the decision to visit the Crete Historical Museum and I must say.....I do believe that it is well worth the time and money to make the visit. The museum is very easy to find and is just a stones through away from the harbour. Once inside the museum, the",
          "A sporadic collection of exhibits showing all facets of Crete and its history. Downstairs a little dull - start there Upstairs much more interesting and relevant If going to the archeology museum as well, buy the joing site discount ticket. Well worth doing both.",
          "Historic City map in relief helped orient one to future exploration; the folk objects reminded us of the Benaki in Athens, just smaller and as interesting.",
          "It's not a big museum, but that's not a big problem. Sometimes in the really big ones the exhibits overwhelm you. Here you get a nice picture of the history of Crete up to now. I especially liked the ground floor, where you had the old Heraklion. I read a lot of the writings",
          "Beautiful collection of artefacts in a modern air conditioned building which can be a relief from the weather whilst soothing the soul.",
          "This is one of the best small museums I have visited in a while with everything laid out well, sensible organization and very informative. If you are a Zorba the Greek fan then visit to see the 'reconstructed' library of the author, there are a couple of El Greco's for overs of",
          "First visited here in February 2004 and the museum was struggling with limited displays. Now this building of four floors with sea views has the most marvelous exhibits. The history of Crete is explained in relation to the strategic importance of the island and covers the last",
          "I was very impressed at how thorough the exhibits were without being overwhelming. I hated history in high school so I was clueless as to the past of the island. Therefore, I took my time reading through each blurb in the first room and it was a great background for what was in",
          "Beautifully set up, comprehensive but not overwhelming. Excellent explanations in English. Have a coffee in the small cafeteria with a great view to the sea.",
          "This museum was a late addition to our itinerary and we were glad we visited. It provided an excellent overview of the history of Crete and the culture of the Cretan people. There are good exhibits of artifacts, artwork, and sculpture from around Crete, and a nice display of",
          "Really enjoyed this museum and its coverage of Crete's rich history and of the local items on display. I particularly liked the section of Crete's favourite son, Nikos Kazantzakis, recreating his study and displaying some of his works, including art. The WWII section also",
          "I really liked this museum. The first floor is a bit dry, but there is a whole section about Crete's involvement in WW2 which is really interesting (I\"m not a history buff). The top floor has a nice section about Cretan life. It only took about one hour.",
          "Excellent museum that covers all the history of Cretes , not to be missed .Cretes has a history with the Roman Empire , The Ottoman Empire and an active role during the world war II, in addition to contributions by writers,movie Directors and thinkers. The collection of Photos",
          "This museum was excellent. It wasn't very crowded so i am not sure many know about this museum. It has wonderful exhibits and all the history of Crete. Not to be confused with the archeological museum, this Historical Museum deals with the most recent history of Crete. Don't",
          "I asked a Police about the direction and he directed me towards the Natural museum. But I found my way. They show the history from the 2:nd until the 20:th century and including a special room about the 2:nd world war and about how Crete become to be an part of Greece. They",
          "A definite stop off! very informative with a interactive model of the city in the past and a optional audio tour for 3 euros.great artifacts and information on more modern history like world war two. great if you like history and art! Free EU student entry also!",
          "I like very much the room with the themes of Battle of Crete and El Greco and Byzantine paintings. Also the Museum has a room dedicated to Kazantzakis, very interesting.",
          "There are the usual items relating to local history, including a very nice table display of how the city looked in the 1600s with relevant photos showing how the ancient buildings looked later and some, now. A large room explains the atrocious behavior of German troops during",
          "Lots of great historical information and amazing up front and not-even-plexiglassed or roped off artifacts from a thousand years ago. Only thing that knocked this down a star was the overzealous docent who quite literally followed us wherever we went. It was ... unnerving.",
          "We took the \"hop on, hop off\" bus around the island, and this was one of the stops. It does not look like much of a museum from the outside, but looks can be deceiving! It looks like just a store front or gift shop from the street, but there is a lot to see when you are",
          "During our cruise on board the Queen Mary 2, we were scheduled to visit Athens but bad weather forced the ship to divert to Crete where we spent a day in Heraklion. For a port city, it was quaint and busy (probably caused by the influx of 1,000 cruise passengers for the day!).",
          "If you have a couple of hours to spare then you must visit this lovely museum, right on the waterfront and adjacent to a small square with some excellent fish restaurants. The highlight for me was the history of the Island; you can fill in knowledge gained from the Archeological",
          "The wharf was amazing. The architecture of the city was beautiful, the locals were so friendly, and the weather was fantastic! What can I say? There is nothing as lovely as the Meditteranean",
          "This is a must if you are Heraklion - or anywhere in the world! We were 'picked up' by the Director because I was interested in the Battle of Crete and I have never been shown such kindness and interest - particularly ironic as the Brits pulled out of Crete at the crucial moment",
          "Excellent way to get an idea of the island's history from pre-Roman times through Turkish control and very interesting WWII. Several floors....allow 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
          "I really appreciate the setting and exhibits, the chronomogical display and the variety of exhibits. It seems to be a professional setting with expertise.",
          "Lots of interesting exhibitis, but it was made much more informative with a licensed guide to explain what you are seeing and how it relates to Cretan history. The section on World War 2 in Crete was very good, and compensated for the fact that the Museum devoted to this topic",
          "The Historical Museum of Crete is not to be confused with the Archaeological museum that has been under renovation for several years now close to the main square in central Heraklion. This museum is a 5 minute walk along the port road from the old Venetian harbour. Walking in",
          "Quite a few of the reviews in this section appear to be describing the Heraklion Archaeological Museum and not the Historical Museum. Ignore any that refer to the Minoans, or 3,000 years of history; this museum deals with more recent times. It's a good museum.",
          "My girlfriend and I went there in the evening, before dinner (19 - 21). It is really a place worth visiting. The exposition is overall fantastic (even if we couldn't see from life the Del Greco's paintings because they were both temporary lended to other museums) and it is not",
          "The main attraction of this museum is the wonderful jewellery dating from 3000BC and the frescos from the Minoan Palaces on the island of Crete. After that unless you are seriously interested in pottery take a quick look and get out to visit the actual archeological sites.",
          "Only place to see relics from Knossos. A must stop if you visit the historical site first. Incredible things to see from the Ancient Minoans. Only part of the museum is open now, but a must see exhibit.",
          "We have enjoyed the visit, not long, interesting and representative choice of exhibits. The children also enjoyed.",
          "We thought the display was very good and full of interest to travellers in Crete .The building seems newly renovated",
          "This museum is small enough not to tire and big enough not to bore. A truly fascinating story presented more or less in a nutshell. Well illustrated with exhibits as well as enough text for the more inquisitive. Do visit this museum if you are interested in the history of this",
          "An interesting visit with plenty of good information about the island of Crete. The best thing was that there was a Starbucks very close!",
          "Well structured and not boring as it covers the rich history of crete after the romans and the greeks.",
          "a very interesting museum full of history and lots to see and wonder around, loads of items that have been dug up and preserved",
          "This museum is a must see if you want to understand something of the (rather tumultuous) history of Crete, from prehistoric times to now. It is very nicely set up, there are lots of explanations (in Greek and in English) and some of the artifacts are stunning: pottery and",
          "I spent one week on Crete island. There are 4 towns in this beautiful island. you need a car to get around .Heraklion is a highlight one with historical site ,mueum and aquarium. I stay at Rethymno which is in the middle. enjoy food although expensive !! tip choose a",
          "Everybody who visit Crete must see this excellent Museum and visit Knossos. To visit Crete and not see The Prince with Lilies is like a holiday without sea and sun. Enjoy Crete and Cretan wine!",
          "Is not a big museum therefore you will spend only around 1 hours. Is very well organized with a lot of information in English language. You will see the history of Crete island starting from ancient time, arab - venetian - ottoman period, their independence period and the union",
          "I liked very much .It is interesting and rather different than some other museum in the area .Have in mind that it is quite small.",
          "As the Archaeological Museum was under renovation, this was a lovely museum to explore giving some interesting background of the island and the city.",
          "Though not very in depth, the museum gives a great look at the history of Iraklion and the island of Crete: pictures, ancient weapons, archaeological finds, documents, etc. The museum has a great modern fill to it, with iPads and touch screens and so on. Between the exhibits you",
          "You can see the history of Crete,not only the Minoan civilisation.Interesting exposition.Very pleasant to go",
          "Igor to see... but this museum didn't offer much! Stuff total selfish and very personally orientated. In many question they was not able give answers. A young man who try give some orientations showed clearly the nationalistic feelings. A young lady in a level of guide museum",
          "The historical events are still in hearts of Cretans. It's good to find out why. The WW2 part is really incredible. I did not know that the Germans (Nazis) have killed over 40% of the Cretan population.",
          "This was a wonderful museum, nearly as spectacular as the Iraklion Archaeological Museum, neither of which I would advise missing! The Historical Museum of Crete hosts a wide range of attractions from beautiful Byzantine art, to two small El Greco paintings; a history of Crete,",
          "Well presented, well organized small museum that will give visitors a very good idea of the richness of Heraklion's past. The small upstairs section on daily life presents an interesting selection of objects and costumes. The maquette of the city clearly explains its history.",
          "I loved the section on Byzantine art and artefacts, particularly the icons. Fantastic and moving display about the battle for Crete during WW2. Learnt a lot about Cretan culture and heritage from the 'folk' section too. A great museum.",
          "This is a lovely museum which is a good size - not too big or small- the main collections are superb and there is always a changing exhibit. Eveything is well laid out and there is even a small cafe if you need a break. Staff are helpful and low key so your visit is relaxing.",
          "Very well sorted historical museum. Great monuments and historical pieces. Nice travel to the past.",
          "Anyone with any knowledge of Greek history would be aware that it is tumultuous to say the least. This is excellent and tries to give any visitor an insight into the history and different periods of Crete. The items on display are accessible and easily understandable.",
          "Interesting for World War II although not a lot about Australians and the part they played in the war",
          "For collectors and people who know and can appreciate quality.This is one of the finest small museums full with substance and very fine and rare quality artifacts which cover the full Cretan-Greek History From the Minoans the Byzantines , Venetians .Extremely rare and difficult",
          "Short, sweet and very informative. A story board for the history of Crete and one whole room for WW II history. Great for teens with short attention spans.",
          "This place takes a little finding, but is well worth the effort. It's so easy to think only of Knossos and the Minoans here on Crete, but there is a great deal more to the history than this - Venetians, Ottoman Empire and Germans to name but three. Go - you'll not be",
          "This is another beautifully laid out museum which gives a real insight into the life and history of the area. It massively enriched our stay. And even here, the cretan welcome was lovely. We were made to feel like honoured guests, and when it sadly came to closing time, we",
          "This museum is easy to overlook as it does not get the fame and recognition of the Archeological Museum, which is a shame since it is a fantastic little museum covering the history and artifacts of the city history especially focusing on the byzantine and following eras.",
          "We'd read about this museum in the guide books and we were all really looked forward to visiting this place. However when me, my wife and 2 children (aged 4 & 8) arrived, my boys were met with dirty looks from man sitting in reception. We paid our entrance fee and walked around",
          "Situated on the sea front about 10 minutes walk from the harbour wall this museum was an unexpected treat. The exhibits are all very carefully labelled in Greek and English. The museum is divided into a number of rooms dedicated to different aspects of Greek culture as well as",
          "loved the items wide range of statues, gold, weapons and art and all well detailed in the wall plaques the staff were warm friendly and very helpfull but not much parking around",
          "One of the best museums I have ever visited. Only small but what you get to see is terrific, some of the gold items are quite exquisite. Considering the age of many of the items on show, they are so well preserved and with workmanship that I would not have believed possible.",
          "Historical museum of Crete was a pleasant surprise for me. It represent history of Crete from Byzantian times to 2. World war. Visitor start's its visit in rooms in ground floor where are displayed model of Heraklion city and maps of Crete island. In next two floors you can see",

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "Gouves (Greek: \u0393\u03bf\u03cd\u03b2\u03b5\u03c2) is a village and former municipality in the Heraklion regional unit, Crete, Greece.

It lies around 20 km (12 mi) east of Heraklion.\nGo\u00faves is often confused with its busy summer resort, K\u00e1to Go\u00faves. Besides this well developed tourist resort with long sandy beaches, the area has some traditional villages and archaeological sites and Eileithyia caves. West of Go\u00faves are the tourist resorts of Kokk\u00edni H\u00e1ni (also spelled H\u00e1ni Kokk\u00edni) and Amn\u00edsos, both with similar attractions, and, to the east, Crete's largest resort, Hersonisos.\nK\u00e1to Go\u00faves, just a couple km north of the village, and is a summer resort.

There is another Minoan villa in the area dating from 1600 B.C., where some frescoes that are now in Heraklion Archaeological Museum were found.\n\n\n=== CretAquarium ===\nOne of the largest and most modern aquariums in Europe, CretAquarium was founded and operates as part of the HCMR. It is geographically located on the north-western part of the former American Base of Gournes, where together with the premises of the research institutions of HCMR forms THALASSOKOSMOS - the largest centre for marine science and promotion of the Mediterranean sea world.\n\n\n=== Dia island ===\nDia island is located 6 miles northeast of Heraklion city. it is uninhabited and the home of seabirds and species associated with coastal cliffs. It is one of the NATURA protected areas, due to its status as biotope for endemic plants. Legend has it that Dia island used to be a colossal sea creature that came close to Crete and then Zeus turned it into stone with a powerful thunderbolt, thus creating the island.\n\n\n=== Eileithyia Cave ===\nThis cave lies 1 km inland from Amn\u00edsos. It was an important sanctuary since Neolithic times. It was dedicated to Eileithyia, a Greek goddess of fertility and childbirth of Cretan origin. The cave is rectangular, 64m long and 9-12m wide. After the entrance there is an antechamber, which leads to a rectangular room surrounded by cylindrical stalagmites which were probably worshipped by the pilgrims. At the cave's mouth there is a square, known as \"The Square of Altars\". This courtyard may have been used in ceremonies. The cave remained in use until late Roman times.\n\n\n=== Gorge of Karteros ===\nGorge of Karteros also known as Astrakiano Faragi is located in the Municipal Unit of Gouves and can be entered by Karteros village on the southeast side. It is a hiking trail with ponds and small waterfalls.\n\n\n=== Kera Eleousa Monastery ===\nOne of the most important monasteries in the Municipal Unit of Gouves, located near Voritsi village just some minutes away from Gouves village. A fortress type monastery with significant archaeological ruins. Visitors can see the church, the monks' cells and the yard of the monastery.\n\n\n=== Minoan villa of Kokk\u00edni H\u00e1ni ===\nThe summer resort of Kokk\u00edni H\u00e1ni lies in Vathiano Kambo, about 13 km East of Heraklion and Northwest of Go\u00faves. At the spot known as Nirou H\u00e1ni, archaeologists found a well preserved Minoan villa dating from the New Palace period. The villa had two storeys, was about 1000 sq. meters large and had all the typical features of the Minoan architecture: two paved courts, connecting corridors, storage rooms, light wells, shrines, etc. About 40 tripods and huge double axes were found in some rooms, suggesting that the owner of the villa might have been a high priest. Like most of the Minoan buildings, the villa was destroyed by a big fire. The finds from the excavations are now displayed in the Heraklion Archaeological Museum.\n\n\n=== Monastery of Saint John Theologos ===\nThis monastery (Agios Ioannis Theologos in Greek) lies in a verdant setting southeast of the village of An\u00f3poli. It used to be part of the Saint George (Agios Giorgios) monastery, which is located to the North, which was abandoned following the frequent pirate raids  in the 15th and 16th centuries and all the monks moved to the monastery of Saint John. During the Ottoman occupation of Crete, the monastery hosted Cretan revolutionaries and  a secret school, something that lead the Ottomans to destroy it and kill the monks and the people of An\u00f3poli in July 1896. The monastery was founded again some years later.\n\n\n=== Skotino Cave ===\n\nThis cave, one of the largest of the hundred caves in Crete, is located high on a hill northwest of the village of Skotin\u00f3, a few kilometers inland south of Go\u00faves. It is also known as Ay\u00eda Paraskevi cave, this name coming from the church built on top of it. The cave is 160m deep and 36m wide. The first archaeological researches on the site were done by Arthur Evans, the well-known British archaeologist who unearthed and partially restored Knossos in the early 20th century. A more comprehensive exploration was done by French and Greek archaeologists in the 1960s. They found a number of bronze and ceramic votive offerings, the oldest of them dating from the earliest Minoan periods, suggesting the cave was an important sacred shrine dedicated to a female fertility deity, possibly Britomartis. The cave was still used in Classical Greek and Roman eras, when the fertility goddess Artemis or her Roman equivalent Diana replaced the Minoan deity.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFisher, John and Garvey, Geoff (2007).

          "We were going to visit Dinolandia when we saw the sign for the Aquarium so we had a 2 in 1 day. My kids 6 and 10 really enjoyed it. They seen already bigger aquariums than this, but this was just sufficient for our trips. Not to tiring for them...and us. The fishes are local",
          "My LO enjoys aquariums so felt this was a must visit for her and we were not disappointed. It was 10 euros to enter, and took about an hour to complete. It was informative in alot if different languages. There are lots of viewing areas too. Its also got a dinosaur park next",
          "This was a pretty small aquarium from the one's I have been to in Canada, but still worth the visit! They accept student international cards (half price) here and accept all forms of payment. It was only about 2 hours from agia marina, where I was staying, and we ended up going",
          "What a wonderful find on our holiday, we had so much fun and the cost was amazing. The facilities where great for families. a hidden (very hidden gem)",
          "Great aquarium spent an hour there today very cheap to get in , layout was great and all information was provided with each fish species in many languages which was great . The sharks were awesome fair play. Bit of advice AVOID THE RESTAURANT we had 4 hamburgers which 3 were",
          "We spent an enjoyable morning at the aquarium. It\u2019s not huge, but very well laid out. Common names of each species are in multiple languages. Nice cafe with a variety of food and drinks. We ate outside. Afterwards we took walk along beach. We took public bus from Heraklion",
          "All sea life is here: fishes, including big sharks, crabs, octopuses, sea horses, turtles, anemones and so on. All very well presented. Greta fun for adults and children.",
          "Lots to see here. All kinds of fish, including massive sharks, crabs, seahorses, octopuses, turtles and so on. All very well-presented in big, clean tanks. A great experience for adults and children. At first I was a little sceptical about the \u20ac10 entrance fee, but it was",
          "The weather was not so good so we decided to visit the Aqurium. The price was very reasonable 32 euros for 2 adults and 2 kids. There were quite a lot of different tanks with a large selection of creatures, including octipus, jelly fish, turtles, lobsters, sea horses, crabs,",
          "Cretaquarim is a very nice place to visit while you are in Crete. It is located not far from Herklion and you can reach it even bus public bus (a 25 minute ride, cost: 2 Euros). The Cretaquarium gives comprehensive picture of underwater life in the Mediterranean. Explanations by",
          "Stayed in Analipsi - got a taxi here on a rainy day, with low expectations - actually a great aquarium and worthy of an hour of your day here. Not much in the area though, so it's worth agreeing a taxi pickup time afterwards.",
          "Small and disappointing for the price you pay (10 euro per adult). We went there with 3 years old child (free entrance). The big aquarium is beautiful. she wasn't interested in any thing else. You can spend here one hour, max.",
          "Lots of fish species, a little bit expensive entrance ticket. It is open almost all days during the summer and there are sometimes many groups or schools so that could feel like crowdy. But I visited the aquarium during afternoon and it was great. I found it big and the pools",
          "Went here as weather was not so good it was well worth the visit, good price, lots to see. Cafe had a good selection of food.",
          "Rain, rain and more rain. Decided to take our 3 & 8 year old out and visited here. It was about 10 mins from our hotel and cost \u20ac10 in taxi, or \u20ac5.80 on local bus each way. Cost \u20ac10 per adult, \u20ac6 for child entrance fee - we purchased tickets from hotel reception and skipped a",
          "We took a group of 5 (3-8 year olds) and they had a fun time. A few interactive exhibitions and things to do. Not as spectacular as some other aquariums around the world but reasonably priced and a good use of time if a wet/windy day.",
          "We have visited the aquarium in January with not so many tourists so our experience was nice and not croudy. The entrance fee during winter period is 6 euro per person. The walk can be done within 30 minutes. There is a lots of small and some large aquariums with fish, sharks",
          "Small quaint aquarium, not as expensive as the uk ones. We walked down the breach to it from Gouves if you have little kids I would recommend you take the little train to it which stops out side. All the tanks were clean the staff were really helpful nice little distraction.",
          "Visited when we came to Crete in the October half term as the weather wasn\u2019t great one day. Can\u2019t say the aquarium here was anything special or to different to the ones we have in Norfolk. The sharks were good and the tanks were big. Tiny gift shop with no associated",
          "Don\u2019t waste your money. Tiny tanks over crowded complete nightmare. Dangerous to walk from bus stop. Don\u2019t know how they get away with it.",
          "This really is worth a visit when in Crete. As others have said, don\u2019t be put off by the area. The barren land makes this place feel isolated but the aquarium really is good. November\u2019s low season, so it was quiet, no queues and only \u20ac6 each to get in. We spent an hour and a",
          "As other reviewers have said the outside area from the road to the aquarium is less than inviting, take no notice this is very affordable and will occupy at least 2 hours with toilets and reasonable caf\u00e9 as part of complex. Discounts for oldies like me on showing passport but",
          "It takes an hour for a quick tour but I took 2,5 hours to examine everything. Very nicely and user friendly exposed. I felt very pleased after the visits, The live shark collection and the skeleton jaws of several species were the most impressive.",
          "Visited with my wife and 15 year old son. Surrounding area a bit run down but don't let this put you off. The aquarium is excellent with superb, clean, healthy fish tanks. It is also well worth paying a few euro extra for the virtual reality experience, a bit too real for my",
          "Don\u2019t be put off by the surroundings which look a bit run down, the aquarium is well worth a visit. Set on the site of an old military barracks near the sea, Cretaquarium is a modern aquarium with over 2000 marine inhabitants. This is the place to view a huge variety of fish,",
          "nice place to go on wet day think we should have done the virtuial bit too but didn't. Bit off main road and not well sign posted but go past big car park by dinasour world and keep driving down little road towards beach. some tanks look empty but look close as a lot of small",
          "We travelled by bus from Heraklion , it\u2019s was a bit of a walk from the bus stop to the aquarium , but we knew about it and going through what seems to be a repurposed military base was quite interesting. Having read reviews I expected the aquarium to be a bit shabby. I was very",
          "The aquarium is not very large so it doesn't take very long to visit. If you've been to other aquariums around the world it's probably not very impressive, but it kept our toddler entertained.",
          "I had a car and on driving up to the place the whole area looks run down and closed - DO NOT let this put you off. A bit scruffy on the outside - inside the aquarium was amazing - loads to see loads to learn about and some very big sharks and other deep water fish.",
          "Here you see fish that you couldn't imagine that they exist! For me was impressive especially the sharks which I so much love:p They upgraded it now as they added something with Virtual Reality now(which I haven't been) and some new fish!",
          "We got to Heraklion earlier then expected to catch our ferry to Piraeus and decided to check out the Cretaquarium. We got there pretty late in the day and the place was almost empty of visitors. Our family had a wonderful time checking out the clean displays with lively fish.",
          "Visited with my other half and 9 month old. Really nice aquarium a couple of big sharks and nice ambience. Walking distance from Gouves and currently off peak so only 6\u20ac for adult rather than 9\u20ac.",
          "Loved it, very rich of species. Especially loved the jellyfish tank. It was somehow very magical and hypnotic. And little baby nemos were also cute.",
          "We loved our visit to the aquarium, very rich species of fish and turtles! It s very nice for kids also!",
          "It\u2019s not your typical seen one seen them all sealife centre. It was different to that. Surprising shark tank and just lived the jelly fish. We are not talking sea world standard here but definitely up there with the smaller uk aquariums. Well worth the visit.",
          "To be fair, Greece does not have a tradition in aquaria, so this is not such a bad effort. However, the tanks are rather small and the fish variety rather limited. Educational material for children is minimal, and labeling / background info on the showcased is disappointing",
          "Cretaquarium is located in an area that looks quite abandoned. The facility itself is quite dated and charges \u20ac9 for adult entry. We found ourself finishing the entire aquarium at about 1hour. The species shown aren\u2019t any other and in my opinion even more limited then aquariums",
          "I think it\u2019s one of the best aquariums in Europe. You can see many kinds of sea creatures and they take care of them very good. Very good for children also.",
          "Typical of similar aquariums around the world. It's clean, bright and informative. It's good value for money and a good way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Entry is \u20ac9 per adult with \u20ac12 for entry with a 3D experience (which we didn\u2019t opt for). The aquarium is in an old USA army base and a good idea for reusing the site. There is free parking nearby with an on-site cafe and restaurant. The exhibits are good with a great main ta k",
          "Did have huge expectations but it was fantastic and the whole family 12 yrs - 74 yrs old all loved it.",
          "We took our children to the Aquarium during our holiday. My son has additional needs and the staff were very supportive. We really enjoyed the visit, some really interesting exhibits. We loved the sharks!",
          "Big and nice aquarium. It's worth to see. Easily accessible with local bus but the bus does not go down to the aquarium so you have to walk a lot from the bus stop. If you arrive with local bus you can buy the tickets cheaper and without queueing at the bus stop from a person",
          "Nice place with many kind of fish, there is a restaurant if you are hungry, and a nice shop to buy some souvenirs",
          "The aquarium is pretty oool, there's a nice variety of sea life to see. The VR experience is also pretty cool, worth the visit.",
          "Unlike Dinosauria nearby (which is dreadful) this is a great venue. Wonderful displays of fish and other aquatic creatures. Clean, interactive, and fun.",
          "was near out hotel so we took a look. Really nice place, with big variety and well organized . Good for all ages .",
          "We went to the auarium by bus from heraklion. You can buy a discount ticket to the aquarium in the central bus station or, where the bus stops. From where the bus stop you need to walk about one kilometer. The aquarium is not to big. We spent about an hour. Nice display of",
          "Went here with our 2 year old . The place is great, a lot to see. Their fish collection is very impressive. There are also some pretty big sharks. The entire family enjoyed it.",
          "Very nice, lots of species, clean and well organized area. Very nice for children, as they were impressed.",
          "This was one of the best aquariums I have ever been to. It was ashame about the screaming kids but thats normal and nothing to do with this amazing place. It was very busy though. So much to see. The surrounding area is falling apart and it would make a great USA airforce",
          "We went with our 3 years old boy, it is about 45-60 minutes. the fish are very nice, and there is a great view of 2 giant sharks and some other fish. there is a parking lot close by which is free. and a place to buy snakes/food/ice cream and drinks at the end. it costs 9 euros",
          "Visited with our 4 year old, spent a good few hours here. Lots to see and very intresting. The sharks and turtles are a highlight. Worth the price and the trip out.",
          "It's a 5-10 minutes walk from the bus stop,catching the bus gets you a 1\u20ac discount. Spent 2 hours wondering around the exhibits. Excellent value for money. Will entertain both young and old.",
          "Well organized, huge and amazing variety of sea animals. Absolutely loved the seals. I thought the time you were expected to spend at the Aquarium was going to be too long but we spent almost 3 hours in there. Definitely to be recommended for young and old. Amazing!",
          "Wide selection of sea creatures on display. Beautifully presented animals and plants including sharks, rays and jelly fish. Educative about sea pollution and wildlife protection. 1-1.5 hours are plenty to walk around. Recommended.",
          "We had a great time in the aquarium! There are a lot to see and we enjoyed ourselves a lot, but our five year old did become somewhat bored after a while. Worth mentioning though is that we had just been at the other aquarium that is also a reptile rescue center and had \u201cthe",
          "The owner of our apartment recommended we visit here. It's accessable on public bus, although quite a walk from the road It's situated on an old American Army base, the site is full of interesting abandoned buildings. The aquarium is housed in a large building near the sea. It",
          "It\u2019s quite a small aquarium but we still managed to spend 3 hours here. The sharks were amazing. They packed loads into a small space. There is also virtual reality but children under 12 can\u2019t use it",
          "We didn't expect much but were pleasantly surprised when we went in. A really good selection of marine life that you can see up close. I would definitely recommend a visit and it was good to get out of the heat. Don't let the abandoned army base on the way put you off!!",
          "Really enjoyed our day trip here, in fact was one of the highlights of our holiday. Our toddler son had been very poorly & we needed an activity that was out of the sun - this was perfect. Spent a couple of hours wandering around and our son was mesmerised. Visited the cafe",
          "If you need a break from the heat (you will!), the Cretaquarium is fantastic. It's small and I really wasn't expecting much to be honest (as we have visited huge aquariums all over the world), but was pleasantly surprised how much we all enjoyed (kids 10 & 13 at the time).",
          "Nice and tidy! Large bassins and lots of sealive to see including huge sharks. Also very educational. They have self grown clown fishes (Nemo fishes). Didn\u2019t know they were that small \ud83d\ude06. Adults prices are a bit high for this experience I think (8euro) but kids (4 euro) from 8",
          "Not very much to enter and for the price you pay you get quite alot out if it. The fish seem to be well kept also there is a nice gift shop and an vr for children aged 12 or over, only problem is the amount of people.",
          "Visited this as part of a tour. Smaller than expected however plenty to see. Very clean and tidy and great viewing points. Great place to pass some time and for young children.",
          "Visited July 2018, very well put together aquarium with lots to see, excellent value for money too at 9 Euros per person, worthy of a second visit to appreciate everything there is on offer here to see and learn about. Many languages are catered for, some nice quirks and a very",
          "We went here from Agios Nicolaos as a part of a short trip to Hersonisos. I'd say we enjoyed the experience. The aquarium is not huge, but not small either. There are plenty interesting and fascinating species to see (even though there are also some boring fish to be honest).",
          "Had a lovely visit round the aquarium. Lots to see, the tanks are all clear and easily accessible for children of all ages. They cater for many languages, with all tanks/displays translated in many of the popular tourist languages. Perfect for a couple of hours if you want",
          "If you are a fan of the sea world, then this is the one place you have to visit in Crete. The second biggest aquarium in Europe. Great range of fishes in a very good location",
          "I\u2019ve visited a lot of European aquaria and this one is okay. It\u2019s good to see they have an exhibit about plastic pollution but it isn\u2019t very prominent. They have a good range of species and some interesting information. The multi language labels also help to appreciate the",
          "I have been to almost all aquariums in Europe and I can tell that this one has it all. It has all Mediterranean species, turtle's, shark, clean beautiful, big. If you haven't been to an aquarium before you will love it, if you have been before to londons or Berlin... it is",
          "Decided to visit the aquarium as recommended in top 10 attractions. The aquarium is average compared to the sea life centres in the U.K. However there were some impressive displays and creatures. Our favourite was the octopus and clown fish",
          "Beautiful place with various Mediterranean Sea fish. Quite hot inside, air conditioning was not working. We have visited it in the afternoon on Wednesday. Not too much people inside. Possible to have a guide for extra money. Besides parking for the car.",
          "It was our first-time experience in aquarium. And we liked it. We spent there about one hour. We made a beautiful pictures of sharks, other unseen fishes, octopus. It was a cool time in heat.",
          "Went here with my family. Two kids 2 and 6. Completely fascinated with this place. Not too expensive and well worth a visit. Lots of species of sea creatures with some huge tanks. The two HUGE sharks are amazing. Never seen anything like it. The kids loved them. Spent around 90",
          "Very nice place with a lot of fishes, with children for aprx one hour trip. Aircondition place. We enjoy it.",
          "Good view into life under water in the Mediterrenean sea . Nice also for children,not too crowded (on a summer's monday). Also possible with baby stroller. Restaurant is rather a snackbar,but enough for a quick refreshment.",
          "Very well organized and very close to Heraklion. Audio device (extra charge) is well worth the money to those who want some more marine life details. Clean and nicely presented !!!",
          "Been there with my husband and daughter of 11. This is so little but very interesting place, excibiting sea species and reptiles.The most amazing creature is an almost blind sea turtoise! There was so nice girl, who told us so interesting and amazing facts about it, she was so",
          "It takes around 30min to see everything and there are not so many things to see. We feel the value received is not so good for the money paid.",
          "First time in this aquarium and I think the last. We were excited from the reviews and we took our daughter and we went. I have to admit that 9euro for one adult is tooooo much for this experience.So 18euro for 2 adults and one baby(free) for 30minutes(is enough). It was really",
          "Fancy a couple of hours out the sun and like marine life? Well this is your place. The whole aquarium is wheelchair accessible, so my wife could see it all. Like any aquarium there is a good variety of marine animals. Its nowhere near as big as sealife centres, but it is",
          "Had a most enjoyable visit! Thourghly reccomend giving this place a go. Not overly expensive and I learnt a considerable amount while I was there! There is a cafe on site and free parking. There is also a taxi rank outside.",
          "Now I know I\u2019m 30 years of age...but I don\u2019t mind admitting that I flippin\u2019 LOVE sharks! I just find them fascinating! So even though we had already visited the smaller Aquaquarium in Hersonissos (definitely worth a visit by the way!) I dragged my poor other half to Cretaquariun",
          "Worth a visit.Go and see the great variety of sea creatures.Prepare to spend a couple of hours there.",
          "Excellent place for a short outing with small children, kids enjoyed it. Well maintained and clean tanks. 9\u20ac per adult felt like a reasonable price. Not too big making it adequate for children to walk around in about 1h-1h30. Went by taxi from Creta Maris Hotel (Hersonissos),",
          "Great visit, Cost 9Euro for an adult ticket, which seemed expensive as it wasn't that big also there is an audio tour which you can buy for 3Euro. There was sand sharks in a massive tank with seats infront so you could just watch them do their thang.. :) There was a great",
          "Even if you stay further away, rent a car or take a bus to go there. Totally worth it. Fan-tas-tic! Some of the fish tanks have seats infront of them so you can sit down and watch. Mesmerizing, soothing, interesting, beautiful. Can't really say how long it takes. If you are",
          "I really liked it. We've visited this place with our 3 y.o. son and he loved everything there :) Some of animals were injured, unfortunately, but all in all it was still interesting to watch all the water creatures.",
          "We enjoyed watching all the reptiles and particularly the sharks. We visited the place by car, but it would have been easy to go there by bus as well.",
          "This an interesting and well laid out aquarium. It's not huge and you could run through it in 45 minutes but would you. The fish and sharks are great to see and fantastic to sit and watch, especially if you get a quiet moment with No hyper excited kids around. Kids will",
          "The truth is that there are not many aquariums in Crete, so the competition is low, but anyway this aquarium worths a visit. It is designed with an interesting architecture, and although small, you can enjoy an 1-hour visit without feeling bored or fatigued. It is also kids",

          "We really enjoyed our visit to Cretaquarium. There was a great range of creatures that all looked well cared for. We especially loved the sharks. However, for the price to enter we expected it to be bigger and were shocked when we reached the end after less than an hour. We went",
          "You are in for a real treat when you visit this place especially if there are children in your party. We went on a very warm day and it was a great respite from the heat. Large windows for seeing all the fish. Wide range of exhibits and information. We combined our visit with",
          "We stayed within walking distance of the aquarium so it was the perfect place to visit on the one morning during our stay that it rained. We spent a couple of hours there. The entrance price 9Euros is well worth it and we appreciated the fact that they don't charge for young",
          "It costs 9\u20ac for an adult and 6\u20ac if over 65 and is a great place to visit. The displays are great with useful signs and you can hire an audio tour. There are lots of different displays from jelly fish to sharks and some amazing tropical fish too. It takes around 1.5 hours to go",
          "Stayed in Gouves which as a family with a small child.. quite honestly became very boring.. so we walked along the seafront for an hour and came across this place.. the place was very clean and well run.. entrance fee was only \u20ac9. Each and my son was free.. breathtaking place..",
          "Great visit even for adults . Lots of marine life to see enjoyed seeing the sharks, turtle & octopus. Could have sat watching the many fish for ages. Information available next to each aquarium , also a gift shop as you leave. Afterwards we had a slice of pizza and a drink in",
          "Yes the title has full meaning for Crete's Unique place, amazing species of maritime world of Crete available to see, and observe in a great environment. Nothing to envy from other south European Aquariums.. Well Done!",

          "Recently visited this little gem while on hols. Only 6 euros each to get in (think sign read 9 euros for adults in high season). Although not a huge aquarium it's still great value for money, lots to see and do, friendly staff, very good and clean facilities. Information about",
          "Out of season it's 6 euros per adult and well worth it, there is a lot to see, many varieties of marine life, very interesting good location as well right by a good beach. Would definitely recommend.",
          "Very nice place with big aquariums and fishes inside. Very relaxing place and amazing for children. Entrance is only 6\u20ac and small children are free of charge. You can spend 1-2 hours and there are a restorant as well.",
          "Only \u20ac6pp entrance fee we weren\u2019t expecting much, but was well worth the money. There\u2019s plenty of tanks to view the sea life and lots of interesting information. The toilets were scrupulously clean and staff warm and friendly. However, the gift shop was disappointing with lots",

          "A bit of disappointment. Quite small and not really much to see. But it is Okay for a short visit if you do not know what else to do ion Crete. The biggest disappointment was actually Aquarium's cafe - we got served cold meals - everything was cold - starting from the soup and",
          "Interesting place, little bit small. Sharks, fish, turtles. Even the aquarium is small you can get good photos of animals.",
          "This place seemed to us an ideal aquarium for the little children. Most of the glasses are on a good level so that they can see everything themselves. It's not big so they don't get tired. Our 3 years old daughter explored it twice in a row.",
          "Good price for the size but would recommend only low season as otherwise you won't get a look in anywhere",
          "As aquariums go this wasn't the most expensive, there were several large tanks and a lot of smaller ones. There was information about human impact on the seas. There was not the variety I would have expected but there was some redevelopment going on. Surprisingly no shop,",

          "I came here because I love watching fish. This aquarium is understandably very popular : it is well laid out and there is plenty to see, from the tiniest of fish to really large ones. There were some interesting displays where you had to spot well-camouflaged fish in different",
          "Overal it was really nice and we saw a lot of interesting fish. The best part was their big sharks above our heads. Would recommend to visit it, not so expensive also. Only 6 eur per person, cheaper for kids.",
          "Had a great day at the Cretaquarium. 9 euros for adult well worth the money. Beautiful species of fish, sharks etc",
          "If you are over 65 ask for a senior ticket, the reduction is worth having. Best take your passport to prove your age. As Aquariums go, this is a very good Aquarium, nicely set out, plenty of places to sit with many interesting fish and crustaceans. Look out for the Video Wall",
          "Bus stops near the aquarium but then it's still a bit of a walk to the entrance. \u20ac9 for adults, 0-4 go free and \u20ac6 for 5-17 year olds. Open 9:30-17:00 in winter and 9:30-21:00 in summer. Lots of huge tanks with various sea creatures including sharks and a giant sea turtle.",
          "A very nice well laid out attraction to visit.Not expensive and well worth a few hours walk around.This is a good wet day activity too.",
          "Great experience for the whole family :) There is a lot of tanks and everything seems well looked after :) It\u2019s exceptionally good value at only \u20ac6 per adult during our visit!! Would highly recommend it being part of your holiday plan. Only strange thing is we couldn\u2019t",
          "This place is great for young kids. It has huge tanks, with loads of viewing space. All the usual fish and some very odd ones too, sharks, turtles etc. Our daughter loved it. Very much worth the visit!",
          "It was my first visit to aquarium. I wasn't very excited to go there. In the end I loved every bit of it. According to my mom, who was in aquarium in Barcelona and in the new one in Novosibirsk, this one isn't the top but definitely on a very good level. It has few big aquariums",
          "An absolute must see, very informative with lots to see. Stop for lunch at the onsite restaurant also very good and good toilet facilities.",
          "It is a large aquarium with a big variety of species (turtles, sharks, fishes, crabs etc.). My daughter (5 y.o.) enjoyed watching them moving for a long time and also she was surprised to find a section with bottles, packages and other trash. Good way to attract the attention of",
          "It was a nice trip few minutes from Limenas Chersonisou. There are lots of interesting tropical fishes. Maybe the exposition could be bigger and there could be more informations about animals. Biggest problem was small kids running and yelling all time so we cannot enjoy the",
          "It was a good hour to kill, however if the weather had been nicer I think I may of been abit more annoyed with the cost of it! But at the time it was a good time killer with a toddler and he seemed to enjoy it! I just found it very small! But I would go again if the rain was to",
          "Many species from the surrounding areas! We found this a great way to spend a rainy day. We were able to take the bus from Heraklion, and then it\u2019s a 10 minute walk to the aquarium. If you have extra time, stop in the dog and cat rescue as you pass to show the animals some love!",
          "Sadly it decided to tip it down, so we decided to visit the Aquarium. Overall very good I would say on the steep side price wise but a good experience by us. Little boy(2 1/2 yo) loved the big fish and sharks.",
          "Absolutely nothing special. I've been to couple of places like this and this was a waste of time. 20 minutes of seeing poor fishes in tanks, few skeletons of turtles. Keep away. I can't believe so many people rated this that high. I guess they have never been in places like this",
          "Visited with my girlfriend who loves any animal. Lots to see with good information about each tank which is always nice to know what fish they are. Only downside was it's slightly smaller than anticipated but very good for the size of the overall aquarium",
          "Easy access by local bus or taxi. They provide English audio guide to go around th aquarium. Good fun and very informative. There was a cafe inside or outdoor for refreshment. All clean. We took a very straight walk to soft sand beach in a couple minutes.",
          "At first i was nervous reading some of the reviews since we were going as 2 adults and no children, but it was great. Much larger than i expected at a reasonable price. Had a nice large tank of sharks which was the highlight. Serves food inside and out, didnt eat but it looked",
          "This is a large modern aquarium kept in very good condition, with information in several languages. The tanks stock an extensive variety of local sea life, and enough to stay for a least an hour or two. This is very interesting for children too, who enjoyed their visit when I",
          "The reason I left a 3 star (average) review is because the place is quite small. The restaurant facility was overpriced and the food wasn't fresh. Then again, I'm used to the London sea life experience!",
          "Our trip here was really enjoyable. The Aquarium ias a 20 minute walk from the Hotel we stayed in. Entry prices were excellent at only \u20ac6 for each of us. The layout was wonderful and had some really big tanks, affording us some amazing views. They had everything from",
          "This aquarium is worth a visit for families with young children because they will enjoy looking at sharks and huge fish although it is quite expensive ( 9 Euros for adults, 6 Euros for children - no family tickets). However, the lighting of the building is too low and the info",
          "The Cretaquarium is fairly easy to find, being well-signposted from the main highway. It's set in a lovely location very close to the sea, and has ample free parking. Being over 65 we paid only 6 euros each entry fee. Children pay the same price, except 5 years and under, who go",
          "You do not expect it until you get inside It is a very educative aquarium The installation are amazing with water tanks up to 600,000Lt You can see from a tiny artemia up to a big shark All very nice place in shaded corridors excellent work",
          "On the way from Rethymno to Ierapetra we stopped here during wery hot weather. Et reasonable price (9\u20ac) we spent nice two hours inside a/c interior. Great Variety of species, interisting info available, modern exposition. Perfect for children.",
          "This was a very nice place to visit. We were in a couple of aquariums before and this one is definitely in top 5. It has a lots of interesting tanks with beautiful fish and other sea animals in it, even our teen kids enjoyed it tough sometimes it's a bit difficult to find",
          "We had the opportunity to see the sea inhabitants of the Mediterranean. The highlights of the CretAquarium are the sharks and a lot of people trying to take a photo in front. There is a low light section with dusky grouper, red scorpionfish, crayfish, gorgonian, skate, my",
          "Great Aquarium esp for Children , located on the old American base plenty of parking anf close to the beach , also has a great little traditional restaurant.",
          "Aquarium is good and well presented but could be bigger with more displays etc not really worthy of the admission price",
          "Is a normal aquarium without anything special. Few small sharks, one turtle and a very small octopus.",
          "I took my 7 and 11 year old. The aquarium was small and repetitive. No gift shop. Drinks or ice cream was expensive in their cafe. I had 2 very bored children. Wouldn't go again. There is another aquarium in Crete so might be worth checking out but I haven't been to it",
          "Don't miss this visit... Kids and adults will love it. Mesmerizing tanks with all kinds of aqua life. Huge sharks, turtles,sting rays, medusas, tropical and Mediterranean fishes!!!totally recommend this place!!!",
          "Nice aquarium with a lot of different fishes, octopuses, turtles, crabs, etc. I especially liked the little squids which change their colour depending on the surface (never saw this with my eyes). The kids (6 and 3 years old) enjoyed this place a lot.",
          "just a 20/30 min walk from gouves holiday park it is within walking distance, we payed 23 eruo for two adults and one teenager great price, was probably in the just under 2 hours its not a massive place but well worth the visit, there are all sorts of different species of fish",
          "Very big aquarium with variety of fish. In the season its alittle bit crowded but stiil a great place to be.",
          "Visited with family, mid-morning in August. It was a good alternative activity (i.e. out of the sun and away from the pool/sea for a bit). Allow about 60-90 minutes to get round, depending on how engaged with the information you're likely to be. Slightly bemused that it was in",
          "This aquarium is based on the outskirts of Heraklion on an old US airforce base. Costs 8 euros for entry with ample parking on site (free). On the same site is Dinosaur land and access to the beach. The aquarium is well maintained with a superb selection of fish to view, child",
          "I would recommend it for a family with kids. I went there with two kids of 11 and 8. We hired a audio guide for each which I would recommend. You can choose from a variety of languages, not only the most common ones. The sharks are interesting and the jelly fish too.",
          "Very rare species, that never seen in other world aquarium, well positioned and service ed, spacious tracks, good signs for species.",
          "I have visited many aquariums around the world - This is very nice for kids to see (especially if they havent visited again a decent aquarium)",
          "Not a bad visit, if a little small. Some nice exhibitions, however, there were flies on the food in the cafeteria...",
          "it is a nice place to visit with kids who like to see sea creatures. it is also placed in the same area as the dinosaures park and the planetarium. so you can visit all at the same day.",
          "You need to visit this place if you are in Crete. Cheap ticket to enter and easy to find it on the map. We loved the sharks.",
          "Built among the ghost town of an abandoned army base, the Cretaquarium is most definitely worth a visit. Entry was 9Euro for adults and 6 Euro for children and most definitely worth it. The kids loved seeing all the different creature from the tiny camoflage cuttlefish to the",
          "I like fish and aquaria,so when I am on holiday, I often visit the local aquarium. The Cretaquarium is certainy not the biggest ne I have visited but it's very well done: presentation is really beautiful, explanation in many languages, fishtanks are well maintained and it's",
          "Visited aquarium with my family early evening on a sunday and found this a great time as not too busy. Closes at 9pm and takes about an 1hr to stroll around. Took the bus from Stalis (stop 30) to near aquarium (stop 9). Cost Eur 2.50 per person and about a 30 min trip. A 10-15",
          "We took the bus. You can buy aquarium entrance tickets at the port bus station along with bus tickets (and return trip). For two adults including bus to/from aquarium and entry tickets the grand total was 24\u20ac. Definetly worth it if you are interested in marine life. The",
          "No really, it was not that bad. It's average as far a aquariums go. Apparently the surrounding area has gone thru some hard times because it looks like a place the would test missiles at. In all honesty, the aquarium is good for kids, and adults. It is showings its age a bit,",
          "Not the greatest, think they could have made it more Mediterranean centric and pull it all together with the various Greek Islands... none the less, the kids loved it and with the money and the 1-2hrs spent here.",
          "We went to this aquarium to break up the week for the kids in the blistering Cretian heat and it was good. Perhaps we have done too many aquariums and I didn't really see much different from some of the others. It was a little far from koutoulafari and paying 22 euros each way",
          "There was a rainy day during our stay in Crete so we went to the aquarium. It was very nice and big enough, we spent there more than 2 hours. It could be interesting for children as there are also sharks, turtles, exotic colorful fishes etc. We were very satisfied.",
          "For those who never been to aquarium this place is \ud83d\udc4c and for families it's great. We have been to London aquarium so for us it was to small, but still you can see beautiful fishes plus they have beaches \ud83c\udf0a next to",

          "Easy access with the stroller, interesting even for very young children , awful food at the cafe , unwashed fruit salad",
          "Not just she,the two of us in our thirties we really enjoy it. With a baby it is a short visit but it was such a good way to spend time in shade. Also their kitchen is very nice.",
          "Excellent aquarium featuring everything from the tiny clown fish which they have managed to successfully breed to the impressive variety of larger fish and sharks in the main tank. We worth a visit.",
          "A much more involving and interesting aquarium than is first apparent when you arrive. There is an impressive collection of fish, sharks and other creatures. The restaurant looked and smelled very good although we didn't actually go in. There is a lovely beach which we did visit",
          "I expected a little more from this aquarium. There are a little species of sea animals. My son was excited at sharks and jellyfish but he was sad when it ended so quickly.",
          "It's quite interesting if you have never visited a big aquarium before because it's rather small. It is well laid out and the tanks allow great visibility. We enjoyed the ice cream in the restaurant next to the Aquarium and then we walked to the beach which is like some",
          "We are divers and we're happy to see the fish of Crete you can't see in the sea anymore as the Mediterranean is so fished out. It's a small aquarium but they do also have fish and larger Pelagius as well as smaller fish. Signs in many languages with an interesting wheel that",
          "Read some mixed reviews on TA before attending, so wasn't sure what to expect. We visited with two young kids, and loved our time here. 90 minutes was enough to enjoy this beautifully presented aquarium, and its nice collection of sea life. Some of the displays are very",
          "This aquarium is OK for what it has, which is not huge. Context is important here I guess. Seems that a place so close to the Med Sea would be HUGE but not so much. The displays were nicely done and my kids enjoyed it. I wonder if there are plans to improve or make it",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to CretAquarium! There are so many species of fish (sharks, groupers, bream, bass etc), octopus, mussels, molluscs, turtles etc. Some are indigenous to the Med and can be seen in the wild whilst out snorkelling, and others are from different seas giving",
          "Many who have not seen bigger and better aquariums around the world would be more pleased. Well kept and nicely lit. Some massive fish and plenty of them.",
          "Here are a lot different fishes, but the most exiting were sharks... few days before visiting it we were in \"Aquaworld and reptile resque center\" in Hersonissos and it was really more interesting and actually difference between two was in 3 eur, this aquarium cost 9eur, that is",
          "I visited the Crete aquarium with my wife yesterday. I have a background in biology and aquaculture, and am always interested to see aquariums in places we visit. I didn't have high expectation of this place but was generally pretty good. Was larger than I expected and we spent",
          "As a fan of aquariums of any kind and size I had to go to this one. It is rather small but again emphasises in Mediterranean sea life. A must see if you haven t had the opportunity to visit a large aquarium. A must see if you want to have an idea of the Mediterranean sea life.",
          "Nice brake from sun bath in a cloudy day with not much to do. Great for kids, I saw that they were very excited seeing underwater life. Sharks are the most interesting from my point of view, there was 3 or 4 species of sharks, other than sharks a lot of fishes, nice... worth it",
          "Highly recommend, especially if you have children. There is lots to see and do in the aquarium and the shark tank really is an impressive size! The fish all seem happy and well cared for and have much larger tanks than some of the other aquariums I've been too which is",
          "Went here on the spur of the moment and spent an enjoyable couple of hours wandering around. Whilst not a very large aquarium it was interesting and had places where you could sit and watch the marine life. Very relaxing and informative.",
          "The AquaWorld Aquarium is a gem on the area and it has all kinds of sea animals. Lots of things to learn about the ocean and how to protect it. When you leave this place you will feel that there is another world down under the sea so much precious and unique!",
          "Enjoyed and loved the place. i recommend this place. the price is 9 euro and not 6. Beautiful place. its for families with children a bit far from where i was (herssonisos) but worth the driving there.",
          "Just visited here with our 9yr old girl and friends with their 10yr old girl. My husband was a bit reluctant to leave the pool and slides for being indoors initially but admitted it was really worth it, we all really enjoyed it! Seeing the shark tank was by far the most exciting",
          "I felt this compared well with our local aquarium (the Deep in Hull) - it was well maintained and well laid out - there was good information in many languages. Yes, sure, there could have been more on different ecosystems, but for kids and adults wanting a relaxing and",

          "There are some seriously big tanks in this aquarium, it is excellent. Lovely tanks and environment. Good views of fishes and information on names in various languages, although not much additional information. Not as big as the London Aquarium but still well worth a visit, we",
          "We visited on a Monday and it was \u20ac26 for two adults and a six year old. The aquarium was really well set out and had a wide range of fish and sealife. The large tanks have lots of viewing areas so the children can see. There was lots of information in several languages and",

          "I will hold my hands up and admit that I did not even know there was an aquarium like this in Crete, We had hired a car for the week and saw the sign posts for creaquarium and decided to follow them, driving towards the aquarium you feel as though you are in a derelict town with",

          "I\u2019ve never been to an aquarium and eaten in the restaurant which looks like they are selling some of the exhibition for lunch all kinds of fish are on offer in the restaurant. It was reasonably priced to get in. There is good variety of fish from Nemos to Jaws they are in some",

          "In organized tour to heraklion, we stopped in the place as part of the stopp points of the trip. The place very clean and nice. The route is relatively dark so you can look at the animals, the place air conditioned and cool to a pleasant walk. Part of the track is boring because",

          "We visited the aquarium during our stay on Crete last week. It is a very nice place on the surface, but I couldn't help thinking that some if not most of the basins seem rather small for their inhabitants. Another concern I had walking through the aquarium was the high number",
          "Visited the aquarium many times during a cephalopod conference last week. We also had lunch there, as well as an evening meal next to the shark tanks. A great aquarium with lots of interesting and interactive things to see and do. P.S. - I think your unidentified fish in one of",
          "I have visited the aquarium before, back in it's early days and I was excited back then, but nothing can prepare you for the thrilling experience your child gets, when she or he sees it for the first time. There are no dolphin shows or stuff like that, it is more of a quite,",
          "We went here as a family. We walked from The Aphrodite along the beach. A fabulous walk in beautiful surroundings and sunshine. Great value for money and great fun. Lots of marine life to see",

          "Admission rates are slightly lower and no crowds. The turtle eggs hatching simulation was a hit with the 6 and 4 year old. Good displays of lots of sea life. The octopus is a fun show off, undulating on the foremost glass, tracing your hand movements and changing color. The",

          "This place is absolutely fascinating by lots of different kinds of creatures. You can enjoy it for as long as you wish. I think the entrance fee was about \u20ac 5 for one person. We really enjoyed it. Remember to have enough water in the summer months.",
          "This place is really good value for your money. We spent at least 3 hours one afternoon exploring this aquarium. This place is full of all kinds of fish including a very large viewing area for the sharks. We traveled from kokkini hanni by bus . Take into consideration its about",
          "It was a very pretty aquarium, although I wouldn't call it a must-see. It's for sure worth the 6 euro entrance fee, and they do have a very nice collection of aquatic life, some of which I haven't even seen at many other aquariums around the world I've been too. Don't expect it",
          "This aquarium is located a short distance from the bus stop and we went at midday (perhaps do not do this as the walk was taxing in the heat or perhaps get a taxi). When we arrived the staff were extremely friendly and it was an overall great day! It was great that beside each",
          "A very big and nicely made up Aquarium, well worth a visit. Very interesting also for kids with many fish to see. The have an interactive play corner for kids, where they can design their own fish, it was still in construction, but fun for the kids.",
          "That is a place that everybody has to visit, especially families with kids. Very impresive and very educational",
          "First of all: I do not compare it with SEALIFE in UK, Barcelona or Australia, it's a different size and range of attraction. It's nice place to admire sea life, with sharks, big fish, coral reef and deep-sea creatures. I do not regret time and money to visit this place ;).",
          "This was good value for money at 6 euros and you don't pay for the children till they're 5. There was lots to see, the display showing how turtles hatch and go to the see was excellent. Refreshing,y there was no shop at the end! The restaurant was good, reasonably priced and",

          "Visited in October with my 6 year old. Was very quiet which we liked, lots to see including sharks and turtles. Was very clean. Only complaint was there was nobody around to ask questions too and nothing interactive for the children to do. But still a great way to pass two",
          "It's a great place to spend an hour or so with the kids. The season is low and you won' see many visitors there, so you can enjoy a vivid sea life exhibition including real sharks",
          "Admission was \u20ac6 for adults and kids under 4 year old free. Aquarium was middle sized, but we spend around hour and half there. They had octopus, jellyfish, sea horses, shark, turtles and all kinds of fishes.",
          "We visited the Cretaquarium in September whilst holidaying in Crete. We really enjoyed our visit and thought the price of entry tickets were more than cheap enough when compared to other attractions! Although the aquarium isn't huge it is a good size if you wanted to kill a",
          "The aquarium is really big, comparable to the one in Vienna if you ever went there. Sharks, turtles, Nemo etc. Really nice fish. Some tanks were very big! Also really nice they have benches to sit on and look at the fish. The jelly fish are really awesome!",

          "Nice Acquarium near the beach, wonderful for children and for everyone, to see so many sorts of fish, a nice underwater experience.",
          "We spent a very happy couple of hours in the aquarium. It is actually a decent size, with a significant number of large tanks with a wide range of local species. Excellent value at \u20ac9 per adult and kids under 4 go free. Ignoring the somewhat derelict area immediately around it,",
          "Visited with 4adults age 30-64,a 5yr old and a 10year old, all saw something that interested them ,difficult to please such a range of ages! Great value for money. Not as large as others I have been to but it was a great day out.",
          "With \"voice guide\" is much better, but you must ask at reception (it's free of charge). All look nice, but it's only regional, accordingly don't expect colorful Caribbean fish. But its realy nice. Coffe in restaurant is also good. With kids must be awesome.",
          "Unfortunately I expected too much when we went and was slightly disappointed about the lack of exhibits in the aquarium, however i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who would like a nice few hours out. The big sharks in the beginning are by far the best, and of course you",
          "An enjoyable experience. Worth a visit if you're in the secluded area. The aquarium itself is well presented and speaks specifically about cretan marine life. All in all a satisfactory trip",
          "The first thing that strikes you when coming off the bus (just inform the driver or the ticket vendor on board where you want to go and they'll let you know when to hop-off) is the rather long walk, up to 10 minutes, in no man's land. Nothing but scorched earth and derelict",
          "The CretAquarium offers a big variety of animals out of the Mediterranean Sea. The audioguide is worth the money, because there is not a lot of written information. Don't expect masses of exotic things, the animals and plants there are native and that's what makes the aquarium a",
          "Very beautiful and interesting place which you should visit. It's very interesting and impressive place to see the also for your kids. You will be relaxed, impressed by the view after your visit for sure.",
          "Billed as one of the largest Aquariums in Europe, we expected the Cretaquarium to be bigger. However, we spent a nice couple of hours there and felt it was value for money.",
          "Nice aquarium, though a little bit off the beaten track from Gouves. only 9 Euro per adult and a good selection of fish, sharks etc. Information in several language about the fish.",
          "Not very big aquarium but really nice, especially the big sharks pool when you can spend long time by fascinating watching. Also the jellyfishes were great to see.",
          "very nice aquarium. entrance fee is appropriate, and not very expensive. the Aquarium is nicely designed. easy to read the explanations. nice exhibition. a would highly recommend if you have kids. Best thing is it is open till late (21:00 in summer), so it can be a nice tour",
          "Fantastic place in creta aquarium beach just in front and a restaurant with a very good food fantastic for children and family",
          "The aquarium itself was great and was ideal for small children as they could get up close to many of the fish and sharks. However we were disappointed that there was no gift shop at the end of our visit.",
          "Kids loved it and so did we. A very nice place, very well organized that everyone who visits Grete should not miss. The shark tank kept us for half an hour...!!!",
          "Pleasantly surprised at this aquarium. Big sharks with huge teeth, a rescued turtle and a great variety of fish and crustations greet you in an awesome backdrop of coral. Nice cafe on exit - a great way to while away an hour or so.",

          "Nice aquarium with some huge tanks. Good value trip and there is a nice public beach close by. The sharks and octopus are fascinating! But if you love aquaria you will enjoy it.",
          "A very common aquarium. Nothing exciting or entertaining about it. A max of one hour tour will be done. When I saw the exit sign I was thinking where is the rest. I actually walked back to see if I have missed any other entrances. If taking the bus need to walk a half mile. The",
          "They have 5-6 large aquariums others are the small ones. I was waiting a little more out of aquarium, but it wasn't that bad. Probably the place is more for kids. The most interesting thing is that there are 3 sharks which are swimming close, but other than that nothing more",
          "Small selection of sea mammals. Keep away at busy time unless you enjoy shoals of children. Easy to get too on the Heraklion to Malia road - lots of buses only \u20ac2. Big car park or 5 minute walk from bus stop. Old US military bases with lots of derelict buildings to walk past.",
          "Its a very nice place for a short afternoon visit. Its not the best in the world but its good enough for a few hours during a vacation. Nice big Sharks aquarium.",

          "It's always a nice idea to visit an acquarium when traveling with children, instructing and funny. This one is nice to visit, easy to reach (having a car) and all in all a good choice for a day. Mainly with Mediterranean species, but not exclusively, so it's almost interesting",
          "I have been to a few aquariums and I have to say both myself and the kids thought this was excellent. Some lovely big tanks, well laid out with sharks , jellyfish, turtles, Eels , fish, octopuses , cuttlefish etc. A very reasonable entrance fee as well. Takes about an hour to an",
          "We spent a hour here and saw a lot of variety of sea life.Its not as big as the Barcelona aquarium but still worth a visit ,kids will definitely like it here some nice big tanks and set out to keep the flow of people moving.You wouldn't need more than a hour and a half there",
          "long walk for not a lot.carried on to dinosaur world just as bad . very cheap and it showed.charged for other things when inside \u2026",
          "One of the best aquariums I have ever visited. And since it is a sea aquarium mikes it even better. You can see a variety of meditteranean fishes, from tiny ones to sharks. Very well displayed and there is enough information for every species. Bravo.",
          "Cool place to spend an hour- hour and a half max! Very small compare to Eilat and other similar places in Europe Close to the city center",
          "This was fun and we didn't even go with kids! There's plenty to see and the big tanks are impressive. You'll only need an hour or so to see everything. What I found a bit more interesting is that the aquarium is on an old US Air Base and you have to walk past all the old",

          "If you are in Crete with children it is a must to visit. Easy to reach by bus (station: Aquarium), and then 5 mins walk towards the sea. Worth buying combined ticket and see the side exhibition about ancient greek inventions too.",
          "The Aquarium was such a fun visit! Firstly the ticket prices were very cheap and for only a few extra euro you could visit the Greek History Expedition which was also being held there. There were many different types of fish and there were in very big tanks so the fish had lots",

          "There are a lot of different types of animals such as fishes, sharks, turtles, scorpions and so on. It's very interesting for children, a lot of information about the animals. It's worth to go if you have children or you weren't before in an aquarium.",

          "We had a fantastic day out here. Lots to see and well laid out. My only (small) criticism would be that some of the information boards could do with being a little better illuminated.",
          "It's a brilliant attraction to visit on Crete if you get the chance. There's various sizes of tanks with a beautiful array of aquatic species from green turtles to colourful rasps and massive sand sharks to tiny octopi. Well worth a visit.",

          "This is an interesting place to visit, especially for kids. You can spend around 2 hours watching a lot of kinds of fishes, even big sharks swimming behind the aquarium glasses next to you. Kids are really amazed by the site! Aquarium restaurant can do a lot better, even if the",

          "It may not be the largest of the world but still it is beautufully organised and is a great place for adults and children. Also, for those who want to listen to guide and to more information, there is the option of renting headphones and listen to particular details, as an",
          "A superb aquarium with 60 tanks, well laid out. Plenty of different marine species to see. Some very large tanks with the usual sharks etc. Nice clean new building, bit of a walk in the heat from the main road bus stop. Plenty of taxis waiting to whisk you away if you don't",
          "Fabulous, the tanks seem nice and large for the fish, with big viewing areas so you don't have to fight for space to see the fish. There was a huge variety of fish on display. I loved the gallery style seats where you could just sit and watch the fish. Despite the temptation",
          "We've visited there during our stay, A nice short visit, A lot of variety of fishes, There was also an ancient greek Technology exhibit in 2 euro extra, you can skip that, You can spend there an hour or two",
          "My 11 year old son and I visited the aquarium, we were unsure whether to go due to mixed reviews. However we had a thoroughly enjoyable and informative 3 hours spent there. Unlike several other reviews we would recommend the audio guide, without it your visit would be much",
          "Agree with some of the comments of other reviwers regarding the size (it could have been bigger). However you have the chance to spend some time next to really big sea creatures. We have visited the aquariums in Copenhagen and Berlin; they might be bigger in size but not so",
          "The aquarium was pretty nice but it wasn't a one hour visit. More like 45 minutes. As it is in a sea area I was expecting a bit more for the buck. The aquarium in Hannover is better, how can that be?",
          "Nice collection of fish. They have two species of shark. Worth a visit if you're near. Nothing else to add.",
          "A busy aquarium with plenty of fish and people. Among them there was a grouper (I mean the fish), which was just floating and gazing. I approached the glass and it came closer. We kept staring into each other's eyes for a while. Its partner came along and tried to prod it back",
          "The entrance was considerably cheep. 9\u20ac for adults and 6\u20ac for students.

          "Well presented and with some nice looking modern tanks, great variety of species but nothing exactly ground breaking, if your looking to entertain the little ones then its a safe bet.",
          "We found the aquarium a good way to kill an hour or so as it was a short walk for us but I doubt it worth travelling a long way for. 9 euros per adult, 6 for children. No real need to pay three euros for the audio guide.",

          "The Cretaquarium is a lovely place with some nice things to see. We went as a family and walked the 20 or so minutes from the centre of Gouves along the front. Having been to both the Blue Planet and a couple of the larger Sealife centres in Britain this doesn't quite match up,",
          "Small but nicely organized aquarium with some interesting multimediatic insertions. The main attraction is the white shark in a modern pool that allows him to swim above the visitors. Interesting and in some passes also educational for children.",
          "In no particular order, this place is very accessible, unpatronizing, clean and worth your while and money. Sharks are awesome. Good way to spend 1-2 hours, sip some drinks, take some photos and move on. Do not miss the little turtles slideshow demonstration.",
          "Unless you were staying close by I personally wouldn't recommend travelling far to come here. As a young couple i can't speak for families with kids but the 2 of us were a little dissapointed about how small it was and the lack of interaction from anyone working there. I found",

          "We visited here in July while on holiday in Crete. We had hired a car and found that it was easy to locate this aquarium. It is reasonable priced and there are a good range of fish to see and our kids enjoyed it. We seemed to go round the exhibits quite quickly and feel that it",
          "Can't compare with the big name aquaria of the world but they don't have the budget or audience either. Informative about Mediterranean if you are natural history buff and worth a visit if you have kids and need a half day away from the beach. I've been to several of the big",
          "Not Bad but seemed to have decreased in size compared to our visit last year. The shop has gone?? Not sure that's a good move, or are they deliberately running it down... it's a pity if they are because this really did show what can be found in the Chetan sea.",
          "Not so great,pic inside without flash so almost dark, but if you have seen other around you can skip this. Nothing wow !!",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed visiting the aquarium. We were surprised at how big it was and how varied it was. We are used to the Monterey Aquarium in California and though this aquarium is not as big, it is as nice. The kids (14 and 16) really liked it as well",
          "This was our second visit to the aquarium... our first was 6 years ago when our children were all under the age of 10. Our kids loved it both times. We have been to quite a few aquariums in Canada and the US and this one ranks amoung our favourites. We love all of the large",

          "While we enjoyed the aquarium and our 4 year old boys found it enjoyable for a while, it was a little bit boring. As much as I like seeing animals, I was a bit bored. It isn't huge and you can walk around it in about 1 hour. The surrounding area is weird - it is a deserted",
          "The aquarium worhts a visit, especially for families with kids. There is no other aquarium in Greece with so many species of fish. Our son saw for the first time a shark and a sea turtle and was very fond of finding the hidden fish. He was familiar with the majority of the fish,",
          "Not so impressive as some aquariums across Europe. But good enough to spend few hours with kids instead of one of your beach days. Sharks and jellyfishes included.",
          "I was really disappointed with the aquarium. Think they could do a lot more with it especially to keep children amused. There was no touch pools, no gift shop, apart from the fish tanks there was little else. Would have liked to have seen even quiz sheets or drawing area for",

          "A great place to be with kids if you are looking for a break from the heat and sunburning for a half a day. Reaaally interesting and amazing creatures to see and learn about them together with children. A great money spent. Totally worth it.",
          "Worth to see it if you are around and have 1h spare It is located between Iraklio and Hersonissos but you can get there easily by bus.",
          "If you have small babies it is a good choice. It is quite small but with many large acquarium with many fishes from warm waters to sharks and hyppochampos. The visit would be max 1.5 hours but very nice.",
          "We visited here on the same day as Knossos Palace and the aquarium was the highlight of our day! Walking down to the building from the bus stop on the main road takes around 10-15 minutes, and the surrounding area does make you wonder if you're in the right place (derelict",

          "From the outside it doesn't seems to be a VERY big attraction. But just step inside and start to look around, and you will know, IT IS! Nicely composed fish tanks and displays, real and healthy looking fishes. And so on... Very good holiday activity with children.",

          "With just 9 hours in crete, we checked out the Things to do on tripadvisor and saw cretaquiarium. We came here by bus. The aquarium is located inside the ex us Military base. so it was a long walk from the main street going to the aquairum. maybe 10-15 mins walk. We didnt",
          "We visited here at the beginning of june and the whole family enjoyed it. We went mid morning so it wasn't too busy. Plenty to see and good range of information on the different spieces in lots of different languages. My lasses (8 & 12) were fascinated by all the different",
          "Was totally amazed really worth a visit. When i seen the sharks teeth . It made me scared to go for a swim",
          "We were at the aquarium today (July 6th 2016). Lots of people were there, of course lots of kids, so it pretty loud although you can find signs that try to tell you to be quiet. Speaking of those signs, in the middle of our way through the aquarium they started playing Enya on",
          "For that price I expected more. It is very nice, but after 1/2 hour I had a question: is this really all? Nothing extraordinary: couple of sharks, turtles and some other fishes.",
          "If you ignore the long scary walk through deserted buildings from the bus to the aquarium, it's a nice experience",

          "Visited here with teens and a 6 year old, and it was enjoyed by all. Lots of information on all the exhibits and some interactive displays too. Educational or just great for anyone interested in marine life. It is limited in size so not a full day out, but a good place to spend",
          "Didn't take long to walk around but amazing fish to look at. Gift shop was closed sadly but ate in restaurant and lovely food",
          "We went there on a very hot day and enjoyed the cool air inside. Apart from the obvious attraction (sharks and moray) the jellyfish were the winners of the day (which is mainly due to a clever setup with interesting light). Since it was his first time in such aquarium our kid",
          "Sharks were great, very cool atmosphere, a place must to visit! we really have great photos there...",
          "Easy to reach, great price, beautiful variety, kids loved it! I recommend taking 1-2 hours and really looking at the aquarium and reading the text. It can be very educational for both adults and children.",
          "Visited the aquarium off the back of some recommendations but weren't overly impressed. 9 euros per adult to get in and we walked around the aquarium in under half an hour. Upstairs seemed to be blocked off (don't know if anything was up there and if not then that's probably",

          "Great place to visit with small kids. Has a lot of \"material\" to observe. Only wear some warmer clothes, inside is dark and a bit chilly.",
          "This was less than five minutes drive from where we stayed but would have travelled much further to make this visit. Well worth a visit with younger family and the sight of local kids enjoying the aquarium was a pleasure.",
          "Really small and really repetitive. Genuinely the worst aquarium I've ever been to. We were going to go to Aquaworld but wasn't able to get there. Wouldn't recommend however the cafe/restaurant was lovely.",
          "visited this aquarium with my 9 year old son and mother whilst on holiday in stalls. we got a taxi from our hotel to the aquarium which was slightly expensive but he waited the whole 2 hours for us and didn't charge us anything extra in fact he knocked a few euros off!! we spend",
          "Was not wothwhile visiting. Not much to see. Maybe it's because we were at the aquarium in Atlanta and expected a little more.",
          "We visited this lovely attraction on the third day of our holiday. What a fantastic few hours we spent there. Much to see and do and our little 5 year old daughter was amazed by all the different sea life. Would recommend this to any of the island visitors.",
          "For only 9 Euros per person, this attraction was great value for money all going towards the conservation of marine life.",
          "Great aquarium with a variety of fish to see. It provides information of the animals in several different languages which is useful. There is also a sea food restuarant at the end with good food which is a nice way to end the trip.",
          "My friend and I spent a good couple of hours in the Aquarium on a rainy day. Despite it being a rainy day, the Aquarium was rather quiet which was nice. The attraction is reasonably priced and easily accessible by bus from Heraklion.",
          "Generally enjoy these type of places although one is pretty similar to another. The sand sharks were impressive. Aware from earlier comment that the gift shop was shut and that seemed a shame as there were plenty of people there, including local school trips, and much revenue",
          "This aquarium is very good. It has different species, including sharks, turtles, jellyfish, and cuttlefish. The aquariums for the most part are well put together, and it is a nice and peaceful adventure. The cafe was good for lunch. To get there, purchase bus tickets at the bus",
          "Visited the aquarium today. On the website it advises you can take the bus. What it doesn't mention is the long walk which seemed little over a mile through an industrial estate in the blistering heat after you get off the bus. Once inside I was disappointed to find very small",
          "It wasn't the greatest aquarium we got round it within half an hour this just wasn't for me I expected more and I felt sorry for the animals because the tanks seemed so small",
          "Very interesting - lots of incredible fish and some pretty spectacular sharks too! There is also a little cinema showing interesting marine life films. Good for kids, and to get out of the sun for a while... Only 6 Euros to get in.",

          "I visited cretaquatium and was very disappointed by what i saw nearly all the tanks had the same fish i.e. grouper, mullet, slipper lobsters it was nothing like i expected also a lot of the fish were ill and in cramped conditions i wouldn't waste my money again and would also",
          "Good morning out at the aquarium. Very reasonable admission charges. Plenty of varied sea life creatures. Be sure to take your camera.",
          "At the Cretaquarium, one can observe the world beneath the waves without even getting his feet wet. This is found at the old US military base in the Gournes district.",
          "This is a nice aquarium, although the price for an audioguide (3) is a bit strange as there were a lot of numbers not working. Mainly in the beginning the tanks are nice and big, but further down the line i sorta lost interest. It's okay afterall.",
          "They have some interesting fish in their tanks. This is not the largest aquarium but it was worth the time and admission cost to explore.",
          "You can visit the aquarium, you can see impressive pools, sharks and other marine animals.Visit the aquarium in Hersonissos",
          "We had a really nice time, saw a lot of different fish and the audio guide was educational, the place was easy to find and the price was quite cheap. The only disappointment was that we wanted a really long time for a fish to camouflage itself and it didn't :D My advise is to go",
          "an amazing experience of shark - fish - medusa viewing, a must-see attraction of Heraklion. Beware of the sharks lurking behind the huge tanks.",

          "Very beautiful Aquarium... i loved it very much... a diversity of fishes... you can enjoy the experience of meetting different type of fish.. very lovely place.. after the Aquarium a walk on the beach will be a excellent end to your 2 hours... Entrance fees 6 euros",

          "My 5 year old son liked it, although it was off season and most of the species and exhibits are mediterranean. We visited a Friday afternoon, one hour before closing time, so we were practically alone. It's big enough to keep you interested. A decent try which is worth visiting",

          "We had visited many aquariums around the World. It was said that it is the biggest aquarium in Europe, but we were not impressed much. It has quiet a number of different species of sea life, similar to other places. There was nothing special what attracted us there. Not worth of",

          "The place is full of different fish species. Definitely sharks aquarium is the main attraction, but there is many interesting to see beside the sharks. 6 euro isn't a big price and the place worth a visit",
          "The Cretaquarium is about 15 min outside of Heraklion on the National Road. We went there somewhat jaded by previous aquariums in places like Monterrey, Atlanta, and Sydney--but were surprised at every turn by the colorful fish and other sea creatures. Extremely well-organized",

You can buy the tickets ahead of time online but because of COVID-19 that didn't bring us anything good because we had to wait on line anyways as prepercaution and person limit inside. I figured it would be a bit bigger but it's nice.",

Couldn't help feeling that some tanks were overcrowded but overall was pleased to visit and help keep this place open, very quiet probably due to covid restrictions and close to end of season in late September.

Maybe it's the end of the season and they will add numbers to all the exhibits so the audio guide will tell you about the Scorpion fish and others.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs.

        "wiki": "Rethymno (Greek: \u03a1\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf, [\u02c8re\u03b8imno], also Rethimno, Rethymnon, R\u00e9thymnon, and Rh\u00edthymnos) is a city of little more than 30,000 people (near 40,000 for the municipal unit) in Greece, the capital of Rethymno regional unit on the island of Crete, a former Latin Catholic bishopric as Retimo(\u2013Ario) and former Latin titular see.\nRethymno was originally built during the Minoan civilization (ancient Rhithymna and Arsinoe). The city was prominent enough to mint its own coins and maintain urban growth. One of these coins is today depicted as the crest of the town: two dolphins in a circle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis region as a whole is rich with ancient history, most notably through the Minoan civilisation centred at Knossos east of Rethymno. Rethymno itself began a period of growth when the Venetian conquerors of the island decided to put an intermediate commercial station between Heraklion and Chania, acquiring its own bishop and nobility in the process. Today's old town (palia poli) was almost entirely built by the Republic of Venice. It is one of the best-preserved old towns in Crete.\nFrom circa 1250 the city was the seat of the Latin Diocese of Retimo, which was renamed Retimo\u2013Ario after the absorption in 1551 of the Diocese of Ario and as suppressed only after the Turkish conquest.\nThe town still maintains its old aristocratic appearance, with its buildings dating from the 16th century, arched doorways, stone staircases, Byzantine and Hellenic-Roman remains, the small Venetian harbour and narrow streets. The Venetian Loggia houses the information office of the Ministry of Culture and Sports. A Wine Festival is held there annually at the beginning of July. Another festival, in memory of the destruction of the Arkadi Monastery, is held on 7\u20138 November.\nThe city's Venetian-era citadel, the Fortezza of Rethymno, is one of the best-preserved castles in Crete.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "The fortifications of Heraklion are a series of defensive walls and other fortifications which surround the city of Heraklion (formerly Candia) in Crete, Greece. The first city walls were built in the Middle Ages, but they were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the second longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\nHeraklion's fortifications have made it one of the best fortified cities in the Mediterranean. The walls remain largely intact to this day, and they are considered to be among the best preserved Venetian fortifications in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Byzantine and Arab walls ===\nThe first fortifications in what is now Heraklion were built by the Byzantine Empire. The city was captured by Arabs in 824, and it became the capital of the Emirate of Crete. At this point, they built a wall of unbaked bricks around the city, and surrounded it by a ditch. The new capital became known as Rabdh al-Khandaq (Trench Castle).Meanwhile, the Byzantines tried to recapture Crete from the Arabs because of its strategic importance. After several unsuccessful attempts, Nikephoros II Phokas managed to take the island in 961. The Arab fortifications were razed, and a new fort known as Rokka was constructed instead. Eventually, the settlement grew, and the Byzantines built new walls on the site of the Arab walls.Some remains of the Byzantine walls still exist near Heraklion's harbour.\n\n\n=== Venetian walls ===\n\nIn the early 13th century, Candia (modern Heraklion) and the rest of Crete fell under the control of the Republic of Venice. Initially the Byzantine walls remained in use, and they underwent various modifications. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the expanding Ottoman Empire became a major threat for the Venetians. Due to this threat and the discovery of gunpowder, they decided to build new fortifications around Candia. Construction began in 1462, and the walls took over a century to be built. Their construction was based on designs by prominent military architects Michele Sanmicheli and Giulio Savorgnan (it).\nOver the years, the fortifications were strengthened with the construction of various outworks, while the Rocca al Mare (now known as the Koules Fortress) was built to protect the harbour entrance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and recent history ===\nThe fifth Ottoman\u2013Venetian War broke out when the Ottoman Navy arrived off Crete on 23 June 1645. By August, Canea fell to the Ottomans, while the Fortezza of Rethymno fell in 1646. However, the Venetian garrison in Candia managed to hold out for 21 years, and the Siege of Candia remains the second longest siege in history. The city surrendered in 1669, and the Venetians and most of the population were allowed to leave peacefully, sparing the city from being sacked.After occupying the city, the Ottomans repaired and maintained its fortifications. The bastions were given Turkish names, for example Martinengo Bastion became Giouksek Tabia.The Ottomans also built a small fort known as Little Koules on the landward side close to the Rocca al Mare. This was demolished in 1936 while the city was being modernized.The walls were damaged by German aerial bombardment during the Battle of Crete in World War II, but the damage was repaired. After the war, some of the outworks were demolished to make way for modern buildings, and suggestions were also made to demolish the entire city walls. The demolition was never carried out, and the walls remain largely intact, being among the best preserved Venetian fortifications in Europe.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe Venetian fortifications of Heraklion consist of a roughly triangular enceinte. The land front has seven bastions:\n\nSt. Andrew Bastion\nPantocrator Bastion\nBethlehem Bastion\nMartinengo Bastion\nJesus Bastion\nVitturi Bastion\nSampionara BastionCavaliers were built on some of the bastions, and the walls had four main gates and three military gates. The entire enceinte was surrounded by a deep ditch and various outworks, including several ravelins, three hornworks and a crownwork. The Fort of St. Demetrius, consisting of a small bastion and two demi-bastions, was built on the hill to the east of the city.Another enceinte was built along the city's harbour, facing the sea. The harbour entrance was protected by the Koules Fortress (originally known as Rocca al Mare).\nToday, only the Koules Fortress remains of the seaward enceinte. The land front is intact, but the outworks and the Fort of St. Demetrius have been destroyed. Two of the four main gates remain intact.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is also known as Agia Paraskevi cave from the church dedicated to Saint Paraskevi built on top of it. The cave is 160 meters deep and 36 meters wide. The first archaeological examination on the site were carried out by Arthur Evans, the well-known British archaeologist who unearthed and partially restored Knossos in the early 20th century. A more comprehensive exploration was carried out by French and Greek archaeologists in the 1960s. They found a considerable number of bronze and ceramic votive offerings, the oldest of them dating from the earliest Minoan periods, suggesting the cave was an important sacred shrine dedicated to a female fertility deity, presumably Britomartis. The cave was still used in Classical Greek and Roman eras, when the fertility goddess Artemis or her Roman equivalent Diana replaced the Minoan deity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFisher, John and Garvey, Geoff (2007).

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "Knossos (also Cnossos, both pronounced ; Greek: \u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, Kn\u014ds\u00f3s [kno\u02c8sos]; Linear B: Ko-no-so) is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city.Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete. The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1,380\u20131,100 BC. The reason why is unknown, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.\nIn the First Palace Period (around 2,000 BC), the urban area reached a size of as many as 18,000 people. In its peak, the palace and surrounding city boasted a population of 100,000 people shortly after 1,700 BC.\n\n\n== Spelling ==\nThe name Knossos was formerly Latinized as Cnossus or Cnossos, and occasionally Knossus, Gnossus, or Gnossos but is now almost always written Knossos.\n\n\n== Neolithic period ==\nThe site of Knossos has had a very long history of human habitation, beginning with the founding of the first Neolithic settlement (c. 7,000 BC). Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses, and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.Arthur Evans, who unearthed the palace of Knossos in modern times, estimated that c. 8,000 BC a Neolithic people arrived at the hill, probably from overseas by boat, and placed the first of a succession of wattle and daub villages (modern radiocarbon dates have raised the estimate to c. 7,000\u20136,500 BC). Large numbers of clay and stone incised spools and whorls attest to local cloth-making. There are fine ground axe and mace heads of colored stone: greenstone, serpentine, diorite and jadeite, as well as obsidian knives and arrowheads along with the cores from which they were flaked. Most significant among the other small items were a large number of animal and human figurines, including nude sitting or standing females with exaggerated breasts and buttocks. Evans attributed them to the worship of the Neolithic mother goddess and figurines in general to religion.\n\nAmong the items found in Knossos is a Minoan depiction of a goddess flanked by two lionesses that shows a goddess who appears in many other images.\nJohn Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic. In the Aceramic Neolithic, 7,000\u20136,000 BC, a hamlet of 25\u201350 persons existed at the location of the Central Court. They lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of exogamy, living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\nIn the Early Neolithic (6,000\u20135,000 BC), a village of 200\u2013600 persons occupied most of the area of the palace and the slopes to the north and west. They lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on socles of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the center of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered 50 m2 (540 sq ft). The walls were at right angles. The door was centered. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.\nThe settlement of the Middle Neolithic (5,000\u20134,000 BC), housed 500\u20131000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the center of the main room, and pilasters and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a 100 m2 (1,100 sq ft) area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second story was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the Late or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4,000\u20133,000 BC), the population increased dramatically.\n\n\n== Minoan period ==\n\nIt is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after c. 2,000 BC, in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including Mallia, Phaestos and Zakro. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at Ugarit on the Syrian coast and Mari on the upper Euphrates.The early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before c. 1,700, almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By c. 1,650, they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces (c. 1,650\u2013c. 1,450) marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.The palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the pithoi that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system. A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.Building techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.The prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade. Herodotus wrote that Minos, the legendary king of Knossos, established a thalassocracy (sea empire). Thucydides accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands. Archaeological evidence supports the tradition because Minoan pottery is widespread, having been found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.This also applies to the mainland, because both tradition and archaeology indicate strong links between Crete and Athens. The main legend here is the Minotaur story wherein Athens was subject to Knossos and paying tribute. The legend concerns a creature living in a labyrinth who was half-man and half-bull. Bulls are frequently featured on pottery and frescoes found at Knossos, where the intricate layout of the palace might suggest a labyrinth. One of the most common cult-symbols, often seen on palace walls, is the double-headed axe called the labrys, which is a Carian word for that type of tool or weapon.At the height of Cretan power around 1,450 BC, the palaces at Mallia, Phaestus, and Zakro were destroyed along with smaller settlements elsewhere. Only Knossos remained and it survived until c. 1,370. At the time of its destruction, it was occupied by Greeks, whose presence is suggested by a new emphasis on weapons and warfare in both art and burial. Mycenaean-style chamber tombs had been adopted and there was mainland influence on pottery styles. Confirmation came in written form after Michael Ventris deciphered the Linear B tablets and showed the language to be an early form of Greek that was quite unlike the earlier Linear A. Sir Arthur Evans found the Linear B tablets at Knossos and, although the writing was different from the Linear A ones at Phaestus and elsewhere, he thought they were a development of the first and so called them Linear B.Despite speculation that Knossos was destroyed by the volcanic eruption on Santorini, it is generally accepted that the cause was human violence following an invasion of Crete by Greeks from the Argolid, most probably Mycenaean. Knossos was still prosperous at the time of its destruction c. 1,370 with trade and art continuing to thrive. Explanations for its destruction are speculative, but a likely reason is that the Mycenaeans, now prospering on the mainland, decided to remove a rival power.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nIn Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had Daedalus construct a labyrinth, a very large maze (by some connected with the double-bladed axe, or labrys) in which to retain his son, the Minotaur. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen Ariadne. The name \"Knossos\" was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.\nAs far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos' discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins \"labyrinthine\". Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father is an ancient Greek king named Aegeus, the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth \u2013 a building like a maze \u2013 by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.\nAs it turns out, there probably was an association of the word labyrinth, whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the Mycenaean world as an apotropaic mark: its presence on an object would prevent it from being \"killed\". Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the Aegean. And finally, it appears in Linear B on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, Daburinthoio potniai, \"to the mistress of the Labyrinth,\" recording the distribution of one jar of honey. A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.\n\n\n== Hellenistic and Roman period ==\nFieldwork in 2015 revealed that during the early Iron Age, Knossos was rich in imports and was nearly three times larger than indicated by earlier excavations. Whilst archaeologists had previously believed that the city had declined in the wake of a socio-political collapse around 1,200 BC, the work found instead, that the city had prospered, with its final abandonment coming later.After the fall of the Minoans, Knossus was repopulated approximately 1,000 BC and it remained one of the most important centers of Crete. The city had two ports: Amnisos and Heraklion. According to the ancient geographer Strabo the Knossians colonized the city of Brundisium in Italy. In 343 BC, Knossos was allied with Philip II of Macedon. The city employed a Phocian mercenary named Phalaikos against their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who sent their king Archidamus III against the Knossians. In Hellenistic times Knossos came under Egyptian influence, but despite considerable military efforts during the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC), the Ptolemies were not able to unify the warring city states. In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the Lyttian War in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the Polyrrhenians and the Macedonian king Philip V.Twenty years later, during the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), the Knossians were once more among Philip's opponents and, through Roman and Rhodian aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence. With Roman aid, Knossus became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose Gortys as the capital of the newly created province Creta et Cyrene. In 36 BC, Knossus became a Roman colony named Colonia Iulia Nobilis. The colony, which was built using Roman-style architecture, was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.\nThe identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation 85 m (279 ft) from current sea level. Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse. The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala. The Romans believed they were the first to colonize Knossos.In Christian times, Knossos became a titular see, but during the ninth century AD the local population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion). By the thirteenth century, it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall'; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves bishops of Knossos until the nineteenth century. Today, the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.\n\n\n== Discovery and modern history of the antiquities ==\n\nThe site of Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos. The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941) and his team, and continued for 35 years. Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B, to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present. From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.\nSince their discovery, the ruins have undergone a history of their own, from excavation by renowned archaeologists, education, and tourism, to occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars. This site history is to be distinguished from the ancient.\n\n\n== Palace complex ==\nThe features of the palace depend on the time period. Currently visible is an accumulation of features over several centuries, the latest most dominant. Thus, the palace was never exactly as depicted today. In addition, it has been reconstituted in modern materials. The custom began in an effort to preserve the site from decay and torrential winter rain. After 1922, the chief proprietor, Arthur Evans, intended to recreate a facsimile based on archaeological evidence. The palace is not exactly as it ever was, perhaps in places, not even close, and yet in general, judging from the work put in and the care taken, as well as parallels with other palaces, it probably is a good general facsimile. Opinions range, however, from most skeptical, viewing the palace as pure fantasy based on 1920s architecture and art deco, to most unquestioning, accepting the final judgements of Arthur Evans as most accurate. The mainstream of opinion falls between.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, the terms \"Knossos\" and \"palace\" are somewhat ambiguous. The palace was never just the residence of a monarch, although it contained rooms that might have been suitable for a royal family. Most of the structures, however, were designed to serve a civic, religious, and economic center. The term palace complex is more accurate. In ancient times, Knossos was a town surrounding and including the Kephala. This hill was never an acropolis in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground. These circumstances cannot necessarily be imputed to other Minoan palaces. Phaistos, contemporaneous with Knossos, was placed on a steep ridge, controlling access to the Messara Plain from the sea, and was walled. To what degree Minoan civilization might be considered warlike remains debatable. It can, however, be said that Knossos bore no resemblance to a Mycenaean citadel, whether before or during Mycenaean Greek occupation.The complex was constructed ultimately around a raised central court on the top of Kephala. The previous structures were razed and the top was made level to make way for the court. The court is oblong, with the long axis, which points north-northeast, generally described as pointing \"north\". Plot plans typically show the court with the long axis horizontal, apparently east-west with the north on the right, or vertical with the north on the top. Either arrangement is confusing unless the compass points are carefully marked. About 5 km (3.1 mi) to the north of the palace complex is the sea at the Port of Heraklion. Directly to the south is Vlychia Stream, an east-west tributary of the north-south Kairatos. Kephala is an isolated hill at the confluence.The Kairatos River reaches the sea between the modern port of Heraklion and Heraklion Airport to the east. In ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate. Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.The archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.The Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.\n\n\n=== General features ===\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, Late Minoan. The palace has an interesting layout  \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The 6 acres (24,000 m2) of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers (pithoi) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n\n=== Water management ===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\nAqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs there are the source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at Mycenae.\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained an example of the first known water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a floor drain or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n\nRunoff system. Sloped channels lead from a catchment basin.\nRunoff system. Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.\n\n\n=== Minoan columns ===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height (entasis), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.\n\n\n=== Pottery ===\n\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n\n=== Frescoes ===\n\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed fresco panel murals, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground hematite. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh stucco with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.The decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: humans, legendary creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.\n\n\n=== Throne room ===\n\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called Throne Room or Little Throne Room, dated to LM II. This chamber has an alabaster seat identified by Evans as a \"throne\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a lustral basin, which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on seal rings, which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n\nThe seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"heraldic arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the Mycenaeans would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\nA room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess, who would have sat in the throne, either in effigy, or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of divinity rather than a heraldic motif.Additional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\nA long-standing debate between archaeologists concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a theocratic manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of Bronze Age Crete, and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the Mycenaeans, although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAenesidemus (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\nChersiphron (sixth century BC) architect\nEpimenides (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\nErgoteles of Himera (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\nMetagenes (6th century BC) architect\nMinos (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagasa\nTrapeza\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwindale, Ian. \"Minoan Crete website: Knossos Pages\".\n\"Knossos\".

          "This site has an an amazing history and worth a visit for anyone interested in Greek mythology as it is associated with the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur. But don't expect to see any labyrinth much less a minotaur! The palace is partially reconstructed to its presumed",
          "The palace represents a very ancient pre-greek civilization which remains mysterious. Some believe it is the basis of the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur. Although the reconstruction has benn criticized, it is still a hod experience, somewhat eerie. It is a few miles out of",
          "Love this place. I have been there 7-8 times. A place with huge history. For sure you need more than 40 minutes to see with details the whole museum.",
          "It is so easy to get to Knossos from Heraklion City Center. I just took the city bus for less than 2 Euro. It takes less than half a day to explore, but it is so interesting that I would've gladly given more time to it than I did. Beautiful place. Loved it.",
          "The Palace of Knossos is one of these places you MUST visit. It is definitely worth hiring a guide or visiting it with in a guided tour. Besides the beautiful ruins and the part that has been reconstructed - regardless of the materials used - the history behind it is \"amazing\".",
          "A real look way back in history. A lot of information boards around. By far the visitors where guided tours. Take a hat if going in summer its very hot and there is nowhere to hide and it gets very busy",
          "My husband and I spent a few hours in Knossos, first eating at a taverna across the street from the entrance (the only restaurant there or at last open except for the cafe inside the park which also seemed okay but the taverna was crowded with locals which we enjoyed) and had a",
          "Expectations were very high and we were left disappointed. We were early, but the line was huge - we did avoid the que with online tickets, but it was crowded. I also understand why there are critics of Sir Arthur Evans - his vision might have been great, but it is impossible",
          "Birthplace of Minoan civilization uncovered. Many rooms that should be done by guided tour for best understanding",
          "It may be that we have seen a lot of other historic sites that Knossos left us underwhelmed. Having queued to get in and paid what we thought was overpriced the actual site was a bit of a let down . It seems to be reconstructed by the discoverer in a style reminiscent of Disney",
          "The site was very nice but we were taken advantage of by a tour guide. The private guide outside offered her services for $100, then $80, then $60 and when I declined she said there was a group tour instead for $10 per person When we joined the group inside the guide insisted",
          "The shear age of this place is fascinating....thinking about how long ago this place was built and inhabited is incredible. This may be the oldest civilization in Europe if estimates are correct. The self-paced tour was our choice so we got to walk around at our own leisure. I",
          "Take the time to visit this site. It was recommended to us and we engaged the services of a guide, which was well worth the modest expense. The palace has a fascinating history and our guide was knowledgeable. We subsequently visited the Heraklion Archeological Museum, and",
          "Visiting Crete had been on my bucket list for a while as I was fascinated by its long steep history with the Minoan civilisation and culture. Finally, made it here to the beautiful island, and I stayed at Heraklion, near the Old Port. Our hotel is situated close by to the Old",
          "A fantastic half day visit for us and our 2.5 year old boy. Easily accessible by bus from Heraklion. Reasonableness accessible with buggy but not there are some stairs. Beautiful and plenty of space to entertain a toddler.",
          "As it was off season not so busy so got around the sight fairly quickly. Very knowledgeable guide so enjoyed it.",
          "We took the city bus here, bought the ticket on location, and used an audio tour (cliomuse) to guide ourselves. Simple. The ruins themselves are worth the visit, if you aren't too picky. It is difficult to tell where the ruins are original, and where they have been recreated.",
          "I have visited historical and archaeological sites in many countries, and I have never seen one as horribly destroyed as this. The site, which is probably uniquely valuable in being the focus of one of the greatest European civilzations - the Minoan, has been \"reconstructed\"",
          "Very interesting ruins, worth a visit if you have the time. We didn't have a guide because we had been to so many ruins on our trip already but a guide would probably help bring the place to life.",
          "We always enjoy visiting historic sights - we enjoyed doing this. Easy accessible on the bus from Hersonissos where we were staying. Some interesting things to see here. Some difficult bits under foot so maybe appropriate foot wear and not flip flops as I did!!",
          "led by The AMAZING \"STELLINA\" ( a very funny and sweet and experienced woman half italian and half Stars-made ) we discovered the ruins and the magic of the Knossos Palace with his Fascinations, Magic, legends , Under a VERY burning SUN, IT WAS AUGUST IT WAS a special moment...",
          "I consider the Palace confusing because it was difficult at times to determine what were ruins and what was recreated. Some of that is on us as we did not invest in a tour guide, but instead bought a book to direct us around. It is amazing to wander around the ruins though",
          "Having been to Mycenae, Delphi and Olympia within the last 18 months, this is as interesting as any, especially the unexpected parts. Get there early: guides in major languages are easy to find",
          "Interesting archaeological site. You'll need to use your imagination a little bit to get the full picture but still lots of great stuff to be soon.",
          "The Palace of Knossos in Crete is a must-see! It\u2019s only 15 minutes or so outside of Heraklion city-center. You can get a bus ticket or take a 15\u20ac taxi to get there. There\u2019s guides speaking a variety of languages available right at the gate, but honestly a guide is not necessary",
          "Great historical palace of Minoins, very interesting. Loved seeing the built in toilets and drainage systems among all the art work! Beautiful",
          "WeGuide Crete was a terrific company to work with for our tour of Knossos and a bonus free walking tour of Heraklion. Both tour guides were fantastic and very knowledgable. The Knossos tour really gave us a great picture of life during the Minoan period and our guide was able",
          "My husband and I visited during the October half term so it wasn't very busy. We toured by ourself using a tour book. The site itself is quite vast and if you went to everything you could easily spend 3 or so hours there but we felt we has seen as much as we wanted in about 1",
          "We visited the palace as part of a day trip organised by Sparrow Travel. The combined ticket for the National Museum in Heraklion and Knossos was worth it at \u20ac16 per adult and free for children. I used my guidebook (Lonely Planet:Crete) to take us round as the provided guide",
          "Without our guide Maria it would have been very hard to get all the infos. The prices for guided tours seemed fair 10 \u20ac each person.",
          "The history of the palace is interesting and learning from a guide makes the experience worthwhile. Word of caution, DO NOT BOOK A TRANSFER through VIATOR from your hotel to the Palace. We had a misunderstanding with the transfer company and had to cancel our tour because they",
          "Wow, talk about amazing history. This is well laid out and easy to walk around. I was in awe of the history and impressed by all it had to offer. Try and avoid times when tours go through as big groups hover around areas and it makes it difficult to see and read the details. We",
          "Great opportunity to see and touch ancient history but spoiled by too many visitors. There are other sites that offer as much but are almost empty",
          "Amazing spectacle in Konossus. Great day out with the family. If driving please use the convenient and free car park next door. The people are very friendly and helpful. Even the restaurant next to the attraction is reasonably priced.",
          "Well worth a visit but be prepared it can be very busy. Larger area than expected and would be worth getting a guide to fully understand.",
          "We had a guide who made us appreciate the ingenuity of these early peoples The site is only 5% excavated, but it was actually a huge city with modern conveniences such a a sewer system.",
          "Having visited the Minoan Palace, Malia and been left with a thousand years of questions I visited Knossos with an open mind. I liked that there was more information which of course gives a better understanding of the site, which is large and although it does get very hot there",
          "One of the most famous and important archeological sites in the world. There's a lot of 'imagination' gone into the 'reconstruction' of parts of this complex but the fact that the people here had three systems of water treatment when the Ancient Britons were living in caves",
          "Very interesting to see the layout and structures from ancient times. Access can be difficult as paths ant stairways are not the best maintained and handrails are not that secure",
          "The Ruins of Knossos are something interesting to see in Cretan history. But in general it is overrated. if you are In Heraklion Then that\u2019s fine but as we traveled 160km it was not worth it.",
          "The guides there cost 10\u20ac per person and they wait for a group 10 people or you can get a private tour for 100 \u20ac I noticed English, German and French guides looking for people to give tours to when we visited. They wait outside the entrance till they have enough people. There",
          "Great place to visit. We did a trip with Jet2 and thoroughly enjoyed it, our guide, Gregory, was very informative. We spent the morning at Knossos and then on to Heraklion where we had free time for a walk around before going into the museum. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get long",
          "Ancient ruins with some relatively new constructions on top of it. Not great with children who get easily board. A good thing about it: there\u2019s a free car park area.",
          "Maybe not for little children, they might find it boring. Get a guide, it is better. Not a lot to see though. It's just rocks.",
          "Loved going around this site and seeing the Mycenaean village. It has great vistas of the island as you walk around the area",
          "We took a taxi from Heraklion that cost EUR8 and only took 10 minutes. We caught the bus back and cost EUR5 for both of us and took 15 minutes. This is a huge place and you could spend hours here. In the restoration process, they\u2019ve taken a few extra steps trying to recreate how",
          "Last visited about 28 years ago in the heat of August. Visited today and temperatures were very pleasant. The site seems very well preserved even the reconstructions. Very clean but the visit was spoiled a little by tour guides and their parties blocking bridges and paths. The",
          "We enjoyed the visit to this historic sight. It is well signposted and the explanatory signboards are instructive. There is a lot to see so it takes several hours if you want to fully appreciate it. It was crowded in October so in peak season it must be much more difficult to",
          "Knossos is wonderful and totally worth it but be prepared to fight the crowds unless you get there early. It's worth hurrying to get there before the buses arrive!! The restorations help to give it a real life feel. Be sure to see the amazing display in the archaeological",
          "Really nice visit. We got there early, got a parking spot, also got in fast. All was as expected. A lot of rocks. I would've liked some more pictures of reconstructions. I had a Lonely Planet travel guide and it helped a bit, but still was hard to imagine all the things by",
          "We done this as an excursion on our tui holiday. It was great to look around but the tour went on abit long and got boring. My children got bored quickly and it wasn\u2019t very pushchair friendly",
          "We went out of our way to go there and having enjoyed places like Pompeii in the past were really looking forward to it. What a massive disappointment. Sections of it have been rebuilt, you could argue its \"restoration\" and they used a fair amount of concrete in the process,",
          "Even in October it\u2019s a hot day out and parking was tricky but free. Take plenty of water and allow lots of time so you can stop in the tiny patches of shade. We went without a guide (human or book) which may have been a set back. It\u2019s a massive site and very difficult to tell",
          "We took the guided tour, which I think have us a much better insight into the palace. The parts of the site that have been reconstructed give a good idea just how well designed, grand & culturally significant the palace and the civilisation which built it.",
          "The sheer scale of the palace is astonishing and, given its ancient history, it is in good shape. I guess those ancient Greeks knew how to build!",
          "A tour guide is a must to have everything explained to you. Very interesting and educational. A trip to the Archaeology museum afterwards paints a clearer picture of what was seen.",
          "Beautiful place, must see, its part of our history. I recommend visit this place from september because is very Hot",
          "Visited the Temple of Knossos in July 2018. It was very hot. Luckily we had bought a combination ticket at the archaeology museum in Heraklion so we avoided the very long queue for tickets.",
          "First stop after arriving in Knossos and buying our entry tickets was a coffee and a fresh orange juice. Wow - 8.50 Euros for 2 drinks! Entry was 15 euros each. The Palace covers quite a big area, with lots of steps up and down, and lots of staff to make sure you don't touch",
          "very interesting but I suggest you visit the Archaeology Museum first to understand who the Minoans were",
          "Very interesting, I suggest you visit the Archaeology Museum first, for some background and to purchase a dual ticket (16 euros against 15 euros for Knossos and 10 for the museum).",
          "Bit of a conflict for archaeology buffs ! but fantastic for lay people wanting to understand who the Minoans were. The archaeologist in the early 1900's rebuilt parts of the palace with concrete to show what it looked like. But it is obvious which is original and which is",
          "We had done our research and knew roughly what to expect. Firstly, some tips: Arrive early even off season. There is a free car park next to the site and was half empty at 10am. At 10am there was no queue in mid October for the Cassa, We are Univerity members and ID card",
          "Its truly a remarkable place, so old with so much history. Gets very busy and guided tours can be a problem. We just got a taxi there (Not organised tour) but everywhere there are information boards to let you know some of the history. Its the second most visited place in Crete",
          "Knossos is a nice and interesting historic place. There is many free parking for cars and bus in front of palace. There is a lot of shops and tavern in front of palace. The walk is pleasant and interesting around the great palace!We are glad that some parts of the palace are",
          "An amazing place to visit, beautiful area. Beautiful surroundings, great information on strategically placed boards, and knowledgeable staff.",
          "We visited the Palace of Knossos while in Heraklion for 1.5 days. It was worth the trip (but not one of the best archaeological sites I've been to). Things I think I did right: 1- Got there by the #2 Bus. it cost 1.70 Euros/person (It's the #20 bus to go back). It took",
          "Even with some knowledge of the history it failed to keep us interested. The reconstruction was necessary but it has taken away the ambiance and impact of the site. Nevertheless we had moments where we could immerse ourselves and imagine we were there 4000 years ago which was",
          "Moving experience to be in the midst of that much history. Fantastic archeological site that makes you feel insignificant in the grand scheme of life",
          "An off peak visit as early as 8am is advised as there are lots of pinch points. Even off peak there were queues to see the more popular places in the palace. I found the amount of concrete off putting, in spite of understanding how and why there was so much. Do wear decent",
          "Fab place. So interesting. However going on a tour with English tourists being the minority meant we had a lot of waiting about to hear what was next. If you can, go earlier in the morning before the coaches arrive. I think it's open from 8am",
          "Interesting place to visit due to the historical and archaeological importance of it. Nothing impressive and the guide prices are a rip off.",
          "This was first palace ever built during they believe during Neolithic area. It\u2019s associated with the dwelling of the Minotaur in Greek mythology called the labyrinth .",
          "As expected, Knossos is amazing, really worth the price ticket, especially when buying the combined ticket with the archeological museum of Heraklion. Really recommend for ancient history nerds like myself",
          "An easy public bus trip and this amaziong ancient palace is your's if you go at opening time. Enjoy and walk around and absorb the ancient history before the crowds. We got there before 9, avoided the heat and the crowds, we were able to explore, and take photos in solitude. By",
          "You cannot visit crete and not go to knososs. Having visited other historic places and cities my expectations were high. Having read about minoan history and the myths about this place and seen many photographs I was quite disappointed on arrival. This continued throughout the",
          "We have been to Knossos a few times and it changes every time we go. It is a fascinating place and really worth seeing. It is so hard to believe that they were so advanced as a race with washing and toilet facilities. You can also go to the Museum in Heraklion to see all the",
          "This has been on my 'to.do' list for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. You need to do this in conjunction with the museum in Heraklion to see all that was found there.",
          "I just have to say I enjoyed the tours I receive through TUI while in Crete. Especially the guide Veta. We had her on a tour of Heraklion, the archeology museum and Knossos and then another day in Elounda, Spinaloga, and St. Nicholaos. She was the BEST guide we have ever had",
          "We went to the Palace of Knossos on two occasions, once with a tour operator tour and once separately. On both occasions, the palace was beautiful. A lot of time and effort has been put into the location to make it as informative and fascinating as possible. From the",
          "Great site to visit - gets very busy and quite a lot of queueing so go early. We took a guide (\u20ac100 shared between 2 couples) - well worth the money as got an excellent historical review. Really enjoyed the site but gets busy. Phaestus is as good as less busy.",
          "But get a guide. We farms a great guide and it was well worth it. I would not want to go without one.",
          "This pile of rocks is mostly made up of replicas that may or may not be historically accurate. Don\u2019t waste your time. If you want to support local tourism then go to the island itself as it\u2019s a beautiful place, but if you want a more historical and engaging experience either",
          "A fascinating archaeological site, Evans did his work well to give an insight into life in Minoan times. We went late in the afternoon, to be recommended as the crowds were thinner and the heat less intensive. Well worth a visit!",
          "If you are a \u201cvisitor of palaces\u201d don\u2019t expect to see a place at Knossos. There is a series of ruins and a lot of walking on uneven surfaces. There are a few surviving friezes but this is 4000 years old so don\u2019t think of it as a Cretan Versailles. However on entering you are",
          "My husband and I visited in September which was still very hot. Although it is amazing to see how the palace might have looked most of the site was reconstructed by a British archeologist which is disappointing. However still worth going to. We also saw a beautiful peacock",
          "It's a wonderful place by itself, but I really recommend to have the guide here. We had a wonderful guide, who was passionate about the whole story and the visit was really unforgettable. In combination to the Palace of Knossos I recommend to visit Archaeological museum in",
          "What is there to review ..Amazing but be sure to go to the Museum in Heraklion later to see the artifacts associated with the site..",
          "Eight of us took the open bus that drops you off right in the parking lot so you don't have to walk too far. Get there early and purchase your ticket there. We decided to get their tour guide and certainly glad we did. If we didn't I would have the same reaction as the other",
          "You don\u2019t need my opinion on this historical site but I will leave you some tips. Don\u2019t buy tickets in advance the line goes quickly. If you can...buy the combined ticket and do the palace first then the museum\u2014 the museum will enhance your palace experience and put it kind of",
          "Very very crowded with groups standing around listening to their guides blocking the small walkways and route. Lots of rubble with small areas reconstituted to give you a feel of the place but it just didn\u2019t do it for me. Visit the museum instead as you\u2019ll get more out of it.",
          "Yes this is an important historical site. BUT. Crowded to the hilt with crocodiles of tourist bus groups blindly following their leader.Sadly the reconstruction or 'interpretation' has been undertaken in reinforced concrete which looks just plain wrong.Get a guide book first",
          "Definitely worth a visit being a live archaeological dig. Wear suitable footwear as the paths are uneven.",
          "I realize that most reviews are positive for this site but I will have to disagree. The place is super crowded with tour buses in a relatively small archeological site. I felt like a salmon swimming upstream. Most of the site is not much more than rubble and the few things that",
          "If you ask at the entrance they will tell you can enter and easily go around with a stroller. It is not completely true. Most of the rooms are not accessible. So I wouldn't recommend it to small children. Site is amazing and there is lot to discover. But you will have to use",
          "It is quite a large site. Wear a hat. If over 65 you get in for half price if you have id. Take a drink with you.",
          "Don't get me wrong this place is worth visiting if you are in the area but in terms of archaeological importance in world wide, let alone European, significance there are more interesting and better things to see. However, the Museum of Archaeology in nearby Heraklion is well",
          "I felt like we could have done this in a lot less time. I've toured many sites in Egypt and was slightly disappointed that most of what you saw here was re-created, but necessary, as the original burned a few times (and was made largely of wood). Strongly recommend a quick (1",
          "If you come to Crete by ferry or plane you'll most likely begin your journey in Heraklion. Not to be missed, the Palace of Knossos and the Heraklion Archaeology Museum (visit them both in that order) are fascinating, interesting and incredible. You will learn all about the",
          "For us 30\u00b0 for this attraction was super hot. It is essential to get tour-you will understand more,otherwise is is just ruins and some other things. The history of the place is amazing and it should be a nr. 1 place to go in Crete.",
          "It's a great place, with old history, very old. It's easy access, great view. Be early, before all busses will come. It gets really busy. And hard to get good photos, and to enjoy this place, when it gets crowded. So go early, and it will be great. If you like history, it's a",
          "What an amazing experience to see how people lived so many years ago. A truly wonderful experience would recommend to people of all age groups",
          "Visited at about 2pm after the coach parties had gone and before the cruise liner guests arrived. Decided to hire a guide - best thing we could have done as a guide gives much more colour and information to the tour. Well worth it. Fascinating how the Legend of the Labyrinth",
          "Knossos is a very important site archaeologically and historically, a main centre of Minoan culture. It is large with same extensive remains. It is worth visiting for these reasons. That said, compared with similar archaeological sites, it has major drawbacks which greatly",
          "A great place to visit. Very interesting. We were lucky to avoid the coach tours as I imagine it would be extremely busy in high season. 50c to use the ladies toilet ! Concessionary rates for over 65s if you produce ID. We used our driving licenses.",
          "A very nice site with some restoration to encourage your imagination as to the past greatness of the past. The site is easy to find and access. Plenty of parking if you are driving. I personally like the restoration that has been done. There is also a very beautiful view of the",
          "We were lucky to arrive in early afternoon after the crowds had cleared out which made it very easy to walk around. It was much more extensive than I thought and the restorations were done in a way to keep the history alive. Certainly makes one very humbled by their engineering",
          "This is of course a five star attraction, but just to make a point of the conservation and presentation: Four points in stead of five. The Palace of Knossos is extremely interesting and shoud not be missed. If you visit Crete and have the least chance to go to Knossos: You",
          "I came to here with a couple of friends. We thought we could google the facts and follow the map ourselves and read the plaques ourselves. But the site is large and the buildings are at least 50% rubble, therefore I recommend paying for a guide. It will give you history, fun",
          "Well worth a visit for anyone interested in Greek history. It is huge and beautiful and incredibly clever. It is just an amazing place and if you are not happy going around by yourself then there are tour guides available. We quite happily meandered for a few hrs without",
          "Amazing place if you like history.we didn't have much time but managed a good short visit of 2 hours. Best go early at opening time 0800 to avoid queues either getting tickets or getting in.also you can then avoid large tour groups. By doing this you should be able to have",
          "I am definitely a fan of Greek antiquity and this might be my 4th or 5th trip here over 40 years. It never disappoints. Each time I brought with me people who were unfamiliar with the history but left an appreciator. I always hire a licensed guide at the site and learn more each",
          "If you are a litle bit interested of a Greek history, that is a must see. You need 2-3 hours time, a botle of watter and a shield hat, And if you go in the morning, there are not so many people.",
          "We visited Knossos palace on 6th September 2019 as part of our holiday to Crete and we were not disappointed! The ruins have been wonderfully restored and well kept, however we found that it takes roughly 3hrs+ or ideally a half day to see and appreciate the Palace. As with",
          "Unless you\u2019re a real fan of boring archeological digs, skip this one! Much of it\u2019s reconstruction is the vision of one man & not entirely based on facts. There is very little to see & the price was 15 Euros. It took us about 30 min. to see the whole thing. Had tour guides",
          "Went 23 September 2019 from malia bus to heraclion 4 euros 10 then bus to knosos 5 euros return then 30 euros to get in without guide total rip off for what's on offer lots of guided tours holding everyone up in the baking sun all looking bored to death .most of the buildings",
          "Cannot got to Crete and go to some of the historic sites. This was 30 minute drive from our hotel. Went fairly early in the morning to beat the crowds and the heat. There were guided tours but we were happy to wander about and take in the atmosphere. It was a little",
          "Not authentic; poorly marked and explained; overpriced for the experience. Sorry we wasted our precious vacation time there!",
          "Try to get there as they open but there is still lots of people. It\u2019s a place you have to see but found Phaistos to be more interesting due to the lack of people and it\u2019s in its original condition at the time of discovery.",
          "Having read reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to get up early and head off to Knossos in order to avoid queuing to get in. We arrived just before 9am and went straight through to the ticket booth - no waiting. Spent 2 hours or so wandering round the ruins and reading the",
          "The information boards basically said Evans thought.... Some people dont... And nobody really knows. Some more research is needed to understand it all more. Otherwise its just a bunch of old walls and some wishful thinking of an English imperialist.",
          "We traveled by city bus for 2.5 euros each to Knossos. It was 20-25 minutes and very easy. Yesterday, we had visited Archeological Museum in Heraklion to get the context and history of Knossos. The Palace site inspired one to imagine life thousands of years back. My favorite was",

          "This place is packed 24/7 so I recommend getting there early to beat the cruise line crowds. It\u2019s also hot during Summer (scorching hot) and rocky and dusty and hot. So my recommendation is to wear comfortable shoes like sneakers, take water, pack on sunscreen and wear a hat.",
          "Amazing for those interested in Grecian mythology. I would recommend hiring a tour guide. Take the local bus from Heraklion to get there.",
          "To start things off and I can not stress this enough, get a guide in your native language (or generally English), as it\u2019s a whole different experience all-together. The guide stops with the group (no more than 10 no less than 8) at the sweet spots in the shade and details the",
          "10 euro per person for a guided tour that lasted a bit over one hour. It was absolutely disappointing and a waste of money. This might reflect our tour guide only. English speaking tour, no outline or overview on history, inappropriate comments and statements, and a child could",
          "Knowing quite a lot about the story of King Minos of Crete we were keen to see the palace at Knossos. We got there easily on the bus from Heraklion port. Our first shock was the price. At \u20ac15 it is the most expensive of the archeological sites we\u2019ve seen. Once inside we were",
          "This is a must see - excavated Minoan structure. However, it leaves a whole lot to imagination as there are no explanations at all ! In this day and age it would not be a great task to put up a few artists recreation of what it could have been in those days. Could not keep",
          "Traveled for over an hour to get to Knossos, should have checked the entry fee first. It\u2019s 15 euros each and not worth it at all. No information, cheap concrete reconstruction and hoards of people means long, long queues. Go to Phiatos instead, or Malia Palace they are much",
          "Rich history, much of the original palace in tack, you get a good view of how the Minoans constructed and engineered what is now an historical and architectural marvel.",
          "While it seems inconceivable not to pay a visit to the site, it was somewhat disappointing: explanations are limited and not very clear; many parts are badly restored with concrete and mural paintings are not original, (the real ones are in the Archeologic Museum in Hierakio).",
          "Worth the visit if you are into Greek history. Some signs explaining what structures are but not very clear. Long lines before noon, in shaded area. Very little shade inside the site. Brink hat and water.",
          "We visited here in mid-July and joined a guided tour led by a lady called Stella (Styla?). The whole experience was a positive one - as the crowds weren\u2019t anywhere near what I was expecting and our guide paced our trip really well and ensured she found us shaded spots before she",
          "I\u2019m a huge fan of history, and Ancient Greece and myths in particular, so visiting Knossos was a must. Sadly no Minotaur there when we visited, but the ruins were pretty cool. The place was pretty crowded and the sun was very hot indeed. We spent less than an hour, I guess",

          "Unless you are into the Mionian civilization or you are in or about Heraklion and have a couple of hours to kill, I would not recommend this. There are not many structures left and mostly it is in ruins, compared to what you will see in the Acrolopis. We hired a tour guide,",
          "A must if you are in Crete. Large free carpark at the site but local cafes also have carparks for free. Large site - Highly recommend getting a guide (\u20ac10 each) as you will learn so much more then looking around on your own. Guides are usually stood by the entrance (they also",

          "Generally a place with great potential, but underdeveloped from archeological and tourist point of view. Thus quite pricey - \u20ac15 entry fee. Unfortunately it is looked upon as a golden mine with no investment intention, which is pitty. Almost 0 tables and organization on site. I",
          "In retrospect it would be best to see Phaisos first which is quite atmospheric. Then here at Knossos which is ok and then go for the finale to the archeological museum in Heraklion. The museum is so clearly the big attraction full of artefacts and so well described Knossos is",
          "I know a lot of people bemoan the fact some of the site has been reconstructed to give the visitors a better idea of what this palace site would have felt like, but for me I liked that this had been done as it added to the feel of the place. After all there are countless other",
          "As soon as we arrived at the entrance we were approached by a sales team offering guided tours in English. There were 7 in our party (3 adults and 4 students) and the guide offered us a deal of 50 euros instead of 100 euros. I had read on the website that EU students could gain",
          "Decided not to visit the site by coach and made our own way by car. Plenty of parking available in the palace car park and at the open air restaurant nearby(good food served). We do like looking around historical sites but have to say that the palace is overrated and overpriced.",
          "Very historical but when it was excavated unfortunately they tried to save and recreate parts with a lot of concrete. Also rather expensive and not really worth it. free car park next door and the taverna we went in was very good opposite the site.",
          "Best ruins in the island. Some of the parts are rebuilded but this is the most iconic place and a must go site. Try to visit it early in the morning or late in the evening (18:00) because in sumer its really hot. The parking is free and you have to thing that the visit will",
          "A tourist spot par excellence. This special and historical so important place is crowded and loud. The huge complex is buried under thousand of tourists.",
          "I would only suggest going here if you have nothing better to do. 15 euros (8 for 65+) so quite expensive, and in my opinion not worth it. No information leaflet, guidebook or audio guide - just information boards that at times you had to queue up to read. Frankly not that",
          "As many suggested, we went to the museum first before touring the archeological site. The museum truly impressed us with the grandeur of the Minoan civilization. You will be glad you saw and read about the artifacts found at the site first, because it makes touring Knossos so",
          "If you know the story and the history then you can get around the site yourself in about 90 minutes but if you don't, then it's best to take a guide. The guide station is at the entrance before the ticket sales which is a bit odd, so you should sort this out before you buy the",
          "Having been to Rome & Sorrento recently both of which have more than their fair share of fantastic archeological sites, The Palace of Knossos is left wanting. It seems like the restoration isn\u2019t being done very carefully. Having said that I\u2019m no archeology boffin so maybe I\u2019m",
          "I'll be the first to admit that I'm not really interested in history of these archaeological sites but enjoy having a look round and seeing how things were built and the way they lived, at the major sites information is there to tell you a little about it. We arrived here",
          "I like this place. Knossos is exciting and impressive in its size. It's the second time we visited the site, first time on a guided tour this time on our own, and how much more one gets from an 'unguided' tour, just the book in one hand and the water in the other. One can really",
          "It certainly was an interesting place to visit, one which I\u2019ve been very interested in for a long time, however when you go and get a guide, check them out first. We had a very blunt and rude guide who for unknown reasons was just so short and rude to me. Others in our group",
          "The ruins are interesting but the views are breathtaking, lovely to sit and contemplate. A worthwhile visit!",
          "Had a guided tour from our holiday company the guide was very informative, the ruins was very interesting, wear good shoes as very uneven. It cost \u00a316 each which included entrance to museum in Heraklion, was a bit expensive they should charge less and instead of under 18 being",

          "My wife and I visited the achaelogical area of Knossos on a Tui trip - it was very good but quite a tiring trip especially as it was so hot on the day of the visit (35 deg C) and there is little shade. You should wear a hat and carry enough water for a 2 hour visit. The site has",
          "I already knew the story of Knossos & Arthur Evans\u2019 questionable (to put it mildly) excavation & recreation. 95% of the things here are fake & I call it archeology Disney Land because he used reinforced concrete & paint to try and make the site look the way he thought it should.",
          "It\u2019s hard to say just how accurate is this representation of the actual palace. But the archaeologist used the materials on site and his experiences to refabricate the area. Pretty interesting if you ask me.",
          "Overcrowded. Guides try to intercept you before you can walk to the ticket office. The woman at the ticket office was super unfriendly. We had official transcripts that we were all students, and only one friend of us had the student card with her. The woman only allowed the free",
          "After 10 weeks in Greece, we are over ruins, but saying that we actually enjoyed this site, for better than Olympia. Whilst they are ruins there a noumerous part buildings that give you a good Insite into what a magnificent palace this once was. Entry fee 15 euro pp. In",

          "As much as I love the history of this place, the ruins are just not so impressive because it is so hard to tell what is remade and what isn't. Concrete is dominant there. It is a place worth seeing though, but I feel it has been tampered with too much to feel like an ancient",
          "We had an excellent guide who knew the site well, she gave us a real insight into the minoan civilization through her tour and talk. Well worth the entry price. We had a joint Knossos/Archeology museum ticket which was excellent value. Sadly the toilet facilities were inadequate",
          "As our guide told us, people here had a sewage system and air conditioned about 4000 years ago - what more could you say about it. Even if it was extremely warm, the visit is a refreshing one as there are some areas with shadow and with its own ventilation system.",
          "An iconic place to visit if you are in Crete. We took a 1 hour and 30 min visit with an italian guide than explained all about the palace, the way they lived and worked. Suggest to take a licensed guide for the visit. We paid 16 eur for 1 ticket that included the museum in",
          "We took up an offer of a guide and so glad we did! Eva, our guide was so informative and helpful. Full of knowledge and eager to pass it on! Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have learnt half as much! Knossos was amazing!",
          "Go! it is really great. We went about 5 pm and had a guided tour for 10 euros each - (organise the tour outside the entrance) there were four of us and we joined with two others. European Union Students free entry - take Student ID card. Very informative guide and you feel",
          "What a privilege to be able to walk in King Minos\u2019 footsteps and to get a feel for the place where his people\u2019s impressive civilisation had its heart.

          "1st, don't buy a map at the gift shop and think it will help. It is pretty and for a souvenir, not to help navigate the sight much. Now, before you go, download the app izi.travel and purchase the \"Knossos Palace: the Labyrinth of the Minotaur.\" it costs about $2 and you can",
          "Knossos is the most famous archaeological site in Crete. A short drive from Heraklion and worth visiting. We opted not to get a tour guide. Probably worth getting one, though the signage is good. And our guide book provided guidance. The original sculptures and antiquities are",

          "The English guide we had was absolutely horrible. She was rude, uninformative, and just obnoxious. She would yell at people to get out of the way for us even though they were standing there first. She didnt tell us anything usefull or interesting about the site, she just rambled",
          "This huge minoan palace has been reconstructed in many parts, so you get a good idea of what the arqeoligist Evan's thought it used to look like.Its a good idea to visit the arqeological museum in Heraklion first,as many original features such as murals were moved there .There",
          "This was the least impressive archeological site we visited on our trip. It was the most expensive site we visited and was the least impressive. It was crowded, lines were long, lots of large tour groups. Would not rush to this site.",
          "A must when you are in Crete, I've been here 8-10 times, I'm equally impressed every time. First time, it can be a good investment to take a guide (which is good)",
          "The Knossos Palace is a wonderful historical site of the Minoans. Very worth a visit if you ever go to Crete. Tip: Go early.",
          "Important - first, take a private guide (around 10 euro per person in small groups) otherwise a visit to the ruins is going to be of little use. Second, take a ticket combined with the national museum in Heraklion. It costs 1 euro more and there you are going to find all things",
          "Get a guide would be my advice. There is not enough signs to explain the history of the objects and meaning behind them. Easy to get to by bus.",
          "A wonderful and a Spectacular Tour organised by Klados Travel. The 3D experience with the Tablet, and the Guide was very informative, and answered about every question I've seen asked of the place. Get a 3D Tour, and you will experience this place on a whole different level.",
          "We got there at 8:00 AM exactly and was able to grab the first parking spot right in front of the gate. There was no one on the grounds as we walked around. It was so peaceful and beautiful. After an hour, the crowds started to come so we left. But it was fascinating to see the",
          "A lot of guesses about this historical place. But it is worth a visit. Try on a cool and not too hot day.",
          "There is a danger of the Palace of Knossos failing to meet expectations. It is, after all, a site of significant historical importance so it would be easy to think that it will be dazzling. However, there is not much remaining to see. The ruins are at least 4000 years old; the",
          "I had high hopes on this archeological site but what a big disappointment when you see that almost all the ruins have been partially rebuilt with concrete by the excavator Arthur Evans ... I have seen far better in Italy for example.",

          "We went to Knossos palace on Saturday before lunch, and the place was crowded with people. We had to wait in a long line for the tickets, so it could be a good idea to buy tickets in advance. There is a possibility to hire a guide, a lot of guides are available outside the",

          "I was looking forward to visiting with my son (a recent history graduate with a keen interest in Greek mythology) but came away disappointed. The tour groups were not the problem nor the tour guides. It was the site itself which seems to have been bent to the will of one man -",
          "Wanted to visit and was content to queue and share the site with many others but it was not worth it... A sad example of how one archaeologist, Arthur Evans, destroyed what remained of what must have been an important site. Almost everything above ground has been created by him,",
          "It was very busy due to cruise ships trips being there on the same day, which was a shame as people were pushing past and through other tour groups. The floor, as you would expect is uneven, so not good for anyone who is not great on their feet. All in all a good day out, but it",
          "We arrived at 9am and it was already packed. Huge amounts of tour guides with large crowds that dominate areas so you're unable to get to see much. We wandered about aimlessly with a book for 7euros. The tour guides are around 80euros each on top of 15euro each entrance fee.",
          "Knossos is a letdown. The site is very busy, and the tour groups climb all over the site. Some of the worst tourists I've ever seen were at Knossos, blithely going past the ropes, even right in front of a guard who was busy scolding someone else for doing the same thing seconds",

          "Given it is 3,500-4,000 years old the stone structures are impressive. Reconstruction is in progress and authentic walls and some interpretation is evident. Archeological students and historical buffs will be keen to imagine how humans live so long ago. In terms of",
          "Got here but should have realised that was going to be busy as a cruise ship in port. Large que when we got here, but walked straight through with guide we took on , which I would recommend as learn a lot more about the place than reading the boards scattered all over the place.",

          "The combined ticket for the palace and museum is great value, catch the number 20 bus outside to get between the two. Paid for the guide and went round as a group of six, i feel paying for the guide is worth it if you want to know all about what you are looking at, the info",
          "My husband and I did this on our own. We got to the site just as it was opening; before all the tour groups arrived. We walked the site on our own at our leisure. It is so amazing how big it is and all the structures inside. We really liked it and by the time we were leaving all",

          "We have been to Knossos once before some years ago and I think we were more disappointed this time! It is far more commercialised than our first visit and absolutely packed with people! We drove from Agios Nikolaos and it took about an hour, although we found the signs from",
          "Ancient ruins with a great story. Worth a visit. Probably not worth paying for a guided tour as it's better to be able to wander at your own pace",
          "Arrived here at 11.20 (just at its hottest and busiest!!) And was greeted by a Greek lady asking if we wanted a tour in English. We agreed for 10\u20ac each. Only 3 of us in the end so jumped to the front of tickets queue (8\u20ac each) and skipped the toilet queue too as the guides have",
          "Firstly either get there for opening time or after 2pm as it is heaving between 10:39am & 2pm. The site will give you hours of interest but you do need to sit and read the guide every so often to appreciate what you are seeing. As much as I hate being corralled some directional",
          "Very interesting place well worth a visit but make sure you have a guide, it\u2019s unbelievable just how advanced they were",
          "Well impressed with the hole thing but our tour guide was like a mountain goat she was hot on her feet",
          "I always love a good ruin, and Knossos is absolutely the \"must see\" on Crete. It's in an absolutely stunning setting, with glorious views over the surrounding countryside, and overall they have done a good job of preserving as much as they can. It's almost as much fun to get an",

          "Recommend you visit this early in day in summer with a bottle of water as it gets really hot and although there is shade there\u2019s lots of exposed areas too. Think entrance was \u20ac15 each and you self guide yourself round. It takes about an hour I think and it really is amazing",
          "My advise is to visit the Palace in combination with the archeological museum in Heraklion. You can buy a combination ticket at the gate of the Palace. From the Palace it is a 15 minutes drive by car to the museum in Heraklion. The Palace is wonderful and, as we understand,",

          "Found this site interesting but feel they should try to give you a better layout of what it would have looked like. This was at the museum in Heraklion but should have been at the entrance at Knossos.",

          "Very few people have not heard about Knossos. It is roughly 10 kms outside Heraklion. South. And the remains date from 5000 years ago! The myth gives the King Minos and the Minataur a date in the second millennium BC. And it is have been reconstructed ! BUT there some frescos",

          "This was a lovely little trip to see the ruins I would suggest getting a tour guide they are hovering outside and will ask you if you are interested in a guide for a small fee it makes the tour round much more interesting and very informative to the back story of the ruins.",
          "Had a great time looking around the palace, there are sign posts around the area which give a description of the different buildings in English. For more information it would be better to have a guide, we didn\u2019t do this as the guides were expensive on the day but we found the",
          "We did this place ourselves instead of a guided tour which if I'm honest looked very tiring and slow.....the place has a lot of history as you would expect....I would say the a maximum of 2 hours will see you round the palace.....good and drinks are available. I would suggest",

          "We booked a guided tour to The Palace of Knossos as it was recommended by our TUI rep 'you don't visit Crete without visiting Knossos'. Our guide had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Cretan and tried her best to make the tip interesting and fun. This place is of course",
          "The most boring trip ever. Location is almost in town, not spectacular, crowded. A lot of small closed spaces with stone walls. Is common sense that the Minotaur myth appeared here. And is so expensive..15 euros not well spent..Balos Lagoon is for 1 euro They sell also tickets",
          "Really interesting, well laid-out. There are buses that stop outside, although we had a hire car (it's well-signposted and easy to find). There's a free car park next to it, and a nice, sensibly-priced cafeteria inside. Definitely take water, sunscreen and a hat. Even the",

          "This was an amazing day out. Firstly visiting the Palace then the museum in Heraklion where we saw such well preserved artefacts many of which dated from 1400 ad and older. Definitely worth a visit. You will not be disappointed!",
          "Our tour guide was not ideal and didn\u2019t teach us much in way of information. Simply explaining oh here is the drainage system and some nice pictures. Don\u2019t understand why we wasn\u2019t allowed around on our own.",
          "The site ofcourse is interesting and important, but the fee was far too expensive just to walk around. If you are not too familiar with the history make sure to take a guided tour so you understand where you are.. we didn\u2019t and we\u2019re not too happy.",
          "A full ticket is 15\u20ac. The tickets were supposed to be free for students, however, an ISIC card and foreign high school cards were not accepted. Seeing as Knossos and the Minoan culture is the cradle of European civilization, I don't see why tickets are necessary in the first",

          "What a load of rubbish , modern interpretations of what Arthur Evans from Oxford University at the turn of the century thought that it should like and parts of it have been rebuilt to reflect his vision. Site information stated \u20ac6 but actually cost \u20ac15. Don't waste money and",

          "Fascinating site but the subject of some clumsy renovations and speculation about how the palace was used. Go early-it was heaving by the time we left. We would very much recommend getting a guide other wise as someone put it, it's just a bunch of old ruins. We would also",
          "We joined a tour group for this historic site and apparently so did most of Crete at the same time. We were hustled through, the guide had to yell to be heard above other guides, a strange long que had to be formed to quickly take a picture of a throne replica and even more",

          "This place broke my heart. \u20ac15 each to enter (\u20ac0.50 if you wanna dry your hands in the toilet!) and the entire palace is paved over in concrete by Arthur Evans. Very little of the palace is preserved in its original form. The information plaques give you no history on the site,",

          "I was most disappointed with the site. Although there are many reasons why it is not as well preserved as 2000BC sites in Egypt the 'restoration' by Arthur Evans in my view ruins the place. Loads of concrete and artificial ruins and much down to his imagination. Very little",

          "Quite impressive as to how much can be seen and walked around/in/over at this location. Great for history & archeological buffs.",
          "The palast is very nicely kept and one should take a written or a tour guide to go through because it is not really self-explaining. The parking spot was for April already to small - which might be due to the fact that we arrived at 12:00 o'clock. But overall a very nice place",
          "I hadn\u2019t read much about Knossos but I knew it was an important visit to make. It\u2019s fascinating to see the extent of the palace and settlement dating back more than 4,000 years but I was much more interested in the recent history of the excavation work and then in my view the",

          "Very interesting & easy to explore/walk through. There are several plaques describing where you are, and well preserved drawings on some of the walls. Amazing archeological discovery!",
          "Worth a visit if you are interested in classical history. We know relatively little about the Minoans and that knowledge is being reassessed. We had a guide who gave us a feminist interpretation which was very different from the one from a previous trip. Its worth reading about",
          "Walking around in the ruins and partial reconstructions of the Knossos-palace is a most-have seen for anyone visiting Crete with a sense of history. Still, some reconstructions were made that are at least uncertain if the reflect the original palace - or modeled to 19-20th",
          "We visited Knossos and the archaeological museum on our own and were blown away by the superb quantity and quality of 4000 year old items on display which had been discovered in the palaces and tombs. Knossos has been rebuilt twice since 2000BC and Evans decided to reconstruct",
          "The palace was built about 1,650\u20131,450 BC and had about 1,300 rooms. It is mostly ruins. It was interesting to see and imagine how life was lived in those times.",
          "We arrived early and beat the crowds and the heat. Joined with another family for a private tour guide at the entrance which worked out to be a reasonable price per head and well worth it. If you are interested in a lovely, good value, family run Cretan taverna a short drive",
          "This could and should be a fantastic site of preserved history. However it has been completely ruined. Walking around and reading the plaques you soon learn that a professor from Oxford in the 1920s and 30s decided that instead of just excavating and preserving the ruins, he",
          "Great site with well preserved ruins. Many of the frescoes have been removed to the museum. A guide will run about 10 EURO each but is worth it to get a sense of the story behind the ruins. Visit the museum after the site to get a fuller understanding of the civilization.",
          "I read loads of stuff saying get there early n low season but chose to ignore them at my peril - if travelling independently I would recommend arriving before 9-45 am. If you manage then you can read the information boards before the hoards of buses arrrive which is great Also",
          "Really interesting but definitely recommend a guided tour. Only \u20ac10 per person and really adds to the experience. Our guide (Maria) was great, friendly and engaging. Personally I appreciate Sir Arthur Evans' reconstructions as it really helps to picture and understand the",

          "This is a spectacular site, nestled among the mountains. Partial reconstructions from the early 20th century add to the interest - in part because they give a sense of how grand the palace must have been, and in part because of the questions raised around the accuracy of modern",

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "It is an old basilica, which resisted the earthquake that destroyed most of the island's buildings, which is now a municipal gallery. While we have been there, there was a very interesting exhibition of masks of human faces from various origins. It was a well spent time.",
          "It's very close to the Lion Fountain in the center of Heraklion. Nice Venetian church but it is now used to display art. Worthwhile to go in for a few minutes to see the building's interior and whatever art is on display. No entrance fee.",

        "wiki": "Minoan pottery has been used as a tool for dating the mute Minoan civilization. Its restless sequence of quirky maturing artistic styles reveals something of Minoan patrons' pleasure in novelty while they assist archaeologists in assigning relative dates to the strata of their sites. Pots that contained oils and ointments, exported from 18th century BC Crete, have been found at sites through the Aegean islands and mainland Greece, on Cyprus, along coastal Syria and in Egypt, showing the wide trading contacts of the Minoans.\nThe pottery consists of vessels of various shapes, which as with other types of Ancient Greek pottery may be collectively referred to as \"vases\", and also \"terracottas\", small ceramic figurines, models of buildings and some other types. Some pieces, especially the cups of rhyton shape, overlap the two categories, being both vessels for liquids but essentially sculptural objects.  Several pottery shapes, especially the rhyton cup, were also produced in soft stones such as steatite, but there was almost no overlap with metal vessels.  Pottery sarcophagus chests were also made for cremated ashes, as in an example now in Hanover.\nThe finest achievements came in the Late Minoan period, with the palace pottery called Kamares ware, and the Late Minoan all-over patterned \"Marine Style\" and \"Floral Style\".  These were widely exported around the Aegean civilizations and sometimes beyond, and are the high points of the Minoan pottery tradition.\nThe best and most comprehensive collection is in the Heraklion Archaeological Museum (AMH) on Crete (where most pieces illustrated are held).\n\n\n== Traditional chronology ==\n\nThe traditional chronology for dating Minoan civilization was developed by Sir Arthur Evans in the early years of the 20th century AD. His terminology and the one proposed by Nikolaos Platon are still generally in use and appear in this article.\nFor more details, see the Minoan chronology.\nEvans classified fine pottery by the changes in its forms and styles of decoration. Platon concentrated on the episodic history of the Palace of Knossos. A new method, fabric analysis, involves geologic analysis of coarse and mainly non-decorated sherds as though they were rocks. The resulting classifications are based on composition of the sherds.\n\n\n== Production and techniques ==\nLittle is known about the way the pottery was produced, but it was probably in small artisanal workshops, often clustered in settlements near good sources of clay for potting. For many, potting may well have been a seasonal activity, combined with farming, although the volume and sophistication of later wares suggests full-time specialists, and two classes of workshop, one catering to the palaces.  There is some evidence that women were also potters.  Archaeologists seeking to understand the conditions of production have drawn tentative comparisons with aspects of both modern Cretan rural artisans and the better-documented Egyptian and Mesopotamian Bronze Age industries.  In Linear B the word for potter is \"ke-ra-me-u\".Technically, slips were widely used, with a variety of effects well understood. The potter's wheel appears to have been available from the MM1B,  but other \"handmade\" methods of forming the body remained in use, and were needed for objects with sculptural shapes.  Ceramic glazes were not used, and none of the wares were fired to very high temperatures, remaining earthenware or terracotta.  All of these characteristics remain true of later Greek pottery throughout its great period. The finest wares often have very thin-walled bodies.  The excavation of an abandoned LM kiln at Kommos (the port of Phaistos), complete with its \"wasters\" (malformed pots), is developing understanding of the details of production.  The styles of pottery show considerable regional variation within Crete in many periods.\n\n\n== Early Minoan ==\nThis is only a brief introduction to the topic of Early Minoan pottery, concentrating on some of the better-known styles; it should not be regarded as comprehensive. A variety of forms are known. The period is generally characterized by a large number of local wares with frequent Cycladic parallels or imports, suggesting a population of checkerboard ethnicity deriving from various locations in the eastern Aegean or even wider. The evidence is certainly open to interpretation, and none is decisive.\n\n\n=== FN, EM I ===\nEarly Minoan pottery, to some extent, continued, and possibly evolved from, the local Final Neolithic (FN) without a severe break. Many suggest that Minoan civilization evolved in-situ and was not imported from the East. Its other main feature is its variety from site to site, which is suggestive of localism of Early Minoan social traditions.\nStudies of the relationship between EM I and FN have been conducted mainly in East Crete. There the Final Neolithic has affinities to the Cyclades, while both FN and EM I settlements are contemporaneous, with EM I gradually replacing FN. Of the three possibilities, no immigration, total replacement of natives by immigrants, immigrants settling among natives, Hutchinson takes a compromise view:\n\n\"The Neolithic Period in Crete did not end in a catastrophe; its culture developed into that of the Bronze Age under pressure from infiltration of relatively small bands of immigrants from the south and east, where copper and bronze had long been in use.\"\n\n\n=== Pyrgos Ware ===\n\nEM I types include Pyrgos Ware, also called \"Burnished Ware\". The major form was the \"chalice\", or Arkalochori Chalice, in which a cup combined with a funnel-shaped stand could be set on a hard surface without spilling.  As the Pyrgos site was a rock shelter used as an ossuary, some hypothesize ceremonial usage]. This type of pottery was black, grey or brown, and burnished, with some sort of incised linear pattern. It may have imitated wood.\n\n\n=== Incised Ware ===\nAnother EM I type, Incised Ware, also called Scored Ware, were hand-shaped, round-bottomed, dark-burnished jugs (Example) and bulbous cups and jars (\"pyxes\"). Favored decor was incised line patterns, vertical, horizontal or herring-bone. These pots are from the north and northeast of Crete and appear to be modeled after the Kampos Phase of the Grotta-Pelos early Cycladic I culture. Some have suggested imports or immigrations. See also Hagia Photia.\n\n\n=== Agyios Onouphrios, Lebena ===\n\nThe painted parallel-line decoration of Ayios Onouphrios I Ware was drawn with an iron-red clay slip that would fire red under oxidizing conditions in a clean kiln but under the reducing conditions of a smoky fire turn darker, without much control over color, which could range from red to brown. A dark-on-light painted pattern was then applied. From this beginning, Minoan potters already concentrated on the linear forms of designs, perfecting coherent designs and voids that would ideally suit the shape of the ware. Shapes were jugs, two-handled cups and bowls. The ware came from north and south central Crete, as did Lebena Ware of the same general types but decorated by painting white patterns over a solid red painted background (Example). The latter came from EM I tombs.\n\n\n=== Koumasa and Fine Gray Ware ===\nIn EM IIA, the geometric slip-painted designs of Koumasa Ware seem to have developed from the wares of Aghios Onouphrios. The designs are in red or black on a light background. Forms are cups, bowls, jugs and teapots (Example: \"Goddess of Myrtos\"). Also from EM IIA are the cylindrical and spherical pyxides called Fine Gray Ware or just Gray Ware, featuring a polished surface with incised diagonals, dots, rings and semicircles.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Vasiliki Ware ===\nThe EM IIA and IIB Vasiliki Ware, named for the Minoan site in eastern Crete, has mottled glaze effects, early experiments with controlling color, but the elongated spouts drawn from the body and ending in semicircular spouts show the beginnings of the tradition of Minoan elegance (Examples 1, Examples 2). The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it. The effect was paralleled in cups made of mottled stone.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== EM III Pottery ===\nIn the latest brief transition (EM III), wares in eastern Crete begin to be covered in dark slip with light slip-painted decor of lines and spirals; the first checkered motifs appear; the first petallike loops and leafy bands appear, at Gournia (Walberg 1986). Rosettes appear and spiral links sometimes joined into bands. These motifs are similar to those found on seals. In north central Crete, where Knossos was to emerge, there is little similarity: dark on light linear banding prevails; footed goblets make their appearance (Example).\n\n\n== Middle Minoan ==\n\nOf the palace at Knossos and smaller ones like it at Phaestos, Mallia and elsewhere, Willetts says:\n\"These large palaces were central features of sizable cities... Apparently they were also administrative and religious centres of self-supporting regions of the island.\"The rise of the palace culture, of the \"old palaces\" of Knossos and Phaistos and their new type of urbanized, centralized society with redistribution centers required more storage vessels and ones more specifically suited to a range of functions. In palace workshops, standardization suggests more supervised operations and the rise of elite wares, emphasizing refinements and novelty, so that palace and provincial pottery become differentiated.\nThe forms of the best wares were designed for table and service. In the palace workshops, the introduction from the Levant of the potter's wheel in MMIB enabled perfectly symmetrical bodies to be thrown from swiftly revolving clay. The well-controlled iron-red slip that was added to the color repertory during MMI could be achieved only in insulated closed kilns that were free of oxygen or smoke.\n\n\n=== Pithoi ===\n\nAny population center requires facilities in support of human needs and that is true of the palaces as well. Knossos had extensive sanitation, water supply and drainage systems, which is evidence that it was not a ceremonial labyrinth or large tomb. Liquid and granular necessities were stored in pithoi located in magazines, or storage rooms, and elsewhere. Pithoi make their earliest appearance just before MMI begins and continue into Late Minoan, becoming very rare by LMIII (Examples 1, Examples 2). About 400 pithoi were found at the palace of Knossos. An average pithos held about 1100 pounds of fluid. Perhaps because of the weight, pithoi were not stored on the upper floors.\n\n\n=== New styles ===\nNew styles emerge at this time: an Incised Style, the tactile Barbotine ware, studded with knobs and cones of applied clay in bands, waves and ridges, sometimes reminiscent of sand-dollar tests and barnacle growth (Example), and the earliest stages of Kamares ware. Spirals and whorls are the favorite motifs of Minoan pottery from EM III onwards (Walberg). A new shape is the straight-sided cylindrical cup.\nMMIA wares and local pottery imitating them are found at coastal sites in the eastern Peloponnese, though not more widely in the Aegean until MMIB; their influence on local pottery in the nearby Cyclades has been studied by Angelia G. Papagiannopoulou (1991). Shards of MMIIA pottery have been recovered in Egypt and at Ugarit.\n\n\n=== Kamares Ware ===\n\nKamares Ware was named after finds in the cave sanctuary at Kamares on Mt. Ida in 1890. It is the first of the virtuoso polychrome wares of Minoan civilization, though the first expressions of recognizably proto-Kamares decor predate the introduction of the potter's wheel.\nFiner clay, thrown on the wheel, permitted more precisely fashioned forms, which were covered with a dark-firing slip and exuberantly painted with slips in white, reds and browns in fluent floral designs, of rosettes or conjoined coiling and uncoiling spirals. Designs are repetitive or sometimes free-floating, but always symmetrically composed. Themes from nature begin here with octopuses, shellfish, lilies, crocuses and palm-trees, all highly stylized. The entire surface of the pot is densely covered, but sometimes the space is partitioned by bands. One variety features extravagantly thin bodies and is called Eggshell Ware (Example 1, Example 2).\nFour stages of Kamares ware were identified by Gisela Walberg (1976), with a \"Classic Kamares\" palace style sited in MMII, especially in the palace complex of Phaistos. New shapes were introduced, with whirling and radiating motifs.(Examples 1, Examples 2, Examples 3, Examples 4, Examples 5, Examples 6, Examples 7, Examples 8, Examples 9, Examples 10)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Age of Efflorescence ===\nIn MMIIB, the increasing use of motifs drawn from nature heralded the decline and end of the Kamares style. The Kamares featured whole-field floral designs with all elements linked together (Matz). In MMIII patterned vegetative designs, the Patterned Style, began to appear. This phase was replaced by individual vegetative scenes, which marks the start of the Floral Style. Matz refers to the \"Age of Efflorescence\", which reached an apogee in LM IA. (Some would include Kamares Ware under the Floral Style.)\nThe floral style depicts palms and papyrus, with various kinds of lilies and elaborate leaves. It appears in both pottery and frescoes. One tradition of art criticism calls this the \"natural style\" or \"naturalism\" but another points out that the stylized forms and colors are far from natural. Green, the natural color of vegetation, appears rarely. Depth is represented by position around the main scene. \n\n\n== Late Minoan ==\nLMI marks the highwater of Minoan influence throughout the southern Aegean (Peloponnese, Cyclades, Dodecanese, southwestern Anatolia). Late Minoan pottery was being widely exported; it has turned up in Cyprus, the Cyclades, Egypt and Mycenae.\n\n\n=== Floral style ===\nFluent movemented designs drawn from flower and leaf forms, painted in reds and black on white grounds predominate, in steady development from Middle Minoan. In LMIB there is a typical all-over leafy decoration, for which first workshop painters begin to be identifiable through their characteristic motifs; as with all Minoan art, no name ever appears.\n\n\n=== Marine style ===\nIn LMIB, the Marine Style also emerges; in this style, perhaps inspired by frescoes, the entire surface of a pot was covered with sea creatures, octopus, fish and dolphins, against a background of rocks, seaweed and sponges (Examples 1, Examples 2, Examples 3, Examples 4). The Marine Style is more free flowing with no distinct zones, because it shows sea creatures as floating, as they would in the ocean. The Marine style was the last purely Minoan style; towards the end of LMIB, all the palaces except Knossos were violently destroyed, as were many of the villas and towns. This was because of the eruption of the volcano on the island of Thera during LMIA. The explosion caused a tsunami which hit the northern coast of Crete, and devastated the coastal settlements where the bulk of the palace complexes were located.\n\n\n=== Rhyta ===\n\nDated to LM IA and following also are conical rhyta, or drinking cups, in steatite and also imitated in ceramic. (Example) Some of the rhyta are ornate libation vessels, such as the noted \"Bull's-head Rhyton\" found at Knossos. The Bull's Head Rhyton, however, was a specific type of which many instances have been found. The bull's head is found in ceramic as well. Other noted stone vases of LM IA and II are the \"Harvester Vase\" View 1, View 3, View 4, from Hagia Triada, which depicts a harvest procession, \"the Chieftain Cup\", depicting a coming-of-age rite, the Boxer Rhyton (Hagia Triada), showing boxing scenes, the Sanctuary Rhyton, depicting a peak sanctuary to the \"mistress of animals\" and featuring birds and leaping goats, and others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Minoan-Mycenaean ==\n\nAround 1450 BCE, the beginning of LM II, the Mycenaean Greeks must have moved into the palace of Knossos. They were well-established by 1400, if the Linear B tablets can be dated to then. The resulting LM II culture is not a break with the Minoan past. Minoan traditions continue under a new administration. However, the vase forms and designs became more and more Mycenaean in character with a large variety of decoration. Style names have multiplied and depend to some degree on the author. The names below are only a few of the most common. Some authors just use the name \"Mycenaean Koine\"; that is, the Late Minoan pottery of Crete was to some degree just a variety of widespread Mycenaean forms. The designs are found also on seals and ceilings, in frescoes and on other artifacts. Often Late Minoan pottery is not easily placed in sub-periods. In addition are imports from the neighboring coasts of the Mediterranean. Ceramic is not the only material used: breccia, calcite, chlorite, schist, dolomite and other colored and patterned stone were carved into pottery forms. Bronze ware appears imitating the ceramic ware.\n\n\n=== Palace style ===\n\nDuring LMII, Mycenean influence became apparent. The vase forms at Knossos are similar to those on the mainland. The Palace Style showcased by them adapts elements of the previous styles but also adds features, such as the practice of confining decor in reserves and bands, emphasizing the base and shoulder of the pot and the movement towards abstraction (Examples 1, Examples 2, Examples 3). This style started in LM II and went on into LM III. The palace style was mostly confined to Knossos. In the late manifestation of the palace style, fluent and spontaneous earlier motifs stiffened and became more geometrical and abstracted. Egyptian motifs such as papyrus and lotus are prominent.\n\n\n=== Plain and Close Styles ===\nThe Plain Style and Close Style developed in LM IIIA, B from the Palace Style. In the Close Style the Marine and Floral Styles themes continue, but the artist manifests the horror vacui or \"dread of emptiness\". The whole field of decoration is filled densely. (Examples). The Stirrup Jar is especially frequent.\n\n\n=== The Middle East Style ===\nIIIC\n\n\n=== Subminoan ===\nFinally, in the Subminoan period, the geometric designs of the Dorians become more apparent. (Example)\n\n\n== Discovery and recognition ==\nMinoan wares were already familiar from finds on the Greek mainland, and export markets like Egypt, before it was realized that they came from Crete. In most 19th-century literature they are described as \"Mycenaean\", and the recognition and analysis of styles and periods had gone some way on this assumption.  Only in the 1890s were the first finds on Crete recognised and published, from a cave at Kamares.  These were found  by a local archaeologist who allowed the young John Myres to publish them; Myres had realized that they were the same ware as finds in Egypt published by Flinders Petrie.  For several decades analysis of Minoan pottery was essentially stylistic and typological, but in recent decades there has been a turn towards technical and socio-economic analysis.\n\n\n== Written records of pots and pans ==\nThe Linear B tablets contain records of vessels made of various materials. The vessel ideograms are not so clear as to make correlation with discovered artifacts easy. Using a drawing of the \"Contents of the Tomb of the Tripod Hearth\" at Zafer Papoura from Evans' Palace of Minos, which depicts LM II bronze vessels, many in the forms of ceramic ones, Ventris and Chadwick were able to make a few new correlations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPoppy goddess, a LM figurine\nThrapsano, then and now, a village known for pottery\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBetancourt, Philip P. 1985.

        "wiki": "Dionysus or Dionysos is the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking and wine, of fertility, orchards and fruit, vegetation, insanity, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, festivity and theatre in ancient Greek religion and myth.He is also known as Bacchus ( or ; Greek: \u0392\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, B\u00e1kkhos), the name adopted by the Romans; the frenzy he induces is bakkheia. Another name used by the Romans is Liber meaning \u201cfree\u201d, due to his association with wine and the Bacchanalia and other rites, and the freedom associated with it. His thyrsus, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. As Eleutherios (\"the liberator\"), his wine, music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.In his religion, identical with or closely related to Orphism, Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of Zeus and Persephone, and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus. Many believed that he had been born twice, having been killed and reborn as the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. In the Eleusinian Mysteries he was identified with Iacchus, the son (or, alternately, husband) of Demeter.\nHis origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. Though most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner, evidence from the Mycenaean period of Greek history show that he is one of Greece's oldest attested gods. His attribute of \"foreignness\" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called \"the god that comes\".Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus surrounding its consumption. Wine, as well as the vines and grapes that produce it, were seen as not only a gift of the god, but a symbolic incarnation of him on earth. However, rather than being a god of drunkenness, as he was often stereotyped in the post-Classical era, the religion of Dionysus centered on the correct consumption of wine, which could ease suffering and bring joy, as well as inspire divine madness distinct from drunkenness. Performance art and drama were also central to his religion, and its festivals were the initial driving force behind the development of theatre. The cult of Dionysus is also a \"cult of the souls\"; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.Dionysus is shown to be an Agriculture and Vegetation deity. His connection to wine, grape-harvest, orchards, and vegetation displays his role as a nature god. As the god of Viticulture and Grapes, he is connected to the growth and harvest of the fruit.[5] In myth, he teaches the art of growing and cultivating the plant.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe dio- prefix in Ancient Greek \u0394\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (Di\u1e53nusos; /di.\u00f3.ny\u02d0.sos/) has been associated since antiquity with Zeus (genitive Dios), and the variants of the name seem to point to an original *Dios-nysos. The earliest attestation is the Mycenaean Greek dative form \ud800\udc07\ud800\udc42\ud800\udc55\ud800\udc12 (di-wo-nu-so), featured on two tablets that had been found at Mycenaean Pylos and dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century BC. At that time, there could be no certainty on whether this was indeed a theonym, but the 1989\u201390 Greek-Swedish Excavations at Kastelli Hill, Chania, unearthed, inter alia, four artefacts bearing Linear B inscriptions; among them, the inscription on item KH Gq 5 is thought to confirm Dionysus's early worship.The second element -n\u016bsos is of unknown origin. It is perhaps associated with Mount Nysa, the birthplace of the god in Greek mythology, where he was nursed by nymphs (the Nysiads), although Pherecydes of Syros had postulated n\u0169sa as an archaic word for \"tree\" by the sixth century BC. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, since all attempts to find an Indo-European etymology have failed.\n\n\n=== Meaning and variants ===\nLater variants include Dion\u016bsos and Di\u014dn\u016bsos in Boeotia;  Dien(n)\u016bsos in Thessaly; Deon\u016bsos and Deun\u016bsos in Ionia; and Dinn\u016bsos in Aeolia, besides other variants. A Dio- prefix is found in other names, such as that of the Dioscures, and may derive from Dios, the genitive of the name of Zeus.Nonnus, in his Dionysiaca, writes that the name Dionysus means \"Zeus-limp\" and that Hermes named the new born Dionysus this, \"because Zeus while he carried his burden lifted one foot with a limp from the weight of his thigh, and nysos in Syracusan language means limping\". In his note to these lines, W. H. D. Rouse writes \"It need hardly be said that these etymologies are wrong\". The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia based on classical sources, states that Dionysus was so named \"from accomplishing [\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ] for each of those who live the wild life. Or from providing [\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd ] everything for those who live the wild life.\"\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nAcademics in the nineteenth century, using study of philology and comparative mythology, often regarded Dionysus as a foreign deity who was only reluctantly accepted into the standard Greek pantheon at a relatively late date, based on his myths which often involve this theme \u2013 a god who spends much of his time on earth abroad, and struggles for acceptance when he returns to Greece. However, more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture. The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from Mycenaean Greece, specifically in and around the Palace of Nestor in Pylos, dated to around 1300 BC. The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant, and most evidence comes in the form only of his name, written as di-wo-nu-su-jo (\"Dionysoio\") in Linear B, preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine, which was described as being \"of Dionysoio\". References have also been uncovered to \"women of Oinoa\", the \"place of wine\", who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods.Other Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther, who was the son of Zeus, and to whom oxen were sacrificed. The link to both Zeus and oxen, as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name Liber Pater, indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus. According to K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi, these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC, the core religion of Dionysus was in place, as were his important myths. At Knossos in Minoan Crete, men were often given the name \"Pentheus\", who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means \"suffering\". Ker\u00e9nyi argued that to give such a name to one's child implies a strong religious connection, potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus' followers in later myths, but as an epithet of Dionysus himself, whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it. According to Ker\u00e9nyi, the title of \"man who suffers\" likely originally referred to the god himself, only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed.\nThe oldest known image of Dionysus, accompanied by his name, is found on a dinos by the Attic potter Sophilos around 570 BC. By the seventh century, iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine. He was associated with weddings, death, sacrifice, and sexuality, and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established. A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis, at the hand of the god, of his followers into hybrid creatures, usually represented by both tame and wild satyrs, representing the transition from civilized life back to nature as a means of escape.\n\n\n== Epithets ==\n\nDionysus was variably known with the following epithets:\nAcratophorus, \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\"giver of unmixed wine\"), at Phigaleia in Arcadia.Acroreites at Sicyon.Adoneus, a rare archaism in Roman literature, a Latinised form of Adonis, used as epithet for Bacchus.Aegobolus \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Goat-shooter\") at Potniae, in Boeotia.Aesymnetes \u0391\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (\u201cruler\" or \"lord\") at Aro\u00eb and Patrae in Achaea.\nAgrios \u1f0c\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\u201cwild\"), in Macedonia.\nAndrogynos \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (androgynous in intercourse) referring to the god in sexual intercourse, doing both the active Male role and the passive Female one.Bassareus, \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 a Thracian name for Dionysus, which derives from bassaris or \"fox-skin\", which item was worn by his cultists in their mysteries.Briseus \u0392\u03c1\u1fd1\u03c3\u03b5\u1f50\u03c2 (\"he who prevails\") in Smyrna.Bromios \u0392\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Roaring\" as of the wind, primarily relating to the central death/resurrection element of the myth, but also the god's transformations into lion and bull, and the boisterousness of those who drink alcohol.

In the Roman pantheon, Sabazius became an alternative name for Bacchus.\n\n\n== Worship and festivals in Greece ==\n\nDionysus worship became firmly established by the seventh century BC. He may have been worshiped as early as c. 1500\u20131100 BC by Mycenaean Greeks; and traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete.\n\n\n=== Dionysia ===\nThe Dionysia, Haloa , Ascolia and Lenaia festivals were dedicated to Dionysus. The Rural Dionysia (or Lesser Dionysia) was one of the oldest festivals dedicated to Dionysus, begun in Attica, and probably celebrated the cultivation of vines. It was held during the winter month of Poseideon (the time surrounding the winter solstice, modern December or January). The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession, during which participants carried phalluses, long loaves of bread, jars of water and wine as well as other offerings, and young girls carried baskets. The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions.The City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia) took place in urban centers such as Athens and Eleusis, and was a later development, probably beginning during the sixth century BC. Held three months after the Rural Dionysia, the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion (modern March or April). The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations, but more elaborate, and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus, and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses. The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights, and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories.\n\n\n=== Anthestria ===\nAnthestria (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1) was an Athenian festival that celebrated the beginning of spring. It spanned three days: Pithoigia (\u03a0\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, \u201cJar-Opening\u201d), Choes (\u03a7\u03bf\u03b1\u03af, \u201cThe Pouring\u201d) and Chythroi (\u03a7\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u201cThe-Pots\u201d). It was said the dead arose from the underworld during the span of the festival. Along with the souls of the dead, the Keres also wandered through the city and had to be banished when the festival ended. On the first day, Wine vats were opened. The wine was opened and mixed in honour of the god. The rooms and the drinking vessels were adorned with flowers along with children over three years of age.On the second day, a solemn ritual for Dionysus occurred along with drinking. People dressed up, sometimes as members of Dionysus\u2019s entourage of Dionysus, and visited others. Choes was also the occasion of a solemn and secret ceremony. In one of the sanctuaries of Dionysus in the Lenaeum, which for the rest of the year was closed. The basilissa (or basilinna), wife of the basileus, underwent through a symbolic ceremonial marriage to the god, possibly representing a Hieros gamos. The basilissa was assisted by fourteen Athenian matrons (called Gerarai) who were chosen by the basileus and sworn to secrecy.The last day was dedicated to the dead. Offerings were also offered to Hermes, due to his connection to the underworld. It was considered a day of merrymaking. Some poured Libations on the tombs of deceased relatives. Chythroi ended with a ritual cry intended to order the souls of the dead to return to the underworld. Keres were also banished from the festival on the last day.To protect themselves from evil, people chewed leaves of whitethorn and smeared their doors with tar to protect themselves. The festival also allowed servants and slaves to join in on the festivites.\n\n\n=== Bacchic mysteries ===\n\nThe central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or Dionysian Mysteries. The exact origin of this religion is unknown, though Orpheus was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus. Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar Orphic Mysteries actually belong to Dionysian mysteries. Some scholars have suggested that, additionally, there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of Persephone, but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion, and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it. Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion, the major urban center of Athens played a major role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries.The Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people's lives; originally primarily for men and male sexuality, but later also created space for ritualizing women's changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman's life. This was often symbolized by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change, such as Hades and Persephone, but also with Dionysus' mother Semele, who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries.The religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls, and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god. In some instances, records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar, pole, or tree is used, while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship, and these symbols have been found together at a Minoan tomb near Phaistos in Crete.\n\n\n=== Eleusinian mysteries ===\n\nAs early as the fifth century BC, Dionysus became identified with Iacchus, a minor deity from the tradition of the Eleusinian mysteries. This association may have arisen because of the homophony of the names Iacchus and Bacchus. Two black-figure lekythoi (c. 500 BC), possibly represent the earliest evidence for such an association. The nearly-identical vases, one in Berlin, the other in Rome, depict Dionysus, along with the inscription IAKXNE, a possible miswriting of IAKXE. More early evidence can be found in the works of the fifth-century BC Athenian tragedians Sophocles and Euripides. In Sophocles' Antigone (c. 441 BC), an ode to Dionysus begins by addressing Dionysus as the \"God of many names\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5), who rules over the glens of Demeter's Eleusis, and ends by identifying him with \"Iacchus the Giver\", who leads \"the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire\" and whose \"attendant Thyiads\" dance in \"night-long frenzy\". And in a fragment from a lost play, Sophocles describes Nysa, Dionysus' traditional place of nurture: \"From here I caught sight of Nysa, haunt of Bacchus, famed among mortals, which Iacchus of the bull's horns counts as his beloved nurse\". In Euripides' Bacchae (c. 405 BC), a messenger, describing the Bacchic revelries on mount Cithaeron, associates Iacchus with Bromius, another of the names of Dionysus, saying, they \"began to wave the thyrsos ... calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice.\"An inscription found on a stone stele (c. 340 BC), found at Delphi, contains a paean to Dionysus, which describes his travels. From Thebes, where he was born, he first went to Delphi where he displayed his \"starry body\", and with \"Delphian girls\" took his \"place on the folds of Parnassus\", then next to Eleusis, where he is called \"Iacchus\":\n\nAnd in your hand brandishing your night-\nlighting flame, with god-possessed frenzy\nyou went to the vales of Eleusis\n...\nwhere the whole people of Hellas'\nland, alongside your own native witnesses\nof the holy mysteries, calls upon you\nas Iacchus: for mortals from their pains\nyou have opened a haven without toils.Strabo, says that Greeks \"give the name 'Iacchus' not only to Dionysus but also to the leader-in-chief of the mysteries\". In particular, Iacchus was identified with the Orphic Dionysus, who was a son of Persephone. Sophocles mentions \"Iacchus of the bull's horns\", and according to the first-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus, it was this older Dionysus who was represented in paintings and sculptures with horns, because he \"excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed\". Arrian, the second-century Greek historian, wrote that it was to this Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone, \"not the Theban Dionysus, that the mystic chant 'Iacchus' is sung\". The second-century poet Lucian also referred to the \"dismemberment of Iacchus\".The fourth- or fifth-century poet Nonnus associated the name Iacchus with the \"third\" Dionysus. He described the Athenian celebrations given to the first Dionysus Zagreus, son of Persephone, the second Dionysus Bromios, son of Semele, and the third Dionysus Iacchus:\n\nThey [the Athenians] honoured him as a god next after the son of Persephoneia, and after Semele's son; they established sacrifices for Dionysos late born and Dionysos first born, and third they chanted a new hymn for Iacchos. In these three celebrations Athens held high revel; in the dance lately made, the Athenians beat the step in honour of Zagreus and Bromios and Iacchos all together.By some accounts, Iacchus was the husband of Demeter. Several other sources identify Iacchus as Demeter's son. The earliest such source, a fourth-century BC vase fragment at Oxford, shows Demeter holding the child Dionysus on her lap. By the first-century BC, Demeter suckling Iacchus had become such a common motif, that the Latin poet Lucretius could use it as an apparently recognizable example of a lover's euphemism. A scholiast on the second-century AD Aristides, explicitly names Demeter as Iacchus' mother.\n\n\n=== Orphism ===\n\nIn the Orphic tradition, the \"first Dionysus\" was the son of Zeus and Persephone, and was dismembered by the Titans before being reborn. Dionysus was the patron god of the Orphics, who they connected to death and immortality, and he symbolized the one who guides the process of reincarnation.The Orphic Dionysus is sometimes referred to with the alternate name Zagreus (Greek: \u0396\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2). The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god. Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades, as either Hades' son or Hades himself. Noting \"Hades' identity as Zeus' katachthonios alter ego\", Timothy Gantz thought it likely that Zagreus, originally, perhaps, the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone. However, no known Orphic sources use the name \"Zagreus\" to refer to the Orphic Dionysus. It is possible that the association between the two was known by the third century BC, when the poet Callimachus may have written about it in a now-lost source. Callimachus, as well as his contemporary Euphorion, told the story of the dismembered of the infant Dionysus, and Byzantine sources quote Callimachus as referring to the birth of a \"Dionysos Zagreus\", explaining that Zagreus was the poets' name for the chthonic aspect of Dionysus. The earliest definitive reference to the belief that Zagreus is another name for the Orphic Dionysus is found in the late first century writings of Plutarch. The fifth century Greek poet Nonnus' Dionysiaca tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus, in which Nonnus calls him the \"older Dionysos ... illfated Zagreus\", \"Zagreus the horned baby\", \"Zagreus, the first Dionysos\", \"Zagreus the ancient Dionysos\", and \"Dionysos Zagreus\".\n\n\n== Worship and festivals in Rome ==\n\n\n=== Liber and importation to Rome ===\n\nThe mystery cult of Bacchus was brought to Rome from the Greek culture of southern Italy or by way of Greek-influenced Etruria. It was established around 200 BC in the Aventine grove of Stimula by a priestess from Campania, near the temple where Liber Pater (\"the Free Father\") had a State-sanctioned, popular cult. Liber was a native Roman god of wine, fertility, and prophecy, patron of Rome's plebeians (citizen-commoners), and one of the members of the Aventine Triad, along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera. A temple to the Triad was erected on the Aventine Hill in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of Liberalia. The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence, and by 205 BC, Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and Proserpina. Liber was often interchangeably identified with Dionysus and his mythology, though this identification was not universally accepted. Cicero insisted on the \"non-identity of Liber and Dionysus\" and described Liber and Libera as children of Ceres.Liber, like his Aventine companions, carried various aspects of his older cults into official Roman religion. He protected various aspects of agriculture and fertility, including the vine and the \"soft seed\" of its grapes, wine and wine vessels, and male fertility and virility. Pliny called Liber \"the first to establish the practice of buying and selling; he also invented the diadem, the emblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession.\" Roman mosaics and sarcophagi attest to various representations of a Dionysus-like exotic triumphal procession. In Roman and Greek literary sources from the late Republic and Imperial era, several notable triumphs feature similar, distinctively \"Bacchic\" processional elements, recalling the supposedly historic \"Triumph of Liber\".Liber and Dionysus may have had a connection that predated Classical Greece and Rome, in the form of the Mycenaean god Eleutheros, who shared the lineage and iconography of Dionysus but whose name has the same meaning as Liber. Before the importation of the Greek cults, Liber was already strongly associated with Bacchic symbols and values, including wine and uninhibited freedom, as well as the subversion of the powerful. Several depictions from the late Republic era feature processions, depicting the \"Triumph of Liber\".\n\n\n=== Bacchanalia ===\n\nIn Rome, the most well-known festivals of Bacchus were the Bacchanalia, based on the earlier Greek Dionysia festivals. These Bacchic rituals were said to have included omophagic practices, such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw. This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus, but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced \"enthusiasm\": etymologically, to let a god enter the practitioner's body or to have her become one with Bacchus.In Livy's account, the Bacchic mysteries were a novelty at Rome; originally restricted to women and held only three times a year, they were corrupted by an Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken, disinhibited men and women of all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five times a month. Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and traditional morality (mos maiorum); a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. Livy's sources, and his own account of the cult, probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic genre known as \"Satyr plays\", based on Greek originals. The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, Those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.\nBacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber, and his festival was inserted into the Liberalia. In Roman culture, Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents. Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth, Bacchus became euhemerised as a historical hero, conqueror, and founder of cities. He was a patron deity and founding hero at Leptis Magna, birthplace of the emperor Septimius Severus, who promoted his cult. In some Roman sources, the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger-drawn chariot, surrounded by maenads, satyrs and drunks, commemorates the god's triumphant return from the conquest of India. Pliny believed this to be the historical prototype for the Roman Triumph.\n\n\n== Post-classical worship ==\n\n\n=== Late Antiquity ===\nIn the Neoplatonist philosophy and religion of Late Antiquity, the Olympian gods were sometimes considered to number 12 based on their spheres of influence. For example, according to Sallustius, \"Jupiter, Neptune, and Vulcan fabricate the world; Ceres, Juno, and Diana animate it; Mercury, Venus, and Apollo harmonize it; and, lastly, Vesta, Minerva, and Mars preside over it with a guarding power.\" The multitude of other gods, in this belief system, subsist within the primary gods, and Sallustius taught that Bacchus subsisted in Jupiter.In the Orphic tradition, a saying was supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo that stated \"Zeus, Hades, [and] Helios-Dionysus\" were \"three gods in one godhead.\" This statement apparently conflated Dionysus not only with Hades, but also his father Zeus, and implied a particularly close identification with the sun-god Helios. When quoting this in his Hymn to King Helios, Emperor Julian substituted Dionysus' name with that of Serapis, whose Egyptian counterpart Osiris was also identified with Dionysus.\n\n\n=== Worship from the Middle Ages to the Modern period ===\n\nThough the last known worshippers of the Greek and Roman gods were converted before 1000 AD, there were several isolated instances of revived worship of Dionysus during the Medieval and early modern periods. With the rise of modern neopaganism and Hellenic polytheism, worship of the god has once again been revived.\nAccording to the Lanercost chronicle, during Easter in 1282 in Scotland, the parish priest of Inverkeithing led young women in a dance in honor of Priapus and Father Liber, commonly identified with Dionysus. The priest danced and sang at the front, carrying a representation of the phallus on a pole. He was killed by a Christian mob later that year. Historian C. S. Watkins believes that Richard of Durham, the author of the chronicle, identified an occurrence of apotropaic magic with his knowledge of ancient Greek religion, rather than recording an actual case of survival of pagan rituals.The late medieval Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho secretly advocated in favor of a return to paganism in medieval Greece.In the eighteenth century, Hellfire Clubs sprung up in Britain and Ireland. Though activities varied between the clubs, some of them were very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices. Dionysus was one of the most popular deities, alongside deities like Venus and Flora. Today one can still see the statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves.In 1820, Ephraim Lyon founded the Church of Bacchus in Eastford, Connecticut. He declared himself High Priest, and added local drunks to the list of membership. He maintained that those who died as members would go to a Bacchanalia for their afterlife.Modern pagan and polytheist groups often include worship of Dionysus in their traditions and practices, most prominently groups which have sought to revive Hellenic polytheism, such as the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes (YSEE). In addition to libations of wine, modern worshipers of Dionysus offer the god grape vines, ivy, and various forms of incense, particularly styrax. They may also celebrate Roman festivals such as the Liberalia (March 17, close to the Spring Equinox) or Bacchanalia (Various dates), and various Greek festivals such as the Anthesteria, Lenaia, and the Greater and Lesser Dionysias, the dates of which are calculated by the lunar calendar.\n\n\n== Identification with other gods ==\n\n\n=== Osiris ===\n\nIn the Greek interpretation of the Egyptian pantheon, Dionysus was often identified with Osiris. Stories of the dismemberment of Osiris and the re-assembly and resurrection by Isis closely parallel those of the Orphic Dionysus and Demeter. According to Diodorus Siculus, as early as the fifth century BC, the two gods had been syncretized as a single deity known as Dionysus-Osiris. The most notable record of this belief is found in Herodotus' 'Histories'. Plutarch also described his belief that Osiris and Dionysus were identical, stating that anyone familiar with the secret rituals associated with both gods would recognize obvious parallels, and that their dismemberment myths and associated public symbols are enough additional evidence that they are the same god worshiped by two different cultures.Other syncretic Greco-Egyptian deities arose out of this conflation, including with the gods Serapis and Hermanubis. Serapis was believed to be both Hades and Osiris, and the Roman Emperor Julian considered him the same as Dionysus as well. Dionysus-Osiris was particularly popular in Ptolemaic Egypt, as the Ptolemies claimed descent from Dionysus, and as Pharaoes they had claim to the lineage of Osiris. This association was most notable during a deification ceremony where Mark Antony became Dionysus-Osiris, alongside Cleopatra as Isis-Aphrodite.Egyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris, killed him, divided his body into equal parts, and \"slipped them secretly out of the house\". All but Osiris' penis, which since none of them \"was willing to take it with him\", they threw into the river. Isis, Osiris' wife, hunted down and killed the Titans, reassembled Osiris' body parts \"into the shape of a human figure\", and gave them \"to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god\". But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests \"to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position.\"\n\n\n=== Hades ===\n\nThe fifth\u2013fourth century BC philosopher Heraclitus, unifying opposites, declared that Hades and Dionysus, the very essence of indestructible life (zo\u00eb), are the same god. Among other evidence, Karl Ker\u00e9nyi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn \"To Demeter\", votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus. He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine, as she states that it would be against themis for her to drink wine, which is the gift of Dionysus, after Persephone's abduction, because of this association; indicating that Hades may in fact have been a \"cover name\" for the underworld Dionysus. He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries. One of the epithets of Dionysus was \"Chthonios\", meaning \"the subterranean\".Evidence for a cult connection is quite extensive, particularly in southern Italy, especially when considering the heavy involvement of death symbolism included in Dionysian worship; statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis gives further evidence as the statues found bear a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus, also called Aides Kyanochaites (Hades of the flowing dark hair), known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the Underworld. The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness Ancient portrayals show Dionysus holding in his hand the kantharos, a wine-jar with large handles, and occupying the place where one would expect to see Hades. Archaic artist Xenocles portrayed on one side of a vase, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, each with his emblems of power; with Hades' head turned back to front and, on the other side, Dionysus striding forward to meet his bride Persephone, with the kantharos in his hand, against a background of grapes. Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as Chthonios, Eubouleus and Euclius.\nBoth Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus. Zeus, like Dionysus, was occasionally believed to have an underworld form, closely identified with Hades, to the point that they were occasionally thought of as the same god.According to Marguerite Rigoglioso, Hades is Dionysus, and this dual god was believed by the Eleusinian tradition to have impregnated Persephone. This would bring the Eleusinian in harmony with the myth in which Zeus, not Hades, impregnated Persephone to bear the first Dionysus. Rigoglioso argues that taken together, these myths suggest a belief that is that, with Persephone, Zeus/Hades/Dionysus created (in terms quoted from Ker\u00e9nyi) \"a second, a little Dionysus,\" who is also a \"subterranean Zeus.\" The unification of Hades, Zeus, and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the 'shining' realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades. According to Rosemarie Taylor-Perry, \"it is often mentioned that Zeus, Hades and Dionysus were all attributed to being the exact same god... Being a tripartite deity Hades is also Zeus, doubling as being the Sky God or Zeus, Hades abducts his 'daughter' and paramour Persephone. The taking of Kore by Hades is the act which allows the conception and birth of a second integrating force: Iacchos (Zagreus-Dionysus), also known as Liknites, the helpless infant form of that Deity who is the unifier of the dark underworld (chthonic) realm of Hades and the Olympian (\"Shining\") one of Zeus.\"\n\n\n=== Sabazios and Yahweh ===\n\nThe Phrygian god Sabazios was alternately identified with Zeus or with Dionysus. The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, Suda (c. tenth century), stated: Sabazios ... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry \"sabazein\". Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry \"sabasmos\"; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call \"saboi\" those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes ... Demosthenes [in the speech] \"On Behalf of Ktesiphon\" [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.\nStrabo, in the first century, linked Sabazios with Zagreus among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos. Strabo's Sicilian contemporary, Diodorus Siculus, conflated Sabazios with the secret Dionysus, born of Zeus and Persephone, However, this connection is not supported by any surviving inscriptions, which are entirely to Zeus Sabazios.Several ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the Jewish people, Yahweh, was identifiable as Dionysus or Liber via his identification with Sabazios. Tacitus, Lydus, Cornelius Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief (though some, like Tacitus, specifically brought it up in order to reject it). According to Plutarch, one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words \"Euoe\" and \"Sabi\", a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius. According to scholar Sean McDonough, it is possible that Plutarch's sources had confused the cry of \"Iao Sabaoth\" (typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh) with the Sabazian cry of \"Euoe Saboe\", originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities. The cry of \"Sabi\" could also have been conflated with the Jewish term \"sabbath\", adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus/Sabazius were the same deity. Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the Maccabees that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes, vine leaves, and cups. However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus/Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to 55 BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled \"Bacchus Judaeus\" (BACCHIVS IVDAEVS), and in 139 BC praetor Cornelius Scipio Hispalus deported Jewish people for attempting to \"infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius\".\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\nVarious different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage, birth, and life of Dionysus on earth, complicated by his several rebirths. By the first century BC, some mythographers had attempted to harmonize the various accounts of Dionysus' birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births, but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes. The historian Diodorus Siculus said that according to \"some writers of myths\" there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone, but that the \"younger one also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.\" He also said that Dionysus \"was thought to have two forms...the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, the younger one being youthful and effeminate and young.\"\n\nThough the varying genealogy of Dionysus was mentioned in many works of classical literature, only a few contain the actual narrative myths surrounding the events of his multiple births. These include the first century BC Bibliotheca historica by Greek historian Diodorus, which describes the birth and deeds of the three incarnations of Dionysus; the brief birth narrative given by the first century AD Roman author Hyginus, which describes a double birth for Dionysus; and a longer account in the form of Greek poet Nonnus's epic Dionysiaca, which discusses three incarnations of Dionysus similar to Diodorus' account, but which focuses on the life of the third Dionysus, born to Zeus and Semele.\n\n\n=== First birth ===\nThough Diodorus mentions some traditions which state an older, Indian or Egyptian Dionysus existed who invented wine, no narratives are given of his birth or life among mortals, and most traditions ascribe the invention of wine and travels through India to the last Dionysus. According to Diodorus, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and Persephone (or alternately, Zeus and Demeter). This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts, and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics, who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. Nonnus calls this Dionysus Zagreus, while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with Sabazius. However, unlike Hyginus and Nonnus, Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god. It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how to use oxen to plow the fields, rather than doing so by hand. His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns.\n\nThe Greek poet Nonnus gives a birth narrative for Dionysus in his late fourth or early fifth century AD epic Dionysiaca. In it, he described how Zeus \"intended to make a new Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos\" who was the Egyptian god Osiris. (Dionysiaca 4) Zeus took the shape of a serpent (\"drakon\"), and \"ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia.\" According to Nonnus, though Persephone was \"the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld\", she remained a virgin, and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors, because \"all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid.\" (Dionysiaca 5) After her union with Zeus, Perseophone's womb \"swelled with living fruit\", and she gave birth to a horned baby, named Zagreus. Zagreus, despite his infancy, was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts, marking him a Zeus' heir. Hera saw this and alerted the Titans, who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus \"while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror.\" They attacked him. However, according to Nonnus, \"where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos.\" He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack, including Zeus, Kronos, a baby, and \"a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black.\" He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans, including a lion, a wild horse, a horned serpent, a tiger, and, finally, a bull. Hera intervened, killing the bull with a shout, and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in Tartaros. This caused the mother of the Titans, Gaia, to suffer, and her symptoms were seen across the whole world, resulting in fires and floods, and boiling seas. Zeus took pity on her, and in order to cool down the burning land, he caused great rains to flood the world. (Dionysiaca 6)\n\n\n==== Interpretation ====\n\nIn the Orphic tradition, Dionysus was, in part, a god associated with the underworld. As a result, the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone, and believed that he had been dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. The myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus was alluded to as early as the fourth century BC by Plato in his Phaedo, in which Socrates claims that the initiations of the Dionysian Mysteries are similar to those of the philosophic path. Late Neoplatonists such as Damascius explored the implications of this at length. The dismemberment of Dionysus (the sparagmos) is often considered to be the most important myth of Orphism.Many modern sources identify this \"Orphic Dionysus\" with the god Zagreus, though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics, who simply called him Dionysus. As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. The infant was taken to Mount Ida, where, like the infant Zeus, he was guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful scepter.As Diodorus relates, one school of thought holds that Dionysus was not literally born on earth at all, but rather, his birth narrative is an allegory for the generative power of the gods at work in nature. In this account, Dionysus is said to be the son of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture. When the \"Sons of Gaia\" (i.e. the Titans) boiled Dionysus following his birth, Demeter gathered together his remains, allowing his rebirth. Diodorus noted the symbolism this myth held for its adherents: Dionysus, god of the vine, was born from the gods of the rain and the earth. He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia, or \"earth born\", symbolizing the harvesting and wine-making process. Just as the remains of the bare vines are returned to the earth to restore its fruitfulness, the remains of the young Dionysus were returned to Demeter allowing him to be born again.\n\n\n=== Second birth ===\n\nThe birth narrative given by Gaius Julius Hyginus (c. 64 BC \u2013 17 AD) in Fabulae 167, agrees with the Orphic tradition that Liber (Dionysus) was originally the son of Jove (Zeus) and Proserpine (Persephone). Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans, so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to Semele, the daughter of Harmonia and Cadmus, king and founder of Thebes. This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant. Juno appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse, Beroe, and told her: \"Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.\" When Semele requested that Jove do so, she was killed by a thunderbolt. Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb, and put him in the care of Nysus. Hyginus states that \"for this reason he is called Dionysus, and also the one with two mothers\" (dim\u0113t\u014dr).Nonnus describes how, when life was rejuvenated after the flood, it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus. \"The Seasons, those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking. Without Bacchos to inspire the dance, its grace was only half complete and quite without profit; it charmed only the eyes of the company, when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps, having only nods for words, hand for mouth, fingers for voice.\" Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine, to alleviate their toil, war, and suffering. After he became protector of humanity, Zeus promises, Dionysus would struggle on earth, but be received \"by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars.\" (Dionysiaca 7).\n\nThe mortal princess Semele then had a dream, in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning, but did not harm the fruit. He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits, and sewed it into his thigh, so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus. She saw the bull-shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh, and then came to the realization that she herself had been the tree. Her father Cadmus, fearful of the prophetic dream, instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus. Zeus came to Semele in her bed, adorned with various symbols of Dionysus. He transformed into a snake, and \"Zeus made long wooing, and shouted \"Euoi!\" as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry.\" Immediately, Semele's bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers, and the earth laughed. Zeus then spoke to Semele, revealing his true identity, and telling her to be happy: \"you bring forth a son who shall not die, and you I will call immortal. Happy woman! you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles, you shall bring forth joy for gods and men.\" (Dionysiaca 7).During her pregnancy, Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine. She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy, and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music. Hera became envious, and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus. She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus' wet nurse. She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus' gave to Hera, compared with their own brief liaison, and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood. Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself. Zeus answered her prayers, but warned her than no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts. Semele reached out to touch them, and was burnt to ash. (Dionysiaca 8). But the infant Dionysus survived, and Zeus rescued him from the flames, sewing him into his thigh. \"So the rounded thigh in labour became female, and the boy too soon born was brought forth, but not in a mother\u2019s way, having passed from a mother\u2019s womb to a father\u2019s.\" (Dionysiaca 9). At his birth, he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon. The Seasons crowned him with ivy and flowers, and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns.An alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition. In it, Dionysus is the son of Ammon, who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi-historical king of Libya. Ammon had married the goddess Rhea, but he had an affair with Amaltheia, who bore Dionysus. Ammon feared Rhea's wrath if she were to discover the child, so he took the infant Dionysus to Nysa (Dionysus' traditional childhood home). Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa, a daughter of the hero Aristaeus. Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts, his beauty, and his strength. It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood. His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea, who was furious with Ammon for his deception. She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but, unable to do so, she left Ammon and married Cronus.\n\n\n==== Interpretation ====\n\nEven in antiquity, the account of Dionysus' birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time, a suggestion of Euhemerism (an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history) often applied to demi-gods. The fourth century Roman emperor and philosopher Julian encountered examples of this belief, and wrote arguments against it. In his letter To the Cynic Heracleios, Julian wrote \"I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele, and that he became a god through his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries, and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus.\" However, to Julian, the myth of Dionysus's birth (and that of Heracles) stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth. The birth of Dionysus, Julian argues, was \"no birth but a divine manifestation\" to Semele, who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear. However, Semele was impatient for the god to come, and began revealing his mysteries too early; for her transgression, she was struck down by Zeus. When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity, for it to \"pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life\", he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible, spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals. In Julian's interpretation, the Greeks \"called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made, but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.\" The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus, per Julian, was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world, but entering into it, though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the intelligible realm.\n\n\n=== Infancy ===\n\nAccording to Nonnus, Zeus gave the infant Dionysus to the care of Hermes. Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides, or daughters of Lamos, who were river nymphs. But Hera drove the Lamides mad, and caused them to attack Dionysus, who was rescued by Hermes. Hermes next brought the infant to Ino for fostering by her attendant Mystis, who taught him the rites of the mysteries (Dionysiaca 9). In Apollodorus' account, Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl, in order to hide him from Hera's wrath. However, Hera found him, and vowed to destroy the house with a flood; however, Hermes again rescued Dionysus, this time bringing him to the mountains of Lydia. Hermes adopted the form of Phanes, most ancient of the gods, and so Hera bowed before him and let him pass. Hermes gave the infant to the goddess Rhea, who cared for him through his adolescence.Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars (see Hyades star cluster). In yet another version of the myth, he is raised by his cousin Macris on the island of Euboea.\n\nDionysus in Greek mythology is a god of foreign origin, and while Mount Nysa is a mythological location, it is invariably set far away to the east or to the south. The Homeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus places it \"far from Phoenicia, near to the Egyptian stream\". Others placed it in Anatolia, or in Libya (\"away in the west beside a great ocean\"), in Ethiopia (Herodotus), or Arabia (Diodorus Siculus).\nAccording to Herodotus:\n\nAs it is, the Greek story has it that no sooner was Dionysus born than Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to Nysa in Ethiopia beyond Egypt; and as for Pan, the Greeks do not know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge.\nThe Bibliotheca seems to be following Pherecydes, who relates how the infant Dionysus, god of the grapevine, was nursed by the rain-nymphs, the Hyades at Nysa. Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the centaur Chiron. According to Ptolemy Chennus in the Library of Photius, \"Dionysus was loved by Chiron, from whom he learned chants and dances, the bacchic rites and initiations.\"\n\n\n=== Travels and invention of wine ===\n\nWhen Dionysus grew up, he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice, being the first to do so; but Hera struck him with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Cybele, better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted several years. According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.\nAnother myth according to Nonnus involves Ampelus, a satyr, who was loved by Dionysus.  As related by Ovid, Ampelus became the constellation Vindemitor, or the \"grape-gatherer\": ...not so will the Grape-gatherer escape thee. The origin of that constellation also can be briefly told. 'Tis said that the unshorn Ampelus, son of a nymph and a satyr, was loved by Bacchus on the Ismarian hills. Upon him the god bestowed a vine that trailed from an elm's leafy boughs, and still the vine takes from the boy its name. While he rashly culled the gaudy grapes upon a branch, he tumbled down; Liber bore the lost youth to the stars.\" Another story of Ampelus was related by Nonnus: in an accident foreseen by Dionysus, the youth was killed while riding a bull maddened by the sting of a gadfly sent by At\u00eb, the Goddess of Folly. The Fates granted Ampelus a second life as a vine, from which Dionysus squeezed the first wine.\n\n\n=== Return to Greece ===\n\nReturning in triumph to Greece after his travels in Asia, Dionysus came to be considered the founder of the triumphal procession. He undertook efforts to introduce his religion into Greece, but was opposed by rulers who feared it, on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it.\n\nIn one myth, adapted in Euripides' play The Bacchae, Dionysus returns to his birthplace, Thebes, which is ruled by his cousin Pentheus. Pentheus, as well as his mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autonoe, disbelieve Dionysus' divine birth. Despite the warnings of the blind prophet Tiresias, they deny him worship and denounce him for inspiring the women of Thebes to madness.\nDionysus uses his divine powers to drive Pentheus insane, then invites him to spy on the ecstatic rituals of the Maenads, in the woods of Mount Cithaeron. Pentheus, hoping to witness a sexual orgy, hides himself in a tree. The Maenads spot him; maddened by Dionysus, they take him to be a mountain-dwelling lion, and attack him with their bare hands. Pentheus' aunts and his mother Agave are among them, and they rip him limb from limb. Agave mounts his head on a pike, and takes the trophy to her father Cadmus. The madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes Agave and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents. Only Tiresias is spared.\n\nWhen King Lycurgus of Thrace heard that Dionysus was in his kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus' followers, the Maenads. Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis, and sent a drought which stirred the people to revolt. The god then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe in the belief that he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus lived, and his people had him drawn and quartered. Appeased by the king's death, Dionysus lifted the curse. This story is told in Homer's Iliad 6.136\u2013137. In an alternative version, sometimes depicted in art, Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia, a follower of Dionysus, who was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and slowly strangled him.\n\n\n=== Captivity and escape ===\n\nThe Homeric Hymn 7 to Dionysus recounts how, while he sat on the seashore, some sailors spotted him, believing him a prince. They attempted to kidnap him and sail away to sell him for ransom or into slavery. No rope would bind him. The god turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board, killing all in his path. Those who jumped ship were mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman, Acoetes, who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start.In a similar story, Dionysus hired a Tyrrhenian pirate ship to sail from Icaria to Naxos. When he was aboard, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia, intending to sell him as a slave. This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into dolphins. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates, but transforms to a divine adult when on board.\nMany of the Dionysus myths involve the god, whose birth was secret, defending his godhead against skeptics. Malcolm Bull notes that \"It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated\". Paola Corrente notes that in many sources, the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus' time among mortals. In that sense, it serves as final proof of his divinity, and is often followed by his descent into Hades to retrieve his mother, both of whom can then ascend into heaven to live alongside the other Olympian gods.\n\n\n=== Descent to the underworld ===\n\nPausanias, in book II of his Description of Greece, describes two variant traditions regarding Dionysus' katabasis, or descent into the underworld. Both describe how Dionysus entered into the afterlife to rescue his mother Semele, and bring her to her rightful place on Olympus. To do so, he had to contend with the hell dog Cerberus, which was restrained for him by Heracles. After retrieving Semele, Dionysus emerged with her from the unfathomable waters of a lagoon on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, according to the local tradition. This mythic event was commemorated with a yearly nighttime festival, the details of which were held secret by the local religion. According to Paola Corrente, the emergence of Dionysus from the waters of the lagoon may signify a form of rebirth for both him and Semele as they reemerged from the underworld. A variant of this myth forms the basis of Aristophanes' comedy The Frogs.According to the Christian writer Clement of Alexandria, Dionysus was guided in his journey by Prosymnus or Polymnus, who requested, as his reward, to be Dionysus' lover. Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge, so to satisfy Prosymnus' shade, Dionysus fashioned a phallus from an olive branch and sat on it at Prosymnus' tomb. This story survives in full only in Christian sources, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology, but it appears to have also served to explain the origin of secret objects used by the Dionysian Mysteries.This same myth of Dionysus' descent to the underworld is related by both Diodorus Siculus in his first century BC work Bibliotheca historica, and Pseudo-Apollodorus in the third book of his first century AD work Bibliotheca. In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess. In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.\n\n\n=== Secondary myths ===\n\n\n==== Midas' golden touch ====\nDionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father, Silenus, had gone missing. The old man had wandered away drunk, and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king Midas (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden). The king recognized him hospitably, feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward.\nMidas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone, but his joy vanished when he found that his bread, meat, and wine also turned to gold. Later, when his daughter embraced him, she too turned to gold.\nThe horrified king strove to divest the Midas Touch, and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation. The god consented, telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. As he did so, the power passed into them, and the river sands turned gold: this etiological myth explained the gold sands of the Pactolus.\n\n\n==== Other myths ====\nWhen Hephaestus bound Hera to a magical chair, Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.\nWhen Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but he committed suicide or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos, for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.\nA third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by Aristophanes in his comedy The Frogs. Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival, the Dionysia, wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians. After a poetry slam, Aeschylus is chosen in preference to Euripides.\nPsalacantha, a nymph, failed to win the love of Dionysus in preference to Ariadne, and ended up being changed into a plant.\nDionysus fell in love with a handsome satyr named Ampelos, who was killed. He was changed into a grape-vine or grape gathering constellation upon death. There are two versions of his death. In Dionysiaca, Ampelos is killed by Selene due to him challenging her. In another, recorded by Ovid, Ampelos fell and died because he was trying to pick grapes from a branch. Upon death, he is turned into a Constellation.Lycurgus [6]  was a king of Edonia in or somewhere in the region of west Asia. He drove Dionysus and his nurses fleeing from their home on Mount Nysa to seek the refuge with Thetis. Due to this, he was punished by being driven mad. He hacked apart his own wife and child because of the madness induced belief they were spreading vines, and later driven from his home and was devoured by wild beasts on Mt Pangaios.Callirrhoe was a Calydonian woman who scorned Coresus, a priest of Dionysus, who threatened to afflict all the women of Calydon with insanity (see Maenad). The priest was ordered to sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe threw herself into a well which was later named after her.\n\n\n== Lovers and offspring ==\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\n\n=== Symbols ===\n\nThe earliest cult images of Dionysus show a mature male, bearded and robed. He holds a fennel staff, tipped with a pine-cone and known as a thyrsus. Later images show him as a beardless, sensuous, naked or half-naked androgynous youth: the literature describes him as womanly or \"man-womanish\". In its fully developed form, his central cult imagery shows his triumphant, disorderly arrival or return, as if from some place beyond the borders of the known and civilized. His procession (thiasus) is made up of wild female followers (maenads) and bearded satyrs with erect penises; some are armed with the thyrsus, some dance or play music. The god himself is drawn in a chariot, usually by exotic beasts such as lions or tigers, and is sometimes attended by a bearded, drunken Silenus. This procession is presumed to be the cult model for the followers of his Dionysian Mysteries. Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and he thus symbolizes the chaotic, dangerous and unexpected, everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods.Dionysus was a god of resurrection and he was strongly linked to the bull. In a cult hymn from Olympia, at a festival for Hera, Dionysus is invited to come as a bull; \"with bull-foot raging\". Walter Burkert relates, \"Quite frequently [Dionysus] is portrayed with bull horns, and in Kyzikos he has a tauromorphic image\", and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the Titans.\n\nThe snake and phallus were symbols of Dionysus in ancient Greece, and of Bacchus in Greece and Rome. He typically wears a panther or leopard skin and carries a Thyrsus \u2013 a long stick or wand topped with a pine cone. His iconography sometimes include maenads, who wear wreaths of ivy and serpents around their hair or neck.The cult of Dionysus was closely associated with trees, specifically the fig tree, and some of his bynames exhibit this, such as  Endendros \"he in the tree\" or  Dendrit\u0113s, \"he of the tree\". Peters suggests the original meaning as \"he who runs among the trees\", or that of a \"runner in the woods\". Janda (2010) accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of \"he who impels the (world-)tree\". This interpretation explains how Nysa could have been re-interpreted from a meaning of \"tree\" to the name of a mountain: the axis mundi of Indo-European mythology is represented both as a world-tree and as a world-mountain.Dionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn. In the Mediterranean summer, marked by the rising of the dog star Sirius, the weather becomes extremely hot, but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow. Late summer, when Orion is at the center of the sky, was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece. Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy. Pindar describes the \"pure light of high summer\" as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself. An image of Dionysus' birth from Zeus' thigh call him \"the light of Zeus\" (Dios phos) and associate him with the light of Sirius.\n\n\n=== In classical art ===\n\nThe god, and still more often his followers, were commonly depicted in the painted pottery of Ancient Greece, much of which made to hold wine. But, apart from some reliefs of maenads, Dionysian subjects rarely appeared in large sculpture before the Hellenistic period, when they became common. In these, the treatment of the god himself ranged from severe archaising or Neo Attic types such as the Dionysus Sardanapalus to types showing him as an indolent and androgynous young man, often nude. Hermes and the Infant Dionysus is probably a Greek original in marble, and the Ludovisi Dionysus group is probably a Roman original of the second century AD. Well-known Hellenistic sculptures of Dionysian subjects, surviving in Roman copies, include the Barberini Faun, the Belvedere Torso, the Resting Satyr. The Furietti Centaurs and Sleeping Hermaphroditus reflect related subjects, which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit. The marble Dancer of Pergamon is an original, as is the bronze Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo, a recent recovery from the sea.\nThe Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe pastoral into which other semi-divine creatures of the countryside have been co-opted, such as centaurs, nymphs, and the gods Pan and Hermaphrodite. \"Nymph\" by this stage \"means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors, a non-wild bacchant\". Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants, many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths, and \"most should be seen as part of his realm. They have in common with satyrs and nymphs that they are creatures of the outdoors and are without true personal identity.\" The fourth-century BC Derveni Krater, the unique survival of a very large scale Classical or Hellenistic metal vessel of top quality, depicts Dionysus and his followers.\nDionysus appealed to the Hellenistic monarchies for a number of reasons, apart from merely being a god of pleasure: He was a human who became divine, he came from, and had conquered, the East, exemplified a lifestyle of display and magnificence with his mortal followers, and was often regarded as an ancestor. He continued to appeal to the rich of Imperial Rome, who populated their gardens with Dionysian sculpture, and by the second century AD were often buried in sarcophagi carved with crowded scenes of Bacchus and his entourage.The fourth-century AD Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a spectacular cage cup which changes colour when light comes through the glass; it shows the bound King Lycurgus being taunted by the god and attacked by a satyr; this may have been used for celebration of Dionysian mysteries. Elizabeth Kessler has theorized that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphos, Cyprus, details a monotheistic worship of Dionysus. In the mosaic, other gods appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally imposed Dionysus. The mid-Byzantine Veroli Casket shows the tradition lingering in Constantinople around 1000 AD, but probably not very well understood.\n\n\n== Post-classical culture ==\n\n\n=== Art from the Renaissance on ===\n\nBacchic subjects in art resumed in the Italian Renaissance, and soon became almost as popular as in antiquity, but his \"strong association with feminine spirituality and power almost disappeared\", as did \"the idea that the destructive and creative powers of the god were indissolubly linked\". In Michelangelo's statue (1496\u201397) \"madness has become merriment\". The statue aspires to suggest both drunken incapacity and an elevated consciousness, but this was perhaps lost on later viewers, and typically the two aspects were thereafter split, with a clearly drunk Silenus representing the former, and a youthful Bacchus often shown with wings, because he carries the mind to higher places.\n\nTitian's Bacchus and Ariadne (1522\u201323) and The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1523\u201326), both painted for the same room, offer an influential heroic pastoral, while Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in The Triumph of Bacchus (or Los borrachos \u2013 \"the drinkers\", c. 1629) and Jusepe de Ribera in his Drunken Silenus choose a genre realism. Flemish Baroque painting frequently painted the Bacchic followers, as in Van Dyck's Drunken Silenus and many works by Rubens; Poussin was another regular painter of Bacchic scenes.A common theme in art beginning in the sixteenth century was the depiction of Bacchus and Ceres caring for a representation of love \u2013 often Venus, Cupid, or Amore. This tradition derived from a quotation by the Roman comedian Terence (c. 195/185 \u2013 c. 159 BC) which became a popular proverb in the Early Modern period: Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus (\"without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes\"). Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period 1550\u20131630, especially in Northern Mannerism in Prague and the Low Countries, as well as by Rubens. Because of his association with the vine harvest, Bacchus became the god of autumn, and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons.\n\n\n=== Modern literature and philosophy ===\n\nDionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In The Birth of Tragedy (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterized as a \"modern myth\", as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and is not found in classical sources. However, the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great, that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship.Nietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil, and later The Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained will to power. In The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God (1904), and Dionysus and Early Dionysianism (1921), the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates the theory of Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Karl Ker\u00e9nyi characterizes Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force (Greek Zo\u00ea). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus' emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god. Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes should be kept in an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection, which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London.\nIn CS Lewis' Prince Caspian (part of The Chronicles of Narnia), Bacchus is a dangerous-looking, androgynous young boy who helps Aslan awaken the spirits of the Narnian trees and rivers. Rick Riordan's series of books Percy Jackson & The Olympians presents Dionysus as an uncaring, childish and spoiled god. In the graphic novel The Wicked + The Divine, the gods reincarnate as pop stars: Dionysus is the \"dancefloor that walks like a man\", associated with the ecstatic release of rave culture. In the novel Household Gods by Harry Turtledove and Judith Tarr, Nicole Gunther-Perrin is a lawyer in the twentieth century. She makes a libation to Liber and Libera, Roman equivalents of Dionysus and Persephone, and is transported back in time to ancient Rome. In The Secret History by Donna Tartt, a group of classics students reflect on reviving the worship of Dionysus during their time in college.\n\n\n=== Modern film and performance art ===\nWalt Disney depicted Bacchus in the \"Pastoral\" segment of the animated film Fantasia, as a Silenus-like character. In 1969, an adaption of The Bacchae was performed, called Dionysus in '69. A film was made of the same performance. The production was notable for involving audience participation, nudity, and theatrical innovations. In 1974, Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove adapted Aristophanes' comedy The Frogs into a modern musical, which hit broadway in 2004 and was revived in London in 2017. The musical keeps the descent of Dionysus into Hades to bring back a playwright; however, the playwrights are updated to modern times, and Dionysus is forced to choose between George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare.In 2006, The Orion Experience, in the album Cosmocandy includes a song titled Cult of Dionysus. The song invokes themes from the god\u2019s cult. The entire album is described as \u201cshort, sharp, and ultimately memorable, glowing with a long-forgotten disco-synth energy.\u201d The song overall plays upon the god\u2019s themes of being devious and rebelling against social norms.\nIn 2018, the Australian musical project Dead Can Dance released an album entitled Dionysus. Musician Brendan Perry described the inspiration for the album as a trance-like, \"Dionysian\" experience he had at a festival during a trip to rural Spain. \"It's the spring festivals like that one where you see the real remnants of Dionysian festivals. They're all over the Mediterranean in remote places where Christian influence hasn't been as great. ... People wear masks and dance in circles almost like time has stood still in their celebrations.\" Perry chose to employ Mediterranean folk instruments that mimic natural sounds in addition to a vocal chorus, in order to evoke the atmosphere of an ancient festival.In 2019, the South Korean boy band BTS released a rap-rock-synth-pop-hip-hop track.  named \"Dionysus\" as part of their album Map of the Soul: Persona. The naming of this song comes from the association of the namesake with debauchery and excess, this is reflected in its lyrics talking about \"getting drunk on art\" - playing on the Korean words for \"alcohol\" (\uc220 sul) and \"art\" (\uc608\uc220 yesul) as an example - alongside expressions about their stardom, legacy, and artistic integrity. The band's leader RM in a press release described the song as, \"the joy and pain of creating something\u201d and \u201can honest track\".\n\n\n== Parallels with Christianity ==\n\nNumerous scholars have compared narratives surrounding the Christian figure of Jesus with those associated with Dionysus.\n\n\n=== Death and resurrection ===\nSome scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-rising god mythological archetype. On the other hand, it has been noted that the details of Dionysus' death and rebirth are starkly different both in content and symbolism from Jesus. The two stories take place in very different historical and geographic contexts. Also, the manner of death is different; in the most common myth, Dionysus was torn to pieces and eaten by the titans, but \"eventually restored to a new life\" from the heart that was left over.\n\n\n=== Trial ===\nAnother parallel can be seen in The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate. However, a number of scholars dispute this parallel, since the confrontation between Dionysus and Pentheus ends with Pentheus dying, torn into pieces by the mad women, whereas the trial of Jesus ends with him being sentenced to death. The discrepancies between the two stories, including their resolutions, have led many scholars to regard the Dionysus story as radically different from the one about Jesus, except for the parallel of the arrest, which is a detail that appears in many biographies as well.\n\n\n=== Sacred food and drink ===\nOther elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.\n\n\n=== Other parallels ===\nE. Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict monotheism by the fouth century AD; together with Mithraism and other sects, the cult formed an instance of \"pagan monotheism\" in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late Antiquity. Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards, especially Gerard Vossius, also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus/Bacchus and Moses (Vossius named his sons Dionysius and Isaac). Such comparisons surface in details of paintings by Poussin.Tacitus, John the Lydian, and Cornelius Labeo all identify Yahweh with the Greek god Dionysus. Jews themselves frequently used symbols that were also associated with Dionysus such as kylixes, amphorae, leaves of ivy, and clusters of grapes. In his Quaestiones Convivales, the Greek writer Plutarch of Chaeronea writes that the Jews hail their god with cries of \"Euoi\" and \"Sabi\", phrases associated with the worship of Dionysus. According to Sean M. McDonough, Greek-speakers may have confused Aramaic words such as Sabbath, Alleluia, or even possibly some variant of the name Yahweh itself for more familiar terms associated with Dionysus.John Moles has argued that the Dionysian cult influenced early Christianity, and especially the way that Christians understood themselves as a \"new\" religion centered around a savior deity. In particular, he argues that the account of Christian origins in the Acts of the Apostles was heavily influenced by Euripides' The Bacchae. Moles also suggests that Paul the Apostle may have partially based his account of the Lord's Supper[1 Cor 11:23\u201326] on the ritual meals performed by members of the Dionysian cult.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAlpos and Nonnus\nApollonian and Dionysian\nAnthesteria, Ascolia, Dionysia and Lenaia\nBacchanalia and Liberalia\nDionysian Mysteries and Cult of Dionysus,\nMaenad, Thiasus, Thyrsus and Satyr\nPan (god), Ampelos, Cybele and Silenus\nLiber\nTheatre of Dionysus\nOrgia\nOrphism\nTheatre of Dionysus\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLivy, History of Rome, Book 39:13, Description of banned Bacchanalia in Rome and Italy\nDetienne, Marcel, Dionysos at Large, tr. by Arthur Goldhammer, Harvard University Press, 1989.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "A fantastic variety of fish and reptiles packed into a small area. If you are lucky, maybe a chance to handle the snakes or simply admire the turtle and other varieties of fish and reptiles. Inspiring to see the dedication and enthusiasm of the staff.",
          "Popped here as it was only a 10 minute walk from our accommodation. What a lovely visit. Staff were all lovely, it is only a small place and doesn't take long to see everything but take your time and don't be shy, hold and pet the lizards, snakes and tortoises. They encourage",

          "Wauw! Wonderful time at this place. We didn't expect it to be so beautiful. Many things to see, fantastic stories from the people who work there of all the animals they saved. Everyone gets a chance to even meet the creatures form really up close. Hidden pearl, must do for",
          "Visited here a few days ago, with 6 year old and 12 year old. Staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the reptiles and snakes. Encouraged kids to hold snakes, etc which they loved. As all other reviews state, it's small but the interaction with the reptiles etc makes it",

          "This place is beyond fantastic and a must see while in Crete. No matter where you\u2019re staying on the island, it\u2019s well worth the drive. For starters, It\u2019s the most spotlessly clean aquarium I\u2019ve ever seen. Crystal clear waters and bright, clean habitats. You can tell each and",

          "If you rescue animals we really like it. But the aquarium looked kind of strange to us. Why didn\u2019t the fishes & octopusses have any plants in their small looking bassins? And the little garden was kind of disturbing. The poor turtle running between the visitors, who took selfies",
          "Wow, hard to find something to say that I haven\u2019t already read in the reviews. The staff are an inspiration, especially Elleni (hope I\u2019ve spelt that right!) and Joe. Their knowledge and dedication is infectious. They handle their charges and their visitors with an impressive",
          "This is a tiny sanctuary of local sealife and exotics run by real wildlife lovers. You only need an hour or two but the staff are extremely friendly and it\u2019s a real hands on experience which the kids loved. Well worth a visit. Watch out for the zooming tortoise!",
          "If you have been swimming in the sea and have been struggling to see, let alone identify the local marine life then head to Aquaworld where you can get up close instead. If you have ever been to a SeaLife centre in the UK and been bored by being carried along in an endless",

          "We really liked our vist. The place is small, but there are a lot of different animals there. The guide was wonderful and we saw the morning feeding with commentaries. You also could hold ad touch a lot of the reptiles, that was really wonderful.",
          "When we turned up we thought it looked like someone had started an Aquarium in their house but once you were inside it was actually very good! There were quite a few tanks with lots of fish and crustaceans in. Out the back they had lizards and snakes and people stood around so",
          "Got there just as some of the fish were being fed their breakfast. Bob, the octopus, was particularly impressive in gaining access to his food. After that you were given the opportunity to interact with the snake and/or iguanas. It was quite busy so was always a bit late wary",
          "Great little wildlife rescue centre, worth the money just to see the tortoise shoving people out the way with attitude lol! Can interact with some of the reptiles, got to hold a reticulated python which was great. Also some interesting fish in the aquariums and a blind sea",
          "Visited Aquaworld during our holidays. It is great to see what John as done since our last visit. Stephanie the sea turtle looks well even if she cannot return to the see. With new staff and new additions, whether it's reptiles or marine life. There is always something new or",

          "\u20ac8 entrance fee and well worth it knowing the money was going to the upkeep of a brilliant little rescue centre.",
          "Very lovely place with interesting sea creatures. It could be even better and include some other species too that can attract even more people!",
          "Unexpectedly located in a building which was, perhaps, once a house, Aquaworld is not large but the \u20ac8 entrance is worth every cent for the beauty inside. The tanks are very interesting and the reptiles equally so. I held the most beautiful bearded dragon but could not wait for",
          "My wife spotted an advert for Aquaworld at our hotel and as it was only down the road we thought we\u2019d take a look. I didn\u2019t have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. I think it was John who greeted us on arrival and explained that most of the fish and reptiles at",
          "After visiting here previously on a different holiday, we made a point of returning again because we enjoyed it so much before. It\u2019s \u20ac8 entrance (adults) and isn\u2019t a massive place, please remember this is a charity and the people here do good work. There isn\u2019t a cafe, toilets",
          "We had so much fun during our visit. The centre is very small but has a nice variety of fish, some really unusual ones! The reptiles are the highlight, they are obviously cared for and the staff seemed really passionate about them. There is a particularly horny, very large",
          "Stuff was very polite, a lot of beautiful animals. You can pet them and take a photo with them. Price is not high and you can also donate some money for the animals. They have sea animals and some snakes and a few lizards. It was a nice experince.",
          "Don\u2019t go here expecting a sealife centre or somewhere similar. This is a small place so don\u2019t expect to be there all afternoon. What you do get is great. The aquarium part is decent, but small, but the real draw is the reptile section where you can hold the snakes and lizards",
          "Wow! This place was mind blowing, only small but mind blowing. The lengths they go to help these animals are crazy, with many of them getting looked after before they\u2019ll eventually get released. You can hold many of the reptiles which I must say are beautiful little creatures.",
          "It is not very big, but there are a lot of animals. We didn't expect the amount and variation of animals. There were big fish, a sea turtle, several sea stars and octopus. The repile garden was nice. You can hold snakes and other repiles. Blondie, the big turtle walks around",

          "What a fantastic afternoon for us and the children. Both my boys are fascinated by reptiles and they were not disappointed here, we stayed for around 2hrs and in that time they held snakes and lizards and watched an octopus swim. They were both very impressed and it will be",

          "A beautiful little aquarium. My kids loved it as it was interactive & the staff were so knowledgeable & passionate about what they do. We all got to hold all types of reptile & we even had them walking between our feet! Conservation is important to them & they had great stories",

          "We visit the location as a 'thing to do' in Hersonissos and we really enjoy it. For the reptilarium, there were turtles and iguanas outside to pet them or to get close. The staff is amazing. They had 2 snakes today for the brave ones to hold and take a photo or 2.",
          "For 8 euros it's too small, maybe price could be 2-3 eur, but not 8 eur. Nothing special there......",

          "We went to aqua world with our 11 and 9 year old daughters. It's a small but very friendly place. Everybody was called through to the reptile centre to see them have breakfast. We all loved this especially seeing Oscar the bearded dragon. We then went through to see the sea",
          "What an amazing find. Friendly staff telling you about the animals that they have rescued. Hands on experiences are encouraged as are photos. It\u2019s only small but well worth the \u20ac8 entry when this money helps keep there centre up and running. Amazing job being done by the team",
          "This is a tiny almost hidden aquaworld along the shopping street. But it really worth to go in! Interesting underwater animals in good condition aquariums and reptiles outside which you can even hold if you want to. The octopus is so cute.",
          "We were staying in the area and thought we would pop along to see what they had to offer, the place is very easy to find and the entry cost is very reasonable (8 euros) plus the staff are all really friendly. Although the place itself is quite small, there is quite a bit jammed",

          "We visited Aquaworld at the beginning of our holiday, and loved it so much we came back before we went home. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about the animals in their care. We held every snake and lizard in the garden, watched the blind turtle being hand",
          "Visited the Aquaworld as a last resort as we had little left to do. Certainly wasn't disappointed! The staff were excellent and really friendly, they were certainly willing to go the extra mile to share information about the animals! You can also hold several of the reptiles",
          "I found Aquaworld on the map as it was very close to my hotel, a nice small Aquatic centre with many tanks full of all kinds of marine life. A great place to spend an hour especially if you have a few kids to entertain. The staff are helpful and welcoming and will answer any",
          "A small aquarium that is a rescue centre, the man was English who I think owned it, a lovely man, interesting to see, only about an hour of your time but worth I visit I think. They allow you to touch the snakes/reptiles etc kids would love it.",
          "Looks small from the outside but it\u2019s packed with information. You can get in close contact with some of the animals, watch them getting feed while they are moving around freely. The staff is really dedicated to the cause and full of knowledge. Definitely worth a visit",
          "I spent a lot of time reading about all the amazing things they do here, rescuing animals etc. which is fantastic. However when we went outside to the reptile section it was so busy we could hardly move, not entirely sure how they could overcome this but we felt a bit bad",
          "Visited with grandchildren. Really busy in morning when just open. Watched octopus being fed then held snakes round my neck. Grandaughter held a rock python. Grandson ran! Only small but well worth a visit.",
          "We returned to Aquaworld after visiting in 2016, it\u2019s such a fantastic place and the work the staff do is just incredible. The staff were so knowledgeable about the species and happy to tell the stories of how the animals were rescued. It is a small aquarium/reptile centre but",
          "We visited here with our two young kids to pass a cloudy day in Crete, and I\u2019m so glad we did! Whilst the entrance fee seems a little steep (\u20ac24) on first impressions for a few tanks of sea life, the real treats are further back. The aquarium has a courtyard where you can get up",
          "Visited here on a cloudy day in Crete. \u00a38 entry for adults very worth the cost as it goes towards the great work the people here are doing for these animals. All animals here are rescue animals or those injured and in need of care. A quaint aquarium with a range of fish",
          "Had the privilege to revisit here today and see johns work still ongoing such a great place to visit an absolute must I\u2019ve never heard or met someone so caring for conservation and that lets you get first hand with handling animal with ease. Me and my family love this place.",
          "I had a great time here. I loved the history behind the aquarium and all it stood for. The staff will gladly answer any questions about the animals. It is also international, with info about the animals in many languages. My only complaint is that some of the staff members",
          "A fascinating rescue centre with very friendly staff and lovely animals. My husband held a huge python and my daughter's held snakes and lizards. A really great time.",
          "I liked the staff, they are really nice people and made from a person who hates and is really afraid of snakes, in one who is watching with calm and acceptance these reptiles. And I am grateful for that. They are doing a great job and inspired me to have another perspective",
          "We had seen this place had great reviews on trip advisor so visited one day whilst it was cloudy. It\u2019s smaller than I thought but full of interesting animals and you can get as close as you want. I got to hold 3 lizards all at the same time and also hold a large python.",
          "I'd recommend visiting here. It's not very big but neither is the price. The people are extremely friendly and they have some nice animals which you can hold.",
          "Just an amazing place to visit - it is so entertaining that you can't leave. Just go and you will not regret, i guarantee.",
          "We visited Aquaworld with my husband and son. Small place BUT really it is worth to be visited. A lot of interesting facts you can read and hear from the staff. Also you can touch quite nice reptiles and make photos with them. My son loved everybody there, did not want to leave",
          "This is a fantastic way to spend a few hours in Hersonissos. We went around 10:30am, which was perfect as it seemed to be feeding time. There is an outside area, where they had all the snakes and lizards out which you could hold and touch. Then they also had an inside area with",
          "It may not seem so great from the outside, but when you meet the owners you can know right away that it's a great place to visit. Our son just loved all those lizards, turtles and snakes, even he was 2 at the time. I can recommend that place especially for families with kids, it",
          "The rescue center was quite fun, we got to interact with some reptiles, which was the first for us, and see various crabs and fishes. The staff was also quite nice. One negative, if i were to think of one would be that is a little to small. I would like it to be bigger and",
          "This is a great place to visit, if you go early afternoon they get all the snakes & lizards out & you can hold them & learn about the individual animals. As it\u2019s only a small family run attraction you get to feel a real connection with the animals & the people who own this.",
          "My wife and I visited Aquaworld on a short holiday to Crete recently. We had a really great time meeting and handling the various reptiles and looking at the fish. Whilst this is a small attraction to visit it is definitely worth a visit purely based on the lovely and",
          "Visited here with my fella first thing in the morning. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff who told us that it was feeding time in the garden. The price is \u20ac8 each for adults; although the aquarium is small there is a lot of interesting info on the walls to",
          "A must go place! A fantastic place to spend an hour. You can see all the local fish you see in the local sea in the aquariums. Plus watch Ollie the octopus take the top off a bottle to get his dinner. Outside are all the reptiles. It's very hands on. You can handle all the",
          "Me and my boyfriend visited last week for my 21st birthday and it was amazing, the reptiles were great to see and the staff were also very friendly. As soon as you walk in you know that the staff love their animals and its so great to see! Highly recommended for couples,",
          "A small reptile and sealife rescue centre, suitable to pass on an hour or so for younger kids. My son is 6 and he loved this place. The owners look after rescued reptiles and sealife and are hugely knowledgeable about the animals/ fish. An educational experience that will",
          "The dedication of the British founder and local staff at this little rescue center is beautiful to behold. We learned so much about different lizards, snakes, and sea life in a short visit to this sanctuary, by reading and hearing about their individual stories and by petting",
          "We visited here today and all the staff we encountered were friendly and knowledgable with the animals and fish they keep. They are telling you information as you observe the animals. You are able to watch the feeding times of the different creatures. We saw the turtle and",
          "A nice but small aquarium (about 20 tanks) but with a lot of snakes and dragons outside. Nice staff, although it seems sometimes odd when (one of the members) you want to \"bite\" and playing around with the animals. A little much more respect is on his place. Further, it was",
          "Well worth a visit most of the reptiles are rescued and are kept as near as possible to their natural environment.",
          "Great place to visit if you have a spare hour or two. Small centre but a great vibe and more one to one then other centres. If you like none furry animals this is the place for you. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "It's amazing We had a great time and they also have snakees and lizards It's kinda like a really small zoo",
          "We visited here for something different to do and we were not disappointed! The staff here really know their stuff and are very passionate about what they do, plenty to see and to learn and we were never bored. It is a really great thing they are doing with the animals, all of",
          "Small aquarium and reptile centre, but well worth the small entrance fee. The acquarium has a good variety local marine life, and the centre works with local agencies to rehabilitate some of the animals back into the wild. The reptile area was hands on, and staff were very",
          "Can\u2019t recommend this place enough - it\u2019s small and very much put together on a budget, but it\u2019s clear the staff love their animals and are so enthusiastic about telling you about them. You get the opportunity to hold some snakes and can see the tortoises and lizards they\u2019ve",

          "What a delight to hold snakes and a variety of friendly reptiles who were so well cared for and happy to sit on your hands in the sun. The passion for the animals who have all been rescued was contagious. Little squirt the 12 year old iguana wanders around but loves to be",
          "The place is small, but the animals are well cared for. You get to hold the animals to do pictures. Staff were very good and knowledgable about the animals they have. Recommend going first thing in the morning (opens at 10am) for feeding time. Please leave a donation, these",
          "Me and my partner spotted Aquaworld while walking through the town and visiting the shops. It's not difficult to get to and it's very easy to find. When we stepped inside we didn't realise just how small it actually was. While queing for a ticket it was very cramped and no-one",
          "Small, but beautifully marked. This was set up as a rescue place for unwanted (etc.) pets, in what was originally a house, by a Brit. All but a few of the marine animals are from local waters. We were encouraged to go first to the \u201cgarden\u201d area, which holds tortoises, terrapins,",
          "My girlfriend and i visited this place during our 2 week holiday in Crete, there was a fairly large array of animals to see and to be able to hold the reptiles was a delight. The staff there were very friendly and there was some magnificent creatures. We only paid \u20ac8 each which",

          "This is the really the best small zoo with reptiles and fish we have visited in Europe. My 7 and 9 y old kids have seen and touched snakes and amphibious beast before..... but never a 8 kg anaconda or a 50 cm lizard. Great for an hour or 2 visit.",
          "We had a great time here, tucked away behind the supermarket it's a hidden treasure. The staff are very knowledgeable and happy to tell you about the fish they have rescued and given home's, they have a real passion for what they do and would recommend 100% interestingly they",
          "Our group planned to visit the centre as many of them are avid animal lovers. We did not know what to expect so we read the reviews. I will admit, the facility was smaller than I had expected, but so much better than the reviews I had read! The staff were tremendous! They were",

          "great place to visit for a family trip , you can see lots of see animals , snakes , turtles , lizards .",
          "I love this place, because it\u2019s unique. I don\u2019t like how some places capture animals from their habitats, but this place is the opposite, they help animals and dedicate a lot of time in their lives to help them out when they are injured or need looking after. Also, in most",
          "True that it's small but it's loads of fun!! They have a nice assortment of sea animals including octopus and a sea turtle that the owner has hand fed every day for 18 years. Pretty cool how a lot of the animals there are rescues, the real fun comes in the back when you get to",
          "Returned here after a visit 5 years ago, this time with my baby doughter. It is great to see how the staff still have same level of motivation to care for the animals as well as teaching all visitors as if they where the very first. As can be expected, they appreciate not",

          "As mentioned before, it's not the usual aquarium, and the fish tanks are not the main reason for visit the lovely place. to my opinion the main attraction is the courtyard with all the reptiles, that you can touch and hold, and the guides are really nice and helpful. I think you",
          "If you are looking for a traditional big aquarium, this is not the place for you. But what this place does offer is owners and their staffs' love for animals and you WILL be able to get close with the animals. The gentleman running the aquarium built everything himself",
          "John the owner was so friendly and helpful, the kids loved it so much. My kid was very scared at first but John was so patient with him and after 10 min he started touching and holding the reptiles.",
          "I visited this place for the 3rd time last summer. I absolutely love this place! It is fascinating hearing the stories from the staff about how all of the reptiles have been rescued and looked after since arriving at the acquarium. It is such a relaxed friendly atmosphere there",

          "This is a relatively small place but the enthusiasm of the staff and range of animals makes it well worth a visit. Because it is relatively small you can get up close to the animals and in the case of the reptiles touch and handle them. If you are interested in fish and reptiles",
          "was welcomed here and totally enjoyed all the experience, yes its a little small inside but we went in October so it wasn't packed and got to talk one to one to staff and hold every single reptile.we spent a good couple of hours here, I signed in the visiting book also, great",

          "Visited today, absolutely lovely place. Small with a garden at the back. The owners work really hard to keep the place going. In the garden outside you can handle most of their reptiles and talk to the owners about what they do. This is not a large aquarium but it is worth more",

          "Paid \u20ac16 for two of us to visit this \"aquarium\" after seeing its 5* rating on trip advisor. I was prepared for it to be small but thought it was worth the visit. \"Aquaworld\" is best described as a rescue centre and not an aquarium. It is essentially the first floor of a house",

Dinosaur models are displayed along an approximately 500 metres (1,600 ft) long walk, each accompanied by an information board.\nThe Dinosauria Park started as an idea in 2013 and was first housed in Gournes \u0394ekk, located in the former American base. It displayed 30 different dinosaur species from all periods of the Mesozoic era and other prehistoric animals.\nIn 2014 the exhibits were transferred to their own space, in which they were displayed in what would have been their natural environment. New species of dinosaurs were added, along with new sections, such as a \"dinosaur hospital\", depicting the hatching of a dinosaur egg. A \"5D\" cinema screen shows films to visitors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dinosaur parks\nCretaquarium\n\n\n== External links ==\nDinosauria Park",

          "It is too expensive for what you can get... My 3years old child pay ticket as well while in aquarium did not. Children up to 8-9years old may find interesting... However it is not so much interesting for the adults.",
          "Many puppets of dino's, some robotics and move their necks/mouth/tails. A semi museum and few extra activities for extra charge. We only tried the 5D movie- the kids loved it. Without the extra activities it's about 45mins tour. Nice place, but not must see.",
          "Visited with my husband & 10 & 3yr old boys. 3yr old is absolutely obsessed with dinosaurs so naturally he loved seeing them all. Was very hot not a great deal in the shade but enough. The cinema was good fun we all enjoyed that although the chairs were quite jumpy. Nice little",
          "Park was very small and not that busy so very easy to get around and take great photos! Dinosaur models are great and the ones that love are a nice touch. We got an all in ticket which was 20 Euros each which gave us access to everything. It was not really worth it so if you do",
          "Outdated place, the \u201c5D, sometines referred as 7D, cinema experience (what\u2019s in a name??) was very very outdated and even a horrible experience compared what\u2019s possible today. The movements of the seats didn\u2019t match with the motions on screen. The seats from my neighbour did",

          "26 eur for adult and 2 kids to see rubber dinosaurs its too much. Place itself Was boring and even my kids were complaining. One plus; you may have nice pictures...",

          "The park is fun for kids and it\u2019s worth the ticket price advertised on the homepage. But that is not the price they charge. The tickets office tries to sell a \u201csuper ticket\u201d at 10 EUR more per person. It grants access to \u201cplanterium\u201d and other things. Normally you would think",

          "Very nice park. We have bought full ticket. Lot of space, not crowded, many things to do, compared with similar ones. Kids loved VR movies. Helpful staff, thanks for helping us buying a very wanted toy. The 5d experience was not as interesting as expected.",
          "Went there with 2 kids of 4 and 6. They really enjoyed the dinosaurs and the park. We spent maybe 2-2 1/2 hours it was a hot day so the park was not busy and we parked in front of the entrance. Dinosaurs had information signs in different languages so the adults could learn",

          "A very good effort with larger-than-life automatrons and wonderful people welcoming tourists. However, the prices are too high for Crete - perhaps not so for tourists, but overall, if you are used to the rest of the island, not worth it. I liked the 4D experience, the natural",
          "Good for little childrens. You will see moving dinosaurs and roaring (not all working). The place is very clean and well maintained. at the end there is a playground for the little ones. We went there with a 3 years old girl and she enjoyd the place. 10 euro for adult the girl",

          "Went there with my kids, 2 and 4. They really liked it and enjoyed it. The dinos are really plastiky, small movements, some roars. We were done in an hour. Nice playground at the end. I recommend it on a rainy day.",

          "We visited this park on the basic price of 10 euros per person and slightly reduced price for children. You had to pay more for the virtual stuff. Its poor,small, old fashioned and you have to stretch it out to spend more than an hour if you dont pay the full price for the",

          "Visited with 2 young children, perfect for a afternoon out, lots of dinosaurs to look at and info in a range of lanuages. Dino hospital is a fun break from the heat. 2 sand pit for the kids, snack bar and good priced resturant. 5d cinima, scince area and planterium all extra",

          "We were excited about this park but it was a huge disappointment for all of us - even for our 6 -year-old. 5D movies and the film shown in Planetarium (for extra fee!!) are of the '80s including the theatre's poor infrastructure. Boring, smelly, very retro... This park isn't",
          "Dinosauria is one of those little hidden gems you genuinely (to my knowledge) can't find anywhere else in the world. Yes, it's animatronics, and yes, it's obviously fake, but kids either can't tell, or at the very least it is awesome to get a real-life scale of what these",
          "It is one of the must see place with the kids once you are in Crete. It was actually better than excepted. Parking wasn\u2019t an issue, easy access, easy to find it. There are some gentle warnings to not take drink or food inside the park. Don\u2019t worry, there are places you can have",
          "We had high hopes for this place and the reviews were good, whether they have changed the pricing structure recently I\u2019m not sure. Entry was just under \u20ac30 for 2 adult and 1 child. There is about 30 minutes of dinosaur content. The planetarium looked good until we were stopped",
          "Really enjoyed visiting this place. Did not expect it to be so big and definitely did not expect the planetarium and science parts to be included. This is great for young children and a great place to spend a couple of hours.",
          "The dinosaurs replicas aren't always so accurate but the small kids will love it, small movements and noises from almost all dinosaurs. You will see almost all kinds of dinosaurs. In the same place there is also planetarium. The tickets prices isn't cheap but what you can do!",
          "Me, mu husband and two young daughters ( 4 & 6) visited this park and had a really fun time . My 6 year old especially was asking lots of questions about each dinosaur. The way the park is organized is very fun but its not very active. My guess is that older kids will be bored",
          "Went here to kill some time with our 2 kids. 2 and 6. Very well equipped with lots of large dinosaurs and information. Not too expensive either. The cinema experiences are extra and not suitable for my 2 year old but we're informed of this at the reception desk. Overall we spent",
          "Went to dino park today and we have a 4 & 6 year old. Very expensive for what it is, cinema is also extra money which we paid for the 5d experience for the kids was probably the best bit in my opinion. The planetarium is also an extra cost which I refused to pay as it was a",

We\u2019d read the mixed reviews on here but decided to give it a chance as our son is Dino crazy so thought he\u2019d like it even if not so great. We needn\u2019t have worried, it was a fantastic place, great dinosaurs, well maintained and in",
          "As a ten yr old girl I was disappointed .I think it is for little children. I think it would be best for 7 or under the planetarium is closed every weekday so if interested go different day",
          "Quite fun. Some of the dinosaurs which were supposed to be moving didn't. But nice stroll around in a sunny day. Close to the Cretaquarium so can visit them both.",
          "Travelled to Crete in May and this was one of our great days out. Grandson ( age 3)has talked about this ever since. Nice mixture of Dinosaurs well placed within the park.The Aquarium is close by so we visited it on the same day. Great value for money.",
          "Was quite disappointed with the place to be honest few good points and parts but mostly disappointing I wouldn't go back in a rush to be honest most of the dinosaurs are rubber and look nothing like there meant to like I said a few do the cinema was very disappointingly the",
          "Even though we were there in May it already felt too hot and lacked shade for children. Loved the Dino hospital excursion, fun and interactive. You will spend around 2-3 hours there. Collect stamps during the walk and the kid will get a medal and a certificate at the end.",
          "Very impressive place with really big dinosaurs of all kind,my kids loved the place. We spent 2 hours and it was great",
          "Great day out for the our boys (age 2 and 4) - so much to see and do. They loved all the different experiences ranging from life size dinosaur statues, treasure hunt, games, activity centre.",
          "Visited when it was a rainy day, it\u2019s ok nothing to go nuts about. Some big dinosaurs which the kid liked, but he got bored easily. Not much to do to be honest but what can you do really? Passed a couple of hours.",
          "There are a lot of moving and growling dinos, nice park and a playground in the end. But be prepared that if your child is not a dino fan than he/she might not be impressed...",
          "Fantastic well laid out park filled with moving dinosaurs. Lots for the kids to see. Fun day out and educational. Few sand pits for the kids to play in and a playground. Really enjoyed it",
          "We went on the off chance with our 2 year son, who is Dinosaur crazy! I have to say we were pleasantly suprised at how much there was to see and do for children. It cost us \u20ac10 each with children under 3 going for free and was well worth it. The staff were so friendly and",
          "We decided to visit Dinosauria and to be honest we didn't think it would be that good. How wrong we were! Lots of large dinosaurs and facts, a dinosaur hospital tour - fab for kids. A large sand pit to find dinosaur bones and best of all 5D cinema experience. You have to pay an",
          "Not far from cretaquarium. Mainly outdoor with moving dinosaurs. Great for kids. Informative and fun. Adult Ticket: \u20ac10 Child Ticket (4 -12): \u20ac8 Child under 4: FREE Disabled Adult: FREE Disabled Child: FREE",
          "Very good fun for the kids (4 and 6) to run around and seen the Dinosaur's some are animated. The kids chalange is fun trying to find the 6 specific items / Dinosaur's. There is a planetarium there that is also very good (I would say that I work I the space industry) but it is",
          "It is a nice park for children with a lot of dinosaur models which growl and move a bit. Quite some information about different dinosaurs. There is one animation: dino-hospital - every half-an-hour. There is also a game for kids to collect the dino-stamps and finally get some",
          "A nice park with lots of dinosaurs. Very entertaining for the kids. The dinosaurs with motion and sound as well as dinosaur hospital are impressive. We skipped both 5 and 7D cinemas and bought Planetarium tickets for an extra charge and were very happy we did. Equipped with the",
          "My son is 3 and obsessed with Dinosaurs so this place was right up his alley ! Life size ( so I think) animated dinosaurs with their names history and origin , a huge playground and a restaurant. If you have daughters i dont really think they would like this place may even get",
          "I took my 7 and 11 year old and they loved it. Large dinosaurs that move and roar as you go past (not scary, would say suitable for very young children also.) lots to see. 7d cinema great (at a small extra cost). You watch 2 short films (about 15 mins), one about dinosaurs and",
          "We visited this park during our holiday and the park was ok, the kids enjoyed it. It was a bit disappointing that we were only in there about 2 hours as kids started to get a bit bored. But for a few hours trip it's not bad",
          "saw this on the reviews before i came to gouves on holiday and really wanted to see it, we visited on the way from just leaving the cretaquarium that was about 20 mins walk from there so its not far, we payed 28 euro for two adults and one teenager, its very good you go through",
          "The dinosaurs are in all kind of sizes from small to very tall and big. Its great adventure fir the kids. The dinosaurs are moving and making sounds and even they got a medical clinic to heal all the sick dinos. We have been there few hours. And you can combine it with",
          "A very big Park with lots of dinosaurs with movement and sound. There are so many activities the kids can enjoy... Excavation places, 4d cinema,playgrounds and so much more!!! Don't miss it!",
          "It is a nice place to visit with kids; we visited Dinosauria with our 3 years old child who enjoyed seeing all the dinosaurs and who loved this experience. The entrance fee is 10euro for an adult and it would have been 13 for adult if we decided to go to the 5d + 7d cinema but",
          "Great place, we were also impressed with the planetarium that was within the park. We spent about 2.5 hours here, play park for children and also a 5D cinema. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Entrance is to expensive. 10 for adult 8 for child. For really small kids its okay, but not above 4 years old. If you want to see the 4d movie or see/do other things you have to Pay extra.",
          "Nice day out of if you have young children. The play area is particularly good, with a nice shaded area for drinks while the children play.",
          "Having read other reviews,both positive and not so positive we decided to give this a visit, 5 of us 2 adults 1 teenager and 2 younger ones, the cost was about 38 euros, and 38 euros we felt we completely wasted You take a very short walk around a small 'park' going inside a",
          "It was ok but couldn't stay there for hours. Felt at 10 euros it was a bit pricey then they wanted 6 euros for planetarium so we didn't do it. We didn't mind the 3 euros for the 7d ride as it was quite fun. If the park was bigger it might have been a bit better. I did enjoy it",
          "My 7 and 4 year old loved it... was pleasant enough for us to watch them and walk it through with them.",
          "We took our two children and they loved Dinosauria! It was the perfect break from sun and sand for the afternoon.",

          "As the title says, I wasn't expecting much, but really enjoyed this place, my only con here was the man who worked in the cafe,, I asked for change of a 2\u20accoin for one of the many 1\u20ac rides dotted along the place, he told me he had none,yet a second later my oldest son bought a",
          "We liked this park very interesting And our daughters liked it. We also liked the 5D cinema experience",
          "Great wee day out for the kids. Plenty of dinos on show with museum and hospital area. Not a huge park but but a good visit as the kids will spend time getting their face painted for free and staring in awe at some of the bigger dinos on display. Most dinos move their heads,",

          "Came here as a family of four, one dinosaur mad four year old. This place is amazing. We got the bus from our hotel here and it was easy and straightforward. About \u20ac36 for the four of us to get in. Loads of dinosaurs, all with moving parts and sounds. True to size so some",
          "This is a great place to visit with the grand children they love it and its their second visit in 2 years.",

          "If you have young children that are dinosaur mad then this might be a good choice. We have a 3 year old who likes dinosaur related things like this but this place didn't exactly hit the right notes. She did however enjoy the sand pit and water feature that's there. The cinema",
          "Had a good time here with 2 children aged 4 & 5, they enjoyed digging for dinosaur bones and the 5 D cinema was good. Only complaint was they had no ice cream for sale, but we had a slushy instead. Good value for money",
          "We went as the weather was a bit overcast, and It was better than I expected, great museum and exhibits, my 5 year old loved it, especially digging for bones and holding dino eggs! You don't need much time there but very worth while.",
          "7 and 9 years old very much enjoyed their trip back in time! Moving and roaring dinos, with a 3d cinma on site (but atnan additional \u20ac3 per person) and a lovely cafe and play area at the end.",
          "We visited on a Monday and it was \u20ac28 for two adults and a six year old. This place is great if you have a dinosaur lover! It starts with bones/fossils and proceeds outside to where there are many life sized moving dinosaurs. There was even an indoor maternity/hospital for",
          "its ok for the kids , some of the staff are friendly others however seem bored and the food at the snack bar is below average. They could make a bit of an efford because a lot of families buy snack there. The excibits are cool and the area is well organised and clean. Found the",
          "Me, my husband and 2.5 year old daughter visited the park one morning when the weather was not nice enough for a beach day. It is 1@ euros for adults and free under 4. BUT! You have to pay extra for the cinema inside the park and what I found really annoying is the play park at",
          "Definitely worth a visit was awesome so much to see. highly recommend , very good price so much to see. Kids can dig for dinosaur bones, and go in 5D cinema which is wow well worth the 3euros. We had a great time and souvenirs are a good price,really good value for money, well",
          "Went there on one cloudy day to kill time with 3 young kids. Not the biggest of parks, Don't expect to spend the whole day there. Dino exhibits are good for young children, Dino hospital was also quite good, the kids enjoyed this, there is also a few areas where kids can dig",
          "We had a 4 y old who was a bit unsure if the animals were for real or not and was afraid at first, but then figured out that they are not for real. We didn't go to the 5 D cinema there bc were afraid he would then for sure think they are for real. But a bit older kids it",
          "Took 4 grandchildren here for a visit. 2 boys aged 4yrs and 2 girls aged nearly 2yrs loved this place. Lots of wonderful dinosaur models that move and make lots of noise - just perfect to keep kids happy and entertained. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Average place to visit...dinosaurs..restaurant shop playground...compare to other Dino Parks in Europe ..nothing new.You have to pay extra for cinema. Restaurant food good. I had a feeling that I am in a ghost town...not only Dinosauria but a whole town was like that.",

          "My little boy absolutely loved it here. Lots for the kids to see and do. A fantastic day Out for all the family.",
          "As the parent of a dinosaur fanatic, I earned some major brownie points finding this place near our hotel! This is a must if you have children aged 3 and up and makes a difference to the normal water park days. The theme park itself isn't overly expensive for entry (though",
          "Is an interesting exhibition, my kids were really excited!! It is not very big the 4D experience was really nice. for sure we will go again",
          "A great and most enjoyable day out if you have a child who loves Dinosaurs..A perfect environment for a Dinosaur Park..with lots for children to see and do specially in the height of season, we went here in October so a few of the things to do were closed, but we still had a",

          "A very good place to visit with kids. 50 full size moving and roaring dinosaurs. Even has a hospital and cryo unit for the eggs. 7D movie room with a play area as you come out. Would definitely recommend this for a day out.",
          "Went with my 3yr old daughter and i think its just ideal for the kids to explore and learn. A nice playground also at the end of the park. Friendly staff, very clean place. For a group of adults of family with teens it may seem like not much of a deal but yougn kids speak about",
          "took my 1 year old and 6 year old along for the day. the both had a great time walking past the big dinosaurs which move and roar as you pass them. also has a nice playpark and a 5d cinema and also a virtual reality headset machine . the sand pit area is cool as it has fossils",
          "Took the grandkids in June, great place with lots of dinosaurs, spotlessly clean. We went during a heatwave so was very hot. Kids loved it and no doubt when we're back in June 2017 we'll be visiting again but will be worth it.",
          "We went with our 4 year old son. He likes it very much, but there is nothing attractive about it. The dinos are well done, but moving only a few, there is no plan of what the park wants to do, there is no the main idea. I thnik it is absolutely brilliant for younger children.",
          "Visited in October with my 6 year old son. He has Autism and loves Dinosaurs. Was very quiet. It was \u20ac18 for the 2 of us. I assumed this included the 5d cinema once inside but it didnt. That was a further \u20ac6 bit naughty really when they sell it as part of the park and a lady",

          "Although we'd agree with some of the earlier comments about the detail/ quality of the models, it is really aimed at small kids and overall it is a great place for little kids who love Dino's. Reasonable value at \u20ac10 per adult with the kids going free, it has large area under",
          "Went here with my husband and granddaughter in 2015. We had a great day out, with plenty to do and see. Gift shop , eatery and 5D cinema as well as some great robotic displays (and it's not too pricey either). Going back to Crete in a couple of weeks and we'll certainly be",
          "Everybody was telling us that this was an attraction for children. We have been really surprised, the park is really well done and nice to walk in it. I totally recommend it",
          "A lovely way to spend an afternoon with kids. Robotic dinosaurs with detailed description in four languages makes it interesting not just kids but adults as well. We did not join the virtual reality cinema as our kids were getting tired, but I guess it was fun. Entrance ticket",

          "Dinosauriapark is close to Cretaquarium, so both sites make up for a nice half-a-day quality time with your family. It's better to start in the morning with the dinos, as you'll spend more time outdoors and the sun is not that intense. While they look OK from the distance (thus",
          "really liked it here great for kids book your tickets in advance and save money also take the bus it does work out a lot cheaper",
          "Lots of fun activities for children of all ages. Perfect for a hot summers day as there is plenty of indoor activities and shade to shelter from the beautiful Greek sun.",
          "A medium size exhibition of dinosaurs (plastic skelton's, don't tell the kids) within the center. You are then ushered outside where they have life size robotic dinosaurs which move and roar at your children. You move onto the Dinosaur Hospital (looks like a scene from the",
          "The park is what we'd expected dinosaur models and exhibits. As parents of a 6 year old and 18month old it was a great way to pass the morning. Entry fees were reasonable and parking onsite. There was a good selection of dinosaur displays, a play park at the end of the exhibits",
          "A nice axhibition of dinosauruses. Also a 3D moovie. Our kids enjoyed the park and the moovie. Friendly stuff.",
          "it's worth a visit, They exposed different types of dinosaurs in they real size (they are huge). They also have 3D, 5D, 7D short movies about dinosaurus. At exit you can found a 9D where you can pick up a video (not necessarily about dinosaurus ). The D movies are not included",
          "If you want to see sun faded plastic model dinosaurs with unnatural movements to poor sound effects then this is the place for you. One water feature had the dead leaves in the bottom as an attraction, another a square box in the water saying 'do not touch'. They charge extra",
          "Very nicely presented place with dinosaur bones, eggs and models scattered around the park. Needs a bit more stuff in terms of interaction for the kids. Didn't go to the 4/5d cinema as didn't think it was fair having to pay more for it. Food at the canteen was acceptable, good",
          "Good for children, mainly for children. As far as I am aware there were never dinosaurs roaming Crete but there is plenty to see and do. The life size dinosaurs are animated complete with sounds. There are also virtual reality 'cinemas'. Takes about 2 hours to get round with",
          "Who: 3 adults, 3 young kids ages 2 to 6 The park is great Dinosaurs move their body parts and make noise. All in actual Dino size! Staff is so friendly Perfect for young kids. Probably not too interesting for older kids, say 12-13y/o",
          "For an adult, this theme park is somewhat poor, considering the quality of exhibited dinos, but as I recognised, young children (almost all of them within the theme park) were just fascinated by the attraction. And what else matters????",
          "This was a great excursion for our two boys aged 10 and 7 who love dinosaurs. They loved the 5D cinema and VR activities. The sound effects on the dinosaurs were a great addition to remind us that a long time ago these creatures were the ones roaming on this earth.",
          "We spent 2 hrs at the park and went to the 3d cinema which was extra. Drinks and icecream were resonable",
          "We went with my 4 yo son who was very excited. It is very well build and there are lot of things to see. The visit can take 15-20 minutes or more of you use the educational rooms. At the end of the exhibition there is a playgground where I think my son had more fun and me and my",
          "Dinosauria is a good idea and seems to be fairly well executed. Some of the dinosaurs are very lifelike and very impressive although the animatronics in some seemed a little weird and someone had forgotten to plug the T-Rex in! Our kids are 10 and 11 and LOVE Jurassic park so l",
          "Very nice place to visit with your kids. Too bad the 5-D and 7-D movie theaters are not included in the admission ticket since you need to pay extra for it (for us not really worth it, although this may be subjective to each traveler).",
          "Even though kids are big dino fans this park does not really meet high expectations because of not very realistic looking dinos. They are somehow plastic and not worth price you pay. Movies were not good and in fact can be too scary for small kids.",
          "We went over there in April 2016. The prices were very cheap about \u20ac 26 for 5 of us- 3 kids and 2 adults. The day flew. It is big park and lots of things to do. There is also coffee shop and gift shop. Kids can enjoy Dino Hospital, coloring activities and excavations! I",
          "We've been to quite a few dinosaur parks in our time but this was by far the best one we have ever been to. It was clean, the dinosaurs were very cool and it was laid out well. We went with 4 year old twin boys who were just amazed by it all. The area around it is very",
          "Went with my 9 year old Grandson and 16 year old Daughter, we all enjoyed it, there are lots of life size dinosaurs which have sensors, so when you go past they move and make sounds. The 5D cinema is well worth a visit too.",
          "Hot day, young children... what to do? This park was a nice change. They found it interesting and so did we, as parents. All dinosaurs move or make some noise. Stroll through the park area with some tunnels for cooling down. Fountain and artificial lakes and rivers. All in all,",
          "With a three year old to entertain and looking for something different for time away from the beach and the pool, we set of for Dinosauria. I'm pleased to say we weren't disappointed. There are lots of animated animals arranged individually or groups around a large area. As",

          "Very little to do or see and then at the end a train ride for the little ones that you have to pay for. Best avoided and go to Labyrinth instead.",
          "My 10 year old enjoyed seeing and learning about all the dinosaurs. Also liked that there was a cool indoor room where you could draw pictures of dinosaurs and put them up on the wall. My only comment would be that you had to pay an extra 3 euros per person to go to the 5d",
          "The ticket at the moment is 10 euro, there are very few skeletons of animals not particularly big and few plastic reconstructions with have very few movements. May babies cries but because they are quite jung. I would suggest to avoid such experience.",
          "Visited here with my grandchildren in June. It was entertaining for the younger child but not so for the teenagers. Plenty of space to walk about with things to see. If you pay an extra 3Euro you can visit the 7D animation show, and it was good fun. Prices for food was",
          "This is our second visit to this park and we really enjoyed it again. It was a good way to spend the morning. There is a cinema with a 3D show which you pay extra for but it is worth doing. Nice clean, well run and definitely worth a visit.",
          "Little one went absolutely berserk. The dinosaurs on display look cool and there is a museum attached to it with some history etc. The 4d cinema has an additional \u20ac9 per adult charge which was quite poor. However overall a good half day out if the kids are into dinosaurs and",
          "Had a fantastic time here with our kids. Models are life like, place is clean and well kept. 5D cinema was great. Well worth the money.",
          "The park is really something nice to be visited, not only by kids....as the dinosaurs seem so real!!! The park also offers a 4D film with dinosaurs.....quite interesting!",
          "Really good park especially for the little ones who love dinosaurs! Easy to get to by bus. 4d cinema at the end is a little dated but kids loved it",
          "Very nice place, but only if you have kids or you are a dinosaur geek. The dinosaurs are many , in full physical size, and they move their heads and tales and make sounds. For kids is a great experience!",
          "We decided to visit the park during our weeks holiday to the area so that our 2 yr old had something different to do. It cost \u20ac10 per adult but son was free (all under 4 were!) on first impressions it looked very clean and staff were friendly. We sat and had a drink in the cafe",
          "Spent several hours here today with my teenage daughter and 6 year old son. I loved the way it was set out: entering via the Dino museum then traveling through the time tunnel into the Dino park! Impressive layout with surprises around each corner. Not really suitable for older",
          "Very nice place for small kids (up to 12), I liked the animatronics, the grounds were well kept. Not the kinds of place you'd expect in a holiday island!",
          "Was a bit apprehensive about visiting here but shouldn't have worried as it's a great attraction, especially for the kids. Not far from cretaquarium, it provides a welcome and interesting visit.",
          "Really enjoyed out little visit here,if your stuck for something to do for a few hours then this is the place if you have young children (under 12's) Older children might not enjoy it as much but it is a lovely place with lots of dino info and attractions.",
          "Brilliant for those with young children. Great value for money, real life dinosaurs my little one loved it especially getting a certificate at the end for archeology. Only let down not alot of shaded areas so avoid going when relky hot. Overall would definitely recommend to",
          "This was really good place to spend whole day with kids. You pay for the entry (not much) and have all atractions included! Kids were happy! Recommended!",
          "Great day out as long. As your aren't a dinasaur know it all. Good way of keeping out of the sun for a few hours. 7D cinema is more like a roller coaster but my 4 year old loved it.",

          "We visited dinosauria today with a 2 year old dinosaur fan and a 6 year old. The children really enjoyed this, helped lots by the friendly and happy staff members!! The motion sensor dinosaurs were great for the kids and me and my partner had fun taking fun photos to. The",

          "While on a weeks holiday in Hersonnissos we took our 4 year old son to the dinosauria park for the day and he loved it. It's very educational with life sized dinosaurs on motion sensors that turn as you walk past. Reasonably priced entrance and a large park after the attraction",
          "We visited with our young daughters, we all loved it, lots to see and lots of information! My daughters loved the tunnel u walk through that feels like it's moving, we walked around for ages then my daughters discovered the big sand area where they could dig up bones and then",
          "As a family of 4 (2 year old and 5 year old) we had an excellent couple of hours at Dinosauria. There was plenty for us to do and the kids loved seeing the dinosaurs, drawing and colouring pictures for the wall and searching for dinosaur bones. We really enjoyed the cinema and",
          "Terrible. Cheap looking dinosaurs, rubbish information, 5/7d cinema was comical because it was so bad 13 euro wasted.",
          "Total and utter con. So bad it was hilarious. The water around the dinosaurs had dried up and they were dismantling the park as we were there. Half the bits of not so scary plastic didn't move and if they did, were out of sync. The 5d cinema definitely wasn't 5d - crap 3d",
          "Absolutely brilliant for kids and adults. Educational and fun. Realistic moving and sounding dinosaurs. It has a hospital for sick dinosaurs and a nursery for eggs and newborns. It has 2 sandpits with brushes and spades to find fossils. Don,t miss the 5D film but be warned its",

          "Really only worth a visit if you have children The hospital was what most interesting part for our 2.5 yr old as well as the excavation pits",
          "This was brilliant. As you walk past the dinosaurs they move and roar at you. Lots of different ones to see. There is play area too with a train that you pay for. They also have 7D cinema which is extra too, a great afternoon. Good shop too.",
          "visited here with my 2 daughters aged 11 and 14. Very expensive. nearly 80 euros! basically its plastic dinosaurs around the park who move a bit. There is a 3D experience which you have to pay extra for and it was AWFUL!!! I actually had to get off as it was hurting my back.",

          "We were in gouves mid July, due to the high temperature we headed here at around 6pm which was perfect. The first part is inside and air conditioned, the latter is outside but you are shaded by trees. There are numerous dinosaurs, many I'd never heard of, with lots of",

          "My 4 year old son enjoyed the dinosaur models and a couple of the fossils, and so I have rated this as average rather than poor. For anyone a little bit older though, its not great. For example, a lot of the dinosaurs are reapeated (there are about 3 or 4 T-Rex's all of",

          "Really enjoyed this and great fun for kids (ours are 2 & 4). Highly recommended and looks like the experience is expanding rapidly. It's not as polished as an experience as you might expect from Disney etc of course but that added to the appeal for me. Great, passionate staff",
          "The park is quite large and displays most of the well know dinosaur species, a lot of them life-size. They have motion sensors and move and growl on approach. Visually realistic and well placed among trees and plants. Play areas for children, \"find dinosaur toys\" in the sand",

          "The price is high and for my opinion is not worth it. At first my children were excited to see the dinosaurs but after 10 minutes they were bored. Some of the dinosaurs did not move at all and it was hot because it is an open place. At the \"hospital\" they only hear about the",

          "Kids love it and Kids love it but don't pay extra for the 5d cinema. But of a rip off. The place is very well kept but adults will be bored, it's only small.",
          "We came upon Dinosauria by accident, but once spotted it, couldn't resist going inside to explore. It was fab, considering it has not long been open and will obviously be getting bigger and better in the near future, me and my family loved every minute of it. It was good fun and",
          "Absolutely loved this park. Great prices. Interesting fossil displays but the main fun was the Dinosaur Garden - Incredible!! Our little Granddaughter walked out into the garden and simply said \"WOW!\" As did the rest of us. Fantastic idea, brilliant couple of hours spent here",
          "I suppose we were lucky because both of our children are young and were therefore free. It would be pretty expensive if we were paying for everyone and it was only a short walk round, but my 3 year old son just loved it! The dinosaurs are impressive just because of the size of",
          "We went to Dinosauria at Houston's NRG (formerly Reliant) Park. Folks, you would be better served going to the Houston Museum of Natural History. I guess if the price were more in line then I wouldn't be so critical. My 9 year-old son and I paid $34 to enter, and any",
          "For children only, doesn't worth the money no shead don't forget to take hats and sun protection cream",
          "We took our 4 year old there recently and it was by far her favourite place. The entry fee was really low and it had a lot for her to do. The only dislike was trying to get to it. The bus service was awful and it was surrounded to abandoned buildings.",
          "Excellent dinosaurs, terrible 5d film; suitable only for children. The life size mechanical dinosaurs were excellent as were the facilities but the films on offer were great for air conditioning but not for watching or experience.",
          "Rather expensive entrance fee for such stupid place, but we went there of course because of kids. But kids were not very enthusiastic too - maybe were too tired or too impressed by CreteAquarium. Useful tip: tell your kids Dinosauria is closed and go to CreteAquarium:-)",
          "OK, so if you have kids younger than 13 this maybe be worth a visit. but if you are older, don`t bother. Park was nice. but over in 5-10 minutes. and the 5-D cinema is maybe the worst in the history of mankind.",
          "We made the mistake to go at noon time and as most of the exhibition is outdoors it was very hot. Staff was very friendly, knowlwdgable and helpful. The 5d show was totally not worth it so dont waste your money for it.",
          "We went to this place on July 2014 with our kids. The place is great. Has a 5-D cinema, a restaurant-cafe where you can see a dynosaur walking around and play with kids, a childrens playground, a shop with dyno- souvenirs and ofcourse the dyno-park. The dynosaurs, most of them",
          "the park has lots of animatronic dinosaurs which are great, and a really bad cinema. Visit the CreteAquarium at the same trip to make a day of it.",
          "Had a great day with 3 adults 1 child Interesting facts about exhibits and the animated dinosaurs were good with sound effects Think the 5d film should be included in price",
          "Bit over priced but the kids really enjoyed it. And it filled a cloudy afternoon. If you have small children that like dinosaurs they will love it . The 5d video thing was a bit overrated 3d video with some bubbles blown every now and then.",
          "What a total con. So expensive and so poor. You are paying well in excess of the going rates to walk round a park full of bits of rubber and plastics. The 5d cinema was terrible and costs an extra 3 euros. do yourselves a favour and pop round the corner to crete aquarium.",
          "My son wanted to go so we paid $45 for the 3 of us. The dinosaurs were okay but way too dark to read anything. The noise level was out of control through out the entire place. The moon bounces were plentiful but not worth $45. We could have taken him to a local moon bounce place",
          "This almost escaped 1 star because it was so rubbish that it actually amused us but it's impossible to give it more than 1 star! It was about 20 Euros each to get in which before going in was already expensive but after coming out I was pretty shocked at what I'd spent! But",
          "Expensive at $20/person. Not very educational: the dinosaurs were not to scale, wordy posters hung behind the dinos. Garbage gift shop. The worst part was the \"dragon, knight and fairy\" exhibit. Envision creepy mannequins wearing ill fitting Party City fairy princess",
          "WOW! Did you guys hit up the elementary school to set up and run this thing? 20.00 a pop? For what? To keep the animatronics running? This experience was awful. It took about 10 minutes to walk through. I could run a better event in my back yard with my dogs dressed in",
          "Dinosauria was a joke. The dinosaur exhibit part was fair, my 3-year-old enjoyed it for about 10 minutes. Many of the lighted description signs were blinking or just broken. Then you have to walk thru an overpriced gift shop - great. Then it's just a bunch of bouncy houses.",
          "Sorry to say this was disappointing at best. Euro 32 to see a few oversized plastic toys with a bit of machinery in them. Neither children liked or were impressed by this. There is a better dinosaur in one of the bead shops in Athens. There is a 3d film, but at another 3 euro",
          "My kids enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs models at Dinosauria, youngest one actually has been horified ;-) we did not go promoted 3D (or 5D ....) cinema from the reason mentioned before - my kids are too small yet. Watching with adults eyes, I expected little bit more...",

          "I'm surprised there are so many positive comments, the place is actually very small once you get in and has a very restricted range of model dinosaurs, often repeating dinosaurs a couple of times in different sizes - ridiculous given the size of the place and so few species they",
          "Went to see as it was new since last visit to Gouves, quite costly at 8 Euros each for adults be warned if you want to go into 5D cinema it is extra and not included in price (what a con) at 3 Euros, kids will love it there is a lot of models which have laser movement when you",
          "This is certainly a right place to go with kids. When you stay some time, you get tired of pool, sea, restaurants. Then the right time for visiting attractions becomes necessary. And this is good attraction, dinosaurs with moving parts, and the 5D movie is exactly what your kids",
          "Our children were thrilled! The personnel was very helpful and children oriented. You can easily spend two hours there and the souvenir shop has very reasonable prices",

          "We really enjoyed this. My girls13, 10 and my son who is 2 all loved it and we learnt something along the way. The staff are friendly and knowledgable. If you zoom around and dont take the time to chat to them or read the information you obviously won't get so much out of your",

          "We spent a half a day at Dinosauria as a party of five, including a three year old. It\u2019s near to Gouves and has only been open a few weeks. There are a series of life size models set in an enormous chamber which has been designed to give a life like feel for the prehistoric",

There's a kids play area at the end with some 'dinosaur bone' digs, and some other bits. The toilets by the play area were filthy though, best to use the ones in reception.",

The price for entry is a bit too high and we were a bit disappointed about the snack bar and food area, but all in all a recommendation to visit, can be combined with a visit of nearby Creteaquarium.",

          "We had a great time.  We would definitely recommend it",
          "Not real value for money, not sure how they justify \u20ac10pp. Dinosaurs doesn't look realistic and only slightly moves. Not many to see or much else to do, we took around 30 minutes to clear the park and at a slow pace.  Planetarium should be included in the price not extra.",

We liked \"dinosaur hospital\" there every hour is run small guided excursion where guy is telling interesting things about dinosaurs this is for free (included in entrance ticket). For science room(2eur), cinema(3eur) and observatory(8eur is included science room) need to pay extra. Science room is interesting.",
          "Too expensive. 36 euro for two adults and two children. My 7 years old kids were much more attracted by the playgrounds than by the dinosaurs. Though playgrounds are not so well protected from the sun.",
          "Had a great time. Well worth a visit",
          "It's not huge but the children love it, which let's face it is why you are at a dinosaur attraction. You start off looking at some \"skeletons\" of triceratops stegosaurus etc before going through the time machine where there are many \u2026",

          "Too expensive for the quality of the exibits. During the summer I visited at noon and the whole cement was burning and without any air conditioning inthe spaces between. Poorly maintained. For that price it should be completely interactive",
          "Absolutely brilliant day out, so much fun although don't expect anything spectacular haha. Food was great at the caf\u00e9 and well priced :)",
          "Good but doesn't advertise that the cinema costs extra as well as the science museum & planetarium. My 3yr old loved it and we had around 2 hrs there. Easy to get to from malia, stalis and hersonissos by bus every 15mins.",
          "Half of the animatronics didn't work, the ones that did didn't move alot. We had to pay extra to see a poorly animated movie. Wouldn't recommend this park, even though the entrance fee is only 10 euros",
          "Very interesting park where you can see replicas of dinosaurs",
          "It is a nice park for children with a lot of dinosaur models which growl and move a bit. Quite some information about different dinosaurs. There is one animation: dino-hospital - every half-an-hour. There is also a game for kids to collect \u2026",

          "Amazing place for the kids",
          "Nice park, fair price. It's a little bit far from Heraklion and not very well connected by bus. A taxi trip will cost 27 euros one way (from Heraklion). The 7D cinema is actually a VR goggles and chair and doesn't have any dinosaur themed programs. 5 euros extra also, so not worth it from my point of view.",

          "Water park has great slides and is a must do! You scan everything on your wristband (food, giftshop, drinks etc) and pay the total when you leave. Lockers are a reasonable price and the park is well kept. From Stalis it's about 40 minutes. Thought the transfer cost was",
          "We visited here as a family of 4, booked online to take advantage of 15% off. Hotel arranged a cab for us to get there. Kids enjoyed it, yes its a bit dated but there is something for all ages, lots of sunbeds and shade. Food basic so if you don't have massive expectations you",
          "We enjoyed it very much, it was thrilling and fun. Also we would like to give a shoutout to the beautiful lifesaver on kamikazi and the competetition slide.",
          "Excellent day out! Rides fun, clean and kept us busy all day! Lots of sunbeds and didn't have to queue for more than 10 mins. Worth every penny! Took own lunch but had drinks there. Didn't go on any extreme level 3 slides as others fast enough for us all!",
          "We went to the park on 21 Aug with family of 3 (2 Adults + 5 years kid. ) , we arrived around 1 pm and we only paid 40 Euro in total ( i am not sure if it is late admission discount:) ) my kid had so much fun, there are two children pool with slides and she went to 4 bigger",
          "Myself & my husband took our 10 year old grandson on holiday to Crete, as he is a lover of water parks we didn't hesitate in taking him to water city, however, it is a large park but the rides are very far apart so we had to keep moving sun loungers, also. it was really dirty on",
          "Great day out for the teenagers and adults alike. Clean, well run and the lines go down quick. Took a pack up as thinking the food would be expensive or limited availability. But prices where fair. Hotdogs and sandwiches were 3 -4 euros. Well worth the day out. Time flew by.",
          "We parked our teen kids to WaterCity for a day...slapped then with money and sunscreen. On the ads, we were quite fearful of the types of slides (being as hellicopter parents)... but we relented and let them go. Thankfully the slides are engineered to slow down the rider",
          "I've been to Watercity in July and I think It has been the best waterpark I've seen. It's very big with a huge amount of attractions which are simply amazing and extreme ! All the staff is very friendly and always ready to assist you. What I really liked is that the waiting time",
          "water part is always a fun, but we all (adults, kids, and teenagers) had much more fun in the Aqua water park.",
          "I wasn't there but my husband went with my family , including my teenage niece , they had a fantastic time . They did the craziest of rides and had no complaints at all. Staff were great and kept everyone safe. One slight moan was the queue for the greek food (gyros pitta etc)",
          "We went to watercity as s family with three teenagers and found it had everything. It had a really good cashless system so everything goes in your locker at the beginning and you pay at the end. This meant our teenagers could grab a hotdog or drink when they needed and could",
          "Watercity is a big, varied water park to the south east of Heraklion in the hills. Most, but not all, activities; slides, pools, etc. are top notch and well maintained. It doesn't come cheap however. A modest visit of 2 adults and 2 pre-teens cost us about \u20ac150. So 4 stars for",
          "Really well organised, wide variety of rides and a spectacular view over Heraklion. Good system of paying via your wrist band so no need to carry money. Food and drink reasonably priced for this type of location. We loved it!",
          "We got the excursion ticket from watercity website, picked up from our hotel at 9.50am and taken back at 5pm. Perfect amount of time, we went on a Thursday and it was pretty quiet, minimal queues and plenty of time to do all the slides more than once. Just to note that the",
          "Excellent time at Water city, well worth a visit. Went with a 17, 13 and 6 year old and 2 adults. 6 year old could go on most things but obviously not the really big water shoots. Cashless system in the park makes it easy to purchase food and drink and you just pay at the end.",
          "We were a big group, aged 8 to 78, and everyone had fun. We bought the tickets online, and really appreciated the informative email with travel instructions. A bit on the expensive side, even with a discount. A lot of great rides, and staff took the safety measures very",
          "Visited this waterpark whilst on holiday in Crete. We booked via our accommodation and got return transport included in the price. Waterpark is on a large are, and there were plenty of sunbeds. Average rides, can not really compare o somewhere like Sian Park in Tenerife, but",
          "Ageing park with some decent rides. Friendly staff but overpriced. Kids can ride grade 2 and 3 rides but,if they want to ride grade 1, you will have to pay an extra \u20ac8.50 taking the cost of a child\u2019s ticket up to that of an adult. At no stage we\u2019re we made aware of this until",
          "Hi, After a doubt between Water City and Aqua Plus for my family with 3 children (12, 8, 2), i decided to go on Water city. Generally I think it was a right decision, however some issues i want you to consider. Pros: 1. Huge park (city....), which acc. many feedbacks is bigger",
          "Attended the park with kids aged 10 and 6. Rides rated at levels 1, 2 and 3. 10 yr old was able to do all rides as he was taller than the 140cm required, and 6 year old levels 1 and 2. Had so much fun. Cashless system really good. Signs say the lockers are free, however they are",
          "Great day out, good value for money, staff friendly, clean environment. Wrist band payment excellent. A safe day if you follow instructions!",
          "We had fun here, spend approximately four hours. Not all slides fits 10 years old children. So from 10 slides that they have we could do only 7. The staff is nice. Not sure that the experience was worth the price that we payed.",
          "We had great fun - lots of good slides and very friendly staff. My only criticism is that the slides with no inflatable rings were quite rough in places, so lots of people had sore backs. A t shirt helps. There were lots of sun loungers available and lots of shade. Queues were",
          "Fantastic As said great organisation Get wrist band from shop for locker Just bring credit card and pay for food etc at end of stay. Kids and grandma even loved the rides! Kids got henna tattoos, reasonably priced Loved every minute!",
          "A fantastic day out! Lots to do, very well organised, clean and relatively short queues. We booked online and got a taxi which worked well. We have a 13 yr old and 10 yr old; both had a ball, as did we. Would recommend it to all!",
          "We had a great day at the parc, many fun attractions, although the wild river was kind of a problem (not enough water). Food is ok for a day stay..",
          "We visited Water City on 25th July 2019. We all had a fabulous day. We have been to water parks elsewhere where we have paid significantly more money and queued an awful lot longer. We booked online with a 15% discount, kids were full price as >1.4m which meant they could go on",
          "Nice location, beautiful views. Very crowdy, probably, because of the high season. Could be cleaner. Very long waiting time at food kiosks. Slides are cool. Together with tickets it coated 120 euro for 3 of us",
          "We had a great day at water city. With younger kids my main concern on water slides is always safety. The lifeguards at water city are extremely safety conscious and made sure that there was only ever one person on the slides at any time. Yes,it is expensive, but you can",
          "A big lie ! This is the truth ! The publicity is overrated and exagerated ! I have been to some waterparks in my life but this is the worst ! The prices are huge for everiyhing ! We had a horrible hot dog and the service was ...i dont know there are not rnough wotds in the",
          "We went for a day out as a family of 5. 2 x 13 year olds are charged as adults. Cost of visit was over 100 euros to get in. So, I suppose we expect that. However, its the extra charge of 4 euros to use a locker that makes me mad. Surely, at over 100 euros to get in you should",
          "Watercity was fantastic. Lots of slides, queues were well organised and moved quickly. There were plenty of free (unlike Majorca) rings for half the slides, free sunbeds, and reasonably priced food (\u20ac23 for 3 of us at lunch incl a beer). All in all a great day and would highly",
          "This park is a perfect place to spend your day in family. The ticket is a little bit expensive but the prices of the food and drinks are reasonable. The toboggans are great and the atmosphere good. Really good staff.",
          "I visited with my husband and late-teens children. Everyone enjoyed the day, seemed very quiet and no queuing for slides. I managed to get a 15% discount on admission by pre-booking tickets on their website. You get a wristband on arrival with a bar-code on it, so can use",
          "Brilliant day out. Rides were excellent. Arrive at 10:00 as it doesn't get busy till after 12:00. Some of the staff are a touch miserable.",
          "A great day out but it is worth arriving early and ensuring you utilize all the rides to benefit from the facilities. Very clean and not overly busy so it was even more enjoyable.",
          "Plenty of slides, good day, but food expensive and not much to choose if you don\u2019t like chips or burgers. Kids had a great time on all the different slides.",
          "Went here this year for the second time, came last year too. We went slightly off peak (early July this year, early September last year) and for us the queues were small or non-existent, so lots of sliding gets done! Many sunbed areas. Me & The Boy enjoyed sliding a lot, you",
          "We had a lovely visit to water city (once we\u2019d found it - not easy to get to from the new road heading west towards Heraklion - use sat nav). The staff were friendly and printed our tickets bought online. We enjoyed all the slides (favourite was the Minotaur). The wave pool",
          "slides were amazing me and my dad had a lot of fun. Only the staff at the fastfood bar where you can get burgers and fries were so unfriendly. the girl at the cashier gave me such a nasty look plus the system is so slow. Please management give you're staff there a hospitality",
          "Nice waterpark with lots of slides for all ages. With wristband can buy from shop and snackbars (credit 100\u20ac) I would recommend to inform visitors about time. Because a lot of people come with travel agency and should exit until ex: 16:00.",
          "Pretty good time we spent at watercity, but water is not so clean i expected for 27\u20ac entry. Lot of rides, everyone can choose your own, no queues all day long, i was surprised. I have been there with 2,5 years old baby and no problem.",
          "bitoutinthe sticks but a good park with enoughrides to keep most kids happy.Lockers for valuables and plenty ofsunbathe space -clean and goos food",
          "Good waterpark with lots of fun. Kids liked it a lot, the activities are good, large number of slides, staff is friendly and has an high focus on safety. The wristband is also used to log purhases from shops and several snackbars. The payment is done when leaving - smart feature!",
          "Second time we did this waterpark , it didn't change much and that was a good thing. We enjoyed it a lot, the layout is really well done. Grab a donut and go down the slide, simple as that. No fastpass or anything, everybody equal customer. Bought pictures here again as well.",
          "It a hard find destination not well signed on the way but if you use navigation it drive there. You have some fine rides there it could be crowded in high season. It was also today but you havent wait more than 4 minutes for a ride. Parking is for free. We have some problems",
          "Our 2nd visit there. A lot of fun for kids. Clean and safe. By car or transfer: it depends on. If to speak about money only then for 1-3 persons worth to order tickets+transfers from your hotel; for more people just make calculations /my calculations show that if you get a car",
          "We we\u2019re very disappointed. We payed 91 for 2 adults and kids of 3 and 7 years. Everything in the park is old. Everything needs renovation. Too much money for three toboggans for kids under 140 cm. Not worth of that money. Definitely never come back. Very disappointed.",
          "Very interesting insight into traditional and current life in rural Crete with many superb exhibits, easy to find in Piskopiano and surrounded by many great shops and restaurants.",
          "Really nice waterpark with friendly customer service and lifeguards. Bought the tickets online as there was a discount available and then called the watercity number to reserve the bus transfer seats. Just be aware that the bus transfers are 8 Euros on top of the water park",
          "We were friends at 20s that visited the park and we did order shuttle service to the park and it was 45 minutes late to pick us up. It was also 30 min late to shuttle us back. The waterslides were poor, maybe one waterslide was good. But they did have amazing wavepool",
          "Excellent park for our family visit. We were a mixed age group of 11 ranging from 8 to mid 40's. The rides were great, something for everyone, and we didn't have to queue long for any of them. There are some steep hills to climb to get to the top of a lot of the rides so expect",
          "I\u2019m not a massive lover of water parks but I have to say I had a fantastic day here. We booked our tickets online the day before to take advantage of the discount. If you purchase a child ticket (our son is 11) it means they can only go on the rides numbered 1 and 2 but you can",
          "We are a couple in our mid-twenties and had a great time at Water City. We visited on a Monday in May and the park was fairly quiet, we didn\u2019t have to wait long (if at all) for the slides. There\u2019s a great selection suitable for all ages. As some of the other reviews mention",
          "The park is nice. Well maintained. However the water could be a lot cleaner. We visited on a windy day (it's very cold on a windy day) and the water was full of bugs and leaves. The slides are nice, but not spectaculair. Because of the off season we did not have to wait any",
          "Had a really good day here , would definately return.. lots of slides/ activitys .. cashless system is also very good as you can pay for things using your wrist band and then pay at the end.. my only criticism is that you have to keep running up the hills back to the top of the",
          "we visited in late May and it was almost empty, never had to queue and got on every ride many times. food was disappointing, although served quickly. we did the organised tour which dropped us off at 10.30am and didn\u2019t collect us till 4.30pm. we found this too long a day for",
          "My partner and I visited Water City today through our Hotel and paid \u20ac40 each for transfer and entrance. After seeing the leaflets and website claiming it was \u2018the biggest waterpark in Crete\u2019, had over 30 \u2018games\u2019 and had the biggest waves, we were very excited to spend our day",
          "We visited Watercity last May whilst on holiday and we were extremely lucky because there was only a few people in the park as it had just opened recently after undergoing refurbishments. There is a good choice of slides and tube rides where you sit in rubber rings/donuts. As",
          "We booked this via our hotel for simplicity and felt it was still a decent deal with coach transfer. We set up on the 'island' in the middle of the lazy river as the wasn't too crowded and looked like it would offer a good bit of shade during the day. The entrance and lockers",
          "Me and my partner visited this water park in early October, the weather was warm but still windy in shade, there were no queues at all which was great, we managed to complete most of the slides, then decided to stick to using slides that only had rings, because some of the",
          "My new husband and I visited on our honeymoon, the rides and whole waterpark were very clean. All the staff were friendly, views were incredible and most importantly we had lots of fun on the slides. Would reccommend to anybody, definitely our preferred waterpark as we visited",
          "Visited water city with the wife (pregnant) and children (12,9,7). After visiting water parks on every holiday we've been on this would rank as the worst. We had to pay full price for the wife even though she was pregnant and couldn't go on any of the slides, surely a spectator",
          "This place was so much fun. Lot of slides to choose from, well organized. Easy to buy drinks and food because you didn't have to carry money with you. Pay when you live. Crazy slides to us adults and smaller slides for children. Area was very clean. We had so much fun. And",
          "The place is very well situated, far away from the center in a quiet area. It is easy to drive there, but don\u2019t forget it is easy for Crete. Two of the slides were closed so we didn\u2019t tried all of them, which makes me think that you pay the full price and you don\u2019t use",
          "Visited with family and two yoiung children. Great facilities for all ages. Good selection of refreshments and snacks. Very Clean.",
          "we were a family of 16 8 adults and 8 grandchildren of varying ages. From the time we arrived until we finally left fun was had by all.Some of the younger children were disappointed that they weren't allowed on the some of the bigger slides. The Jacuzzi was very disappointing",
          "There was a large group of us that attended and it was great that nobody felt left out. The staff are helpful and friendly, food and drink is really tasty and good value also using a barcode system so you do not need cash everywhere you just pay when you leave. Everytime we",
          "Did this a package with transport there & back from Malia. Great day fun slides, went home exhausted after a fun packed day",
          "As it is out of season there was literally not many people there at all. We didn\u2019t have to wait in a que for any of the slides therefore we had been on them all in less than an hour. 2 of the slides were closed all day and we have no idea why as the water was even running down",
          "I had high hopes for this water park, however they were soon dashed. Half of the rides were not open, and even the wave pool was not on, so there wasn\u2019t much to do apart from go on the same 3-4 rides that were available. Warning: be careful of rides without a ring because you",
          "Out of season so not a queue in sight. Able to go on all of the rides as much as we wanted with no wait. All the rides were good but not the best water park I have been to.",
          "Visited whilst on holiday with grown up children and grandchild staff all very helpful and happy to help park itself was. Very clean and plenty of lifeguards slides and rides had no queues and no waiting although I imagine this would change in high season Food and drink is",
          "Really amazing park for all ages.You can have a full day of games and you will not regret it. Food was not so good but the last thing you would do with all these slides is to eat. Even if you are afraid of hights you can try the lazy river or the pool of waves. Just great!!!",
          "First time at the watercity waterpark and it was a really great experience! I love the thing that it\u2019s huge and you can do so different things and have fun. It\u2019s really clean. Most of the stuff is friendly and happy especially the lifeguards. But I think they can lower the price",
          "A group of 9 of us booked from a wee shop for $30 and that included a bus there and back. Definitely would recommend to anyone, and would return if i was ever back in Malia.",
          "We came here for the day while on our family holiday. This was a great day! Exceptionally clean, slides are fantastic, lots for all of us to do. Will definitely return next time we ho to Crete.",
          "Went here this month it was recommended to us by the locals. I\u2019ve been to water parks in America so them compared to this one didn\u2019t really compare. But it was still a nice day out. Younger kids would probably have a better day out. If you pre-book your tickets you get a cheaper",
          "We went here during September and there were hardly any queues (if any) all day. The park is situated about 10 mins drive from Heraklion Airport up a hill. They have an intuitive cashless barcode payment system. Don\u2019t be fooled though as there are very few prices advertised and",
          "Great Waterpark, we were advised to go early afternoon as buses leave at 4pm so less busy. Glad we did, plenty rides all had fun",
          "Recently visited. Had a lovely relaxing day. Took our 10 year old who to be honest did not want to go on all the fast / bigger rides so we spent most of our time on the smaller slides, lazy river, and the 2 large pools with slides and waves. The larger slides looked fantastic",
          "Overall the park is a great day out.. loads of great rides.. The only issue I had with it was bought tickets on line to get the discount.. children are classed as under 140 cm.. both mine are under 140cm so I bought 2 adult and 2 child tickets. The first slide we queued for we",
          "We loved it, our son is 4 years old and there was plenty of slides for him. We spend there the hole day.",
          "We had such a good time on our visit to the Water Park! The drive up to the park is stunning with awesome views of the island! They have a great system of payment, where you scan whatever you buy to a wrist band! They do offer lockers for your gear.... but it\u2019s not really",
          "This place was great, queues not too long. Slides were different levels of difficulty. Plenty of places to eat and relax. Please note all food and drink purchased is done on bar code so no money is in the park BUT if you don\u2019t keep a check on the kids you could end up with a",
          "A last minute decision based on the weather (rainy and wind West of Heraklion where we are staying), we (family of 4, with two boys of 7 and 9) made the pilgrimage to Salt Water City Park; the first water park we have ever been to that uses salt water. It made no difference to",
          "Went in August. After speaking to tour operators we hired a car as the water park was about 75km from our hotel and we were informed that the water park is built several hundred metres (high) up a mountain Road with no bus service and very high taxi costs. We checked on line and",
          "Great day out, spent all day there, we had a 20 mth year old baby, a 6 year old and a 13 year old, they all enjoyed the day. Some of the staff could do with learning some customer service but that can be overlooked. Money is not used in the park, they scan your wrist band when",
          "This was an amazing day out. The temp on the day was about 33 degrees. The water was refreshing and plenty of shade to be had. There is a lot of seating areas and sun beds. The way you pay is good, you will be given a wrist band to wear while your in the water park and this is",
          "Who would have thought a silly old pensioner would like this sort of place. Loads of things to do, all wet! Death ride, I'm still here! Nice food and drinks. Toilets clean even tough busy. Shaded places if you cant take part. Great time for the family group",
          "Lots of different slides to try for all ages. Queues not too bad, max waiting time of about 10 mins. Clean and plenty of shady spots. Signage from main road could have been better.",
          "Went with the Children and Grandchildren (22). The slides are awesome and the water lovely and warm. Difficult to find but well worth the effort as everyone had a fantastic time. Not expensive and the way that the manage payments in the park is something many other attractions",
          "The kids never get bored! So many rides, queues were never massive. Clean, safe, loads of sun beds. Food is ok but drinks are expensive. Highly recommended visiting here.",
          "We were there on a friday. There was many people at the park, and a lot of waiting time on the popular rides. I love the no cash system where you pat with your wristband. A lot of differnt kind of rides from all to the little kids to the adults. I would like to visit again so",
          "Last minute decision - great day out. Lockers keep your belongings safe and dry and wrist bands mean you dont have to carry cash or valuables.",
          "Family of 4 with 2 teenage boys. We liked this water park. As with most places where you haven't been before it takes a little while to work out what to do/where to go. First thing after entering you might want to go down to the shop below the entrance where you can get a",
          "Watercity is not a cheap day out but it is certainly fun! The four of us took a tour bus from our hotel. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it as I\u2019m not a huge fan of rides and that combined with cold water (no heated pools) doesn\u2019t give me pleasure. However I still enjoyed the day! I",

          "We visited the water-city in the summer its too good to be there the service is very good the slides are fun but . Lines not short but also not so long, food are not the best. (Fast food). Absolutely this attraction must see for who visit crete.",
          "We went there by car from Heraklion....very easy. parking is big enough slides were good with 3 levels of difficulty (blue, red, black) You can book tickets in advance and get 10% or 15% discount on the regular price but careful, when you book tickets online, they are not valid",
          "Good day out for teenagers, only a couple of 'adrenaline' slides but everyone quite happy. Very clean and well organised-very safe with lots of life guards who were actually watching the pools and slides. Food was good and not too over priced considering the park had a captive",
          "I do not have a big exeperience in visiting water-parks but this one I liked and my 7-year kid also. Many different attractions, a lot of people but no need to wait in queues for too long time (excl. Tarzan's game because of safety reasons). It was clean, safe, nice. Safety",
          "Disappointment. 36 slides is a lie as they counted every little slide. Long queues. Not many new or interesting slides. The slow river is under the boiling sun and not pleasant at all. The ground is hot to walk. Cyclone slide is strange as you get stuck inside the last bit and",

          "Overall this is a good waterpark. Not the best out there but has a good offering of rides and prices for the most part are acceptable for this kind of venue. (0.50 for a water, 9 euros for a gyros with salad and fries). Just found the fanta expensive at 3.30 it was the same",
          "Arrived at 11.30am mid summer as a family of four. There was sufficient parking and the park was starting to fill up at this time. There was a five minute queue to pay for entry, which cost 99 Euros in total for two adults and two children. My 13 year old son had to pay an adult",
          "The elder teens didn't really go on much because of very long queues on the day leaving them dejected. Options for the younger one (7) for me is very limited. Because of the under 120cm rule he was limited to what I would call toddler slides. Wave pool was quite cool. Elder",
          "We are water park junkies, with Florida being our regular holiday destination, but we love Crete for its relaxing atmosphere. Watercity was Great, just got back from second day there this week. Kids were fine running around on their own, felt very safe and family orientated.",

          "Kids loved it here, slides ect are great fun with not much walking in between. Visited in August, queued for short times. Wave pool fantastic. Food a little disappointing which is why I\u2019ve not given 5 stars",
          "So i love waterparks and everytime I visit a new country I check out their water parks and folks, I gotta say that Water City really was something I put my hopes in, only to be dissapointed. Google says people spend up to 6 hours there, well me and my bf went through every",
          "Fabulous Waterpark, fun, brilliant rides, lots to do. Had a lovely time. Can\u2019t praise the staff enough! Can be a bit pricey, for food, drinks etc..but suppose that\u2019s what you pay in Waterparks now days.",
          "Great fun day. Not have to queue very long at any ride. Only complaint, the floor can be very hot to walk on bare feet.",
          "This was a lot of fun for a day out with young adults and an 11 year old, we did most the rides, but enjoyed the ones in the rings most as we got a few scrapes from the more vigorous slides that you do without rings. There are lots of places to lie down and relax too. The food",
          "It was my third time in Watercity and everytime is best than previous one. To begin with it has plenty of spaces to park as in some parks gets annoying. Then the personel are very friendly and helpful. Their system works with a bracelet where you enter the park and pay",
          "Took 4 children here (12-14) - they and all 4 adults had a great day. Very well organised although the queues started to build a little in the afternoon. Would recommend getting there early and buying tickets online. Very clean compared to other similar parks we have visited",
          "We decided to book through an excursions place for our visit to Watercity. It worked out a bit cheaper than paying for a taxi and transfers so I\u2019d reccomend checking them out before booking online (we got a better price than their 17% off) On arrival you are given a wristband",
          "Visited the park in July with family with ages ranging from 17 to 51. What impressed me about the park was the short queues at virtually every ride. There are rides to suit every age, including some slower ones for the more sedate or younger rider and also some quite dramatic",
          "We went on a Sunday with 4 children/teens ages 11-16yrs, this was the most enjoyable waterpark I\u2019ve ever been too, there was very little queuing at rides 5-10 max, the park was spotless, staff very nice and helpful, although it does not have some of the white knuckle rides other",
          "We were disappointed on our recent trip to Watercity as despite it being advertised as the biggest waterpark in Crete, it was not very big at all. Wouldn't have taken much more than an hour to do all the slides if we hadn't stopped for a hotdog. Too many slides that seemed dated",
          "Not cheap but worth the trip. 11 big water slides. Places to eat. Sovenier shop. And photographers go around take photos of you and your kids than you need to choose a few out of 100. Hard to do put our best picture on our holiday",
          "This place is by far the worst water park I\u2019ve ever visited in my life. The sun loungers are broken, chipped and have holes in them, the parasols look dreadful and most of them are broken. Most of the slides feel very unsafe and are very uncomfortable to ride since there are",
          "Lots of slides, ranging from easy ones to crazy ones, lots of facilities and minimal queues. We had a fantastic day, spent hours there, and the kids (ages 9 and 12) went on the rides over and over again. We had cause to use the medical facilities (not the park\u2019s fault), and",
          "Massive site with a vast array of different slides from the gentle and lazy to the frankly terrifying. Take the rides that have the inflatable rings as the ones without will leave you with a bruised back. Huges shops, clean showers, lots of food, drinks and refreshments. funky",
          "A very enjoyable experience for all the family... Not the best waterpark I\u2019ve been to but definitely something for everyone! Caters very well for young children & the wave pool is fantastic! Take your own towels & locks for lockers to save yourself some cash.. There\u2019s lots of",
          "We visited this park in the middle of July which is a high season but were nicely surprised it was not packed like others parks for example Siam park in Tennerife or Tatralandia in Slovakia. iIt is not as big as the other two I mentioned but it's big enough to spend a great day",

          "Generally clean and well-run park, with good slides at different levels. Reasonable food at acceptable prices. Ample parking and many sunbeds. More attention should be paid to the music. While it is a plague in most places there days, playing songs with overtly sexual texts when",
          "My family was skeptical of going to Watercity after reading a lot of the reviews however we decided to go and make our own judgement. We all had a fabulous time. There are many slides to choose from which were so much fun.The park is very clean and well run. The slides are built",
          "It was average at best. There were a good number of water slides but they were very dated and some of them I had to push myself along. It's good for half a day out and kids would really enjoy it, but for people that are looking for a thrill dont bother.",
          "The children liked the food. The slides were funny especially crazy river. It was possible to bring own food if we left it in the entrance and eat it there.",
          "We hired a car to visit this water park as we wanted to spend as long as possible there and the scheduled coach trip would have left an hour or two before closing. It was the same cost to hire a car as it was to book the four of us onto a coach from Agia Pelagia (two adults +",
          "Pleasantly surprised by this water park. Plenty of slides kept us occupied. Some are white knuckle too. We just turned up and paid on the gate... had a nasty feeling that there were plenty of deals going if you booked in advance. Food and drink reasonable however please avoid",
          "I took my 16 daughter here when we were in Crete. We had a hire car so it was easy to get to- but it seems to be in the middle of nowhere, so i assume busses must stop here. We had a great day- relaxed by pool over lunch, Queues were not too long, and the wrist bands which",
          "My boyfriend and I (late 20's) went to the water park in July 2018. We had booked online in advance and received 15% off so paid just over 22 euros each. We showed the e-ticket at reception and that all ran smoothly. We hired a car rather than taking a transfer as we were",
          "Overall the slides where fun and the staff was very clear and helpful. Although, I got stuck during the middle of some slides and found that very dangerous. And I recommend not going on Adrenaline (the red slide that goes side to side) As my sister flipped off the inflatable",
          "we enjoyed 7 hours and they are ok. the pools are ok....the staff is ok....the slides are not very dangerous but are ok\ud83d\ude01",
          "Visited here last year with my partner. We had an excellent time. The slides are fun and there's something for everyone. We'll worth visiting if you have hired a car. I could imagine I'd be costly to get too by taxi though.",
          "The Waterpark is in the middle of nowhere. It is not a great place to visit on a whim. Took a taxi there which was 30\u20ac according to the taximeter. The taxi that was called for us from the watercity reception was 40\u20ac with no taximeter. If you plan to take a trip there arrange",
          "Really enjoyed our trip. Would definitely recommend. Staff were friendly, the place looks clean and the slides were great.",
          "Visited here while on a one week vacation in Hersonissos and was very pleased with the overall cleanliness and number of slides available. Food and drinks were good and reasonably priced. We were picked up and returned to the hotel in good time.",
          "We visited this park on our last day and were pretty disappointed. We had visited Acquaplus earlier in the week and although we were told WaterCity was \"the biggest and best\", I'd have to disagree! The slides without the inflatable hoops absolutely destroy your back and even",
          "We had a great day today at watercity. Both myself (26) and partner (23) loved it! Food is decent price and really tasty. Cardless and cashless system in the park... you have a wrist band that is scanned and then pay on exit. Great variety of slides. I would advise wearing",
          "There was a good mix of slides which were great fun. Spent 6 hours here and didn't get bored. Would recommend taking your own padlock for the lockers otherwise you need to pay 3 euros plus a 2 euro deposit. The water was quite dirty in places and some of the slides were very",
          "the slides without rings will kill your back - highly recommend avoiding. The rings however are fine.",
          "Visited this month and we had such fun, came as a couple on a Monday so it wasn\u2019t too busy or too quite. We paid \u20ac70 for tickets and transport from our hotel that we purchased which worked out cheaper than taxi transport. The slides and pools were fun and we had he perfect",
          "We booked a day trip to this water park for our accommodation for 30\u20ac each which we thought was great value. Picked up from our accommodation in Piskopiano around 9:30 and got to the park soon after 10. It was very quiet at first so we were able to get loungers, put our things",
          "The waterpark was quite big with lots of things to do but we were there first thing in the morning and even then the water was quite dirty. The food was priced how you would expect in a water park. The photo girls were a bit rude and pushy I have to say as well but I don\u2019t think",
          "Spent the day here. Park was great fun and lucky for us it was not busy so there were no queues. Definitely not a place to visit if unfit as there is a lot of climbing up to the slides. Fun day out.",
          "We didnt think the park would be open as website said opening 14th May, but hotel checked and booked us in. Park was really quiet and that was real bonus as no queues and no crowds. Loved it. Park needs some tlc but apart from that it was really good day.",
          "Me and my boyfriend had a great day at the water city. Slides are amazing and much better than I expected (hyper race, crazy river and turbo cyclone), wave pool is on at 1pm and 3pm. Wristbands and lockers make the experience much easier. It wasn\u2019t busy and we could easily go on",
          "We took our 2 year old & he loved it, there\u2019s a good kids bit with 4/5 slides then round at the wave pool which wasn\u2019t on, there was a splash park with slides etc but it was very dirty & had all sorts floating in the water. The photographers were great, we got some lovely",
          "This is a fun day out! We visited in September and there were very few queues and generally it was quiet! There was plenty of sunbeds and a number of rides! Some of the reviews are disappointing but I think this is because people are expecting it to be like Aquaventure! Its much",
          "We went at the end of the season, so didn't have to queue for anything...not that much there for young (5 and under) children to be fair, but the boy was happy anyway. Staff were lovely and well worth a visit if your stuck for something to do with the kids.",
          "Not recommend to go after September. Because water is really, I MEAN REALLY cold. At least you could offer lower prices as it\u2019s not the season. This reason, ruined our day at water park. Everything else is pretty awesome.",
          "We visited on a saturday, no waiting lines. Nice slides, we had a lot of fun, water in the pools was a bit cold, no waves in wavepool, staff was friendly, food and drinks were not cheap.",
          "My partner and I visited Watercity in October so not ovally warm to be walking about soaking wet. A few rides were closed too. Some really fun slides, especially those you have to use an inflatable for. All rides are rated on a scale of 1 to 3 according to how scary they are",
          "We went there in early october and there were almost no queues which made the slides really fun. One problem was that you had to walk back up after a slide with bare feet, which hurt a bit.",
          "We spent one our days here on holidays and it was so much fun....it was end of season so the park wasn't too busy, no major queues or trying to find rings etc...the food was yum and the choice of different slides was just fantastic we had so much fun. We also got to chill out by",
          "We had a great day with our toddler and he absolutely loved it!! However we brought tickets online for myself and husband when we arrived they lady said our son would only be aloud in two pools and was tall enough to do some rides if we paid the 15\u20ac for him so we did! However",
          "Had a great day here. No queues for rides, weather was fab. Lifeguards do a good job. I like the wristband idea, saves carrying money. Thought the price was a bit steep though for the park. Our bus didn't come at the end. About half hour delay, but the park got us back by taxi",
          "This was a great place and must be visited when in Crete. Was a great price and the transfer to and from the hotel was included. The park was very clean and plenty of staff looking after all visitors. The slides were all exciting and had to be ridden over and over again. All in",
          "It's a small water park but had enough slides/flumes to go on for the day. It has flumes/slides that are slowish, fast and really fast but they are all colour coded on the boards outside each slide. Staff were friendly, apart from one who wasn't showing any interest in his job.",
          "We visited on 14 September and it was a very hot day. Not easy to figure out where to buy a padlock for locker. Do not lose the wristband they put on you at entry as it is used to scan on food and drink purchased throughout the day. Plenty of rides to try out. It is a steep",
          "Was a little nervous as this was my first visit to a water park, however beat day ever! Rides were brilliant food was reasonably priced, my only complaint was the floor was as rough as sandpaper on our feet. Other than that no complaints.",
          "Myself and my boyfriend visited this waterpark during our stay in Crete! What a laugh we had, good mixture of adults/ children all different ages. Defiantly visit here/ your there all day and it's brings out your inner child\ud83d\ude06",
          "I love waterparks, but I prefer flumes which have a bit more to them, other than just 'slides'. Unfortunately Water City is mainly just 'slides'. I managed to conquer my fears and go on MOST (not all) but do be aware that if you like tamer water rides, this place may disappoint.",
          "Had a day trip here as part of our Thomson/Tui holiday. Is listed as a \"day\" trip - timewise we arrived 11am ish & pickup was at 4.30pm. Was pretty much spot-on for time, had plenty of time to do all the slides twice/good lounge on the lazy river/play in the wave pool etc. Some",
          "Visited this waterpark as it was an excursion that our holiday providers recommend. I can safely say I will never come back here again. The water was dirty as well as the sunbeds and the floor. The rides were outdated and don't give you the adrenaline rush that you crave and",
          "Had an amazing day at the Watercity Waterpark. The variety of different level attractions fits those just wanting to have fun and a chilled day, to those who enjoy real speed and thrills! These are clearly sign posted by each ride. The park is well laid out with restaurants and",
          "Yes, not the biggest water park ever, we've been to a number of bigger ones with faster chutes, but lots of variation and, for most of the day, there were very few queues. A couple of different things too including a Tarzan swing into one of the pools, a space bowl which you go",
          "The park is really good fun with good slides. About 4 hours here would easily get you atleast a couple of goes on each ride and time for lunch (burgers are REALLY nice) if you don't mind the wasps. Some of the none ring slides can be painful on your back due to the bit where the",
          "Advertised as \"the biggest waterpark in Greece\". Not particularly big lol, if you've ever been to somewhere like Siam Park in Tenerife or one of the waterpark in Florida it's nowhere near the scale of something like that, nor is it as clean or well kept.. not saying that it's",
          "I went as a party of 4 adults and 4 children aged 7-11. We had an excellent day. The tickets are not cheap it cost around 90 euros per family. The water park is really very good, lots of rides for all ages. Adults and children all loved it. We bought food from the cafe at the",
          "Went in first week of September and was quiet so no long queues. First time at a big water park and was great, enough slides to keep going for hours. Lots of little eating places and the wristband system works well, we spent just less than \u20ac40 and had two meals and a few rounds",
          "Had a great day here lots to do, very clean, liked having the wristband and paying at the end of the day saved worrying about leaving valuables about. It's not to expensive for food either which is good as there were 8 of us. Would definitely recommend visiting here.",

          "Came as a couple after hearing such good reviews... weren't we shocked. First came and I did think it was pretty good but food is very expensive for what it is and sun loungers look sad for themselves... Also had a black out for an hour and 45 minutes so nothing worked which",
          "We visited this water park for the third time over a 10 year period. We enjoyed it both as young kids to now young adults. Although it is not the biggest, it's still a fun day out. The pools were quite dirty, but with the volume of sun cream it has to deal with its not",
          "We went there and no one explained how the system works.the waters on the pools were dirty with instincts inside and the life guards don't actually care,they are not polite and I was feeling like ...one more ...at point I had a small accident with my leg and and I was just asked",
          "Good slides for older ones (teenagers) and normal slides too. Lazy pool could be improved as it was quite small.",
          "6 of us decided to visit here on our recent girls holiday and paid 35 euros (transfer included) for the day. Had a great range of water slides, although there weren't any massive slides! Worked on a cashless system which was ideal as it made everything much quicker for",
          "I visited with my kids, 8 and 10, who basically live in water. Having read previous reviews I can agree to most points. We arrived at 3, as I burn easily in hot sun, and had a nice afternoon, could have done with a little more time, especially seeing the price you pay. We didn't",
          "Lovely place it was clean, tidy, not many queues was \u20ac70 for a family of 4 was a good day would visit again, food was reasonably priced, big selection, very friendly staff. Lots of sun beds with parasols.",
          "Having previously visited Siam park and wet n wild, I've got to be honest I was underwhelmed by watercity. The place is looking a bit tatty, many of the waterslides haven't been maintained well and you will exit the ride wondering if you have cuts on your back from the bad",
          "Some really good fun rides at this waterpark. The Kamikaze ride was awesome! You get given a wrist band on the way in and can charge food & drinks on the band and pay on the way out. Food and drink prices reasonable. Would go back, defo!",
          "Enjoyed a fantastic day out as we are all early 20's we thought it would be too young for us but was perfect for us. Rides were excellent and blew us away! Good idea for wristbands and charging food and drink on them. Park was really well laid out but the tarmac was really hot",
          "We spent about 4 hours here. It is a good water park ; within 4 hours we went on everything a couple of times and had something to eat, I guess you could spend the whole day here if you had kids or like to laze about. It is a bit out of the way and may struggle on a quad but it",
          "If there are no queues, you can go on every ride twice in just over an hour. How people can stay here all day is beyond me! This is genuinely the worse water park i have ever been to. Dead bugs in the water when you come out! Absolutely vile",
          "We booked through our Hotel and arrived at the Watercity Waterpark at around 11.00 on a very warm day.... The process of using the bands to record payments of food, drinks and gifts was good and we progressed to a sheltered spot where 11 of us across 4 generations set up camp.",
          "Had a brilliant time at water city. There were a variety of water rides, a lazy river and pools. The slides were great fun, with a lot of variety. When we went the queues were short, which was a plus for us. Would recommend coming here if you're staying nearby.",
          "Having driven past Aquaplus the day before, we wholeheartedly recommend Water City. After seeing what looked like a building site surrounding Aquaplus we didn't have huge hopes for Water City but were very pleasantly surprised by what we saw. The effort put into the park is",
          "This water park is absolutely brilliant. Me, my partner and his family spent the day here and enjoyed every moment. The slides were fantastic and the majority of staff/lifeguards were lovely, only downside was that a few of the lifeguards were distracted and were not observing",
          "Went there with my girlfriend. The entrance fee is really high. As a local i don't suggest this water park. There are better things to do in Heraklion city. Except the entrance fee you have to calculate also: Money for locking rent, Money for eating sth, Money for photos etc...",
          "we went here with a 7 year old who isnt a strong swimmer. She could go on all but 1 slide (as this was 1.7m deep - so even adults couldn't stand). She loved them all and most the pools where depth of 0.8m-1.2m. Friendly staff. Great family day out.",
          "While in Crete we went to both Acqua Plus and Water City. They both have pros and cons for example at Acqua park the staff were a more friendly and personable, the park is laid out well so it's easy to get round and it was completely dead when we went so the queuing time was",
          "It's not all it's cracked up to be in pictures, the park is actually very small and after about 30 minutes there isn't much to do. A great day for children but a rather boring one for adults. The food is also very average.",
          "When we visited water city it was an overcast day but still warm and it worked in our favour as we didn't have to wait for any of the slides! There were no queues which meant we went on every slide several times! Very enjoyable day and well worth a visit!",
          "We really enjoyed a day out to watercity as you go in you get a wristband and anything you purchase in the park u pay on the wristband and u get a receipt with how much ur balance is. The only thing we did pay was the \u20ac2 deposit at the shop for the pad lock that you get back the",
          "After we had been on each slide once, the combination of a lack of people in the park and steep uphill barefoot climbs on sharp paving tiles left us wanting to head back. Although I enjoyed it, is is more for the water park enthusiast.",
          "Whilst holidaying in Gouves we decided on visiting this water park. We booked through the tour operator. A well laid out facility. tired around the edges and needing some TLC but plenty to keep us busy. As with attractions like this, food and drink a bit more expensive than a",
          "Visited with my boyfriend in September for my 21st birthday. The park isn't very big but there are plenty of slides to enjoy. I really enjoyed the day, got to the park for 10 and got on most of the slides within an hour and a half as it wasn't very busy. There is something for",
          "The park has quite many slides, different levels of difficulty. It is located on the top of the mountain, so has nice views. The water was ok, clear. Though we had to queue for the rings and the staff was not that friendly. The food could be better. As overall it was a nice",
          "We visited the park in the middle of August and as expected it was crowded. Even so, our company of 20+ split up and all found all nice place to relax. We had a nice spot next to one of the smaller pools. My wife and I tried out most of the slides and some were really awesome",
          "Visited this water park in October 16. We managed to get a 10% voucher which we found on its web site so maybe check prior to going. You can download onto your phone and show it at the pay point no need to print off. We didnt go on an excursion it cost 15 euro by taxi each way",
          "We visisted Watercity Waterpark this summer and we bought photos on a disc from the photographershop for 20 Euro. We did'nt bring a laptop to Crete so we did not have the opportunitet to check if the photos were on the disc. When we came home they were not on the disc. We have",
          "Went here twice , in October, end of season, with my 4year old and had lots of fun!!!There were enough pools and slides my daughter could do for the visit to be worth while. There were not so many visitors - which I prefer... no cues... enough space in the pools... The staff was",
          "We all enjoyed the park and our kids 14,12 and 10 loved the rides. We drove there with hire car - taxi is expensive for 5 even from Hersinnisis. Think there are shuttles in high season. Be aware that it does not stay open all October - we were there on last day 17/10.",
          "We actually went here in May 2015 but it's only just occurred to me to review the place, having returned to Crete this year and regrettably gone to a waterpark on the other side of the island. Water City is far superior and if you're in the area (or even a drive away), it's",
          "Great day out. We visited in mid october and was still lovely and warm. All the rides were open. Booked the tickets and bus via our rep. In our group there were 5 adults 2 teenagers 4 kids and 2 toddlers. There was something for everyone. Only critisim was that the floors are",
          "The place was almost empty, 30 out from 32 attraction was working. All staff was very good! Pros: Payments buy a barcode scanner. Nice attractions No need to wait in line Cons: The food and drinks prices are high. In October there's is only the \"regulars \" staff and no more",
          "We had such a great day, brilliant slides and the kids loved it! Lifeguards really friendly too! Our boys are 8 and 5 and there was plenty of slides for them to go on! Only downside was the waves in the wave pool only came on once and we missed it!",
          "An excellent family outing that we all enjoyed. Very few queues and great rides for all ages. Good value for money. Would highly recommend it.",
          "Everything you need is inside. Food and drink prices are not big. Many different tubes, not large queues. Safe and nice place.",
          "Half an hour from hersonnisos where we were based. '\u20ac30 pp bus included. Wrist band for cashless payment is great and you know your running total as each receipt shows it at the bottom. Park has about 15 slides for adults, some with doughnuts p, some without. We had a great time",
          "Visited all slides and liked it. My older son was very happy with the visit. Some of the slides was not so good, especially those where you have to slide without a tire. But anyway we liked it very much!",
          "Booked Water City through our Thomas Cook holiday rep. We book love water parks so couldn't wait to go. We went at the end of September which is a bit out of season but it was fab as there were no queues for any rides. The weather was also great. So warm so you didn't mind",
          "We went at the end of September out of season and it was great no ques the pictures were abit pricey and the food and drinks were too but I love water parks so just ignored those parts... could do with a few more slides but really really enjoyed my day!!!",
          "We booked this trip through our jet2 holiday rep and it seemed OK on arrival. The rides themselves are reasonable but pools are dirty and the park is very run down. Broken parasols and sun beds in areas which could cause injury. Food and drink is quite expensive and prices are",
          "Visited in September with my boyfriend, had a fantastic day. No queues all day, just went down all the slides as many times as you want. Some very high and fast slides, perfect for fellow adrenaline junkies. Lots of sunloungers available too and places to eat and drink. Food",
          "This place is starting to show its age. A little work down. We went with our young children and compared to Limnoupolis in Chania, it didn't allow kids to join adults on the larger slides. So it was kind of boring for them. But if you are into adrenaline rushes, you will find a",
          "Came here while on holiday. it was a brilliant water park. nice and big .only slight problem you couldn't get any dingys all the European people used them for the rides and carried them around all day as well as some of them Que jumping. but all in all it was nice.",
          "Didn't look great on arrival but actually was great fun. Money on wrist bands was good but be careful as you don't know what you are spending ! Food was pretty awful !",
          "We had a great day here quite expensive to get in but apparently if you ask your hotel you can get 10% vouchers off for here! Took us an hour to drive here in the hills and you would never know it is there until you get to the front door! Rides are excellent my 7 year old loved",
          "Totally loved this water park. We travelled for hour and half to visit and wasn't disappointed at all. The kids had a brilliant time, you don't need to worry about carrying cash with you as everything is paid for via scanning your entrance wristband and then totalled up at the",
          "No majorly scary rides although a good park for young kids especially if they can swim and are over 110cm tall. drinks and food can be expensive. Very enjoyable day out.",
          "Enjoyed the water park , had a good system of no money and the staff just scanned barcodes on your wrist band when you wanted something to eat or drink . Rides were good and it wasn't too busy when we went either ! Good day out",
          "We went here to keep the teenager in the family quiet and we ended up loving it OK a small but expensive and certainly was packed with queues per ride but was really enjoyable Not sure on the he suitability for smaller kids but according to the teenager in the family it was",
          "Had a lovely day out here whilst on holiday in Gouves. All rides were fun and the queues were short. Charge everything to the wristband so no need for cash and although food was a bit pricey you got plenty!!",
          "Fantastic day out ! Booked through our travel rep Avra travel the night before we went and we were collected a few hundred yards from our hotel in Gouves the next morning. The bus up to the mountains was a nice part of the trip also with the great views too. While at the park it",
          "Booked through our Thomas Cook rep after we tried to 'go it alone' only to be informed that none of the normal buses go up the mountain to Watercity. For the park itself and pre booked bus ride I think 35 Euros is a bit steep. The day we had booked for was overcast most of the",
          "We booked with a travel rep in stalis which included bus transfers,very clean water park,good variety of slides,offer a cashless system wristband so you can scan it for drinks and pay at the end,free sunbeds ,lockers only 3. \u20ac and a 2\u20ac deposit,plenty of toilets,sunbeds and",
          "BEWARE IF PAYING ONLINE !!!!!! The Waterpark is great, however, I paid on the website and I got a message to say that the transaction did not go through. I paid again and then later saw that both payments had been taken from my account. I emailed them to explain and told them",
          "We went in June, it wasnt too busy. No big ques so not really any waiting times. The food was fairly reasonably priced for those sorts of places and so were the pictures. It looks clean and well run. My only problem with it is the wristbands. One of my friends had around 40Euros",
          "The children and I had a marvellous time. They are not the best swimmers but there were children's pools with water slides and a tunnel which they loved. There was also a quieter pool for them. It was extremely well organised with transportation from and to the hotel. A great",
          "Excellent park with great facilities, over 30 slides. Even during August the place was not crowded. Enough to do both for toddlers and older kids.",
          "We went here as a family of 4 who enjoy waterparks whilst on holiday. As others have said you need to use a SatNav / Google maps to find the park as it is off the beaten track but once you get there there is a huge car park. Lockers were 2 Euro and one held all of our stuff",
          "Great place for all kids and adults, many water slides for all ages. Best recommend to come here at the morning when it's open and leave at noon",
          "Visited here as a family of 4 with kids aged 10 and 8. Overall we had a ball and left exhausted after going on virtually all the slides. Food options were pretty good although not cheap. Some staff were very good - one chap was the bottom of the hyper race slide and made",
          "we decided to have a day out at the water park and we were not disappointed. We booked through our tour operator which cost us a little more but by the time you take into consideration your transport cost there was not much difference. The Park is slightly off the beaten track",
          "Visited today and had a great day. Got there just before 10am when it opened and kids went on everything before it got more crowded later! Really clean in all areas... Toilets checked and cleaned regularly during the day. Lifeguards doing a good job too! Plenty to keep everyone",
          "Great set of slides for adults and children, all the equipment new and well-kept. Lockers are big enough to handle my backpack (you'll get a padlock and a key on the ribbon, I tied it around my wrist and sticked behind a watch so it wasn't cumbersome to carry it on my own or",
          "We have 2 boys age 15 and 9 and we all loved it, we got there as it opened on a Sunday and it was quite for a short time but it never got busy enough for us to be waiting long for a ride, the lifeguards were nice and there was plenty of rubber rings when needed throughout the",
          "Great day out all the slides and swiming areas really entertain those bored at the beach. But don't lose the wrist band a hefty 100 euro fine as each band has a 100 euro credit for food drink and items from the shops. Great so so you don't have to carry cash or card",
          "We paid online before we got there saving a few euros. Once in, you are given a wristband and this is scanned for any drinks, food you have. You pay when you leave. All the rides were fantastic fun, well looked after and with guards on all who were very vigilant about height,",
          "We visited in the height of summer and the park wasn't too busy with plenty of sun loungers and not major queues. Good choice of slides! Lifeguards are all super attractive haha. Negatives for me were the dirty pools, slides and water. Thee price and choice of food. And the",
          "This water park is such a good one. There is all types of water slides for everyone and every level of thrill you are wanting to seek! I would highly recommend you visit this water park. However please note to get to the top of each slide there is a VERY steep hill every time",
          "We had a fantastic time there. Plenty of space and, even in August, no really long queues. Food and drink not too badly priced once inside either.",
          "We spent one day in the park and it was the best/most fun day in Crete. At the end of the day we ware tired and smiling, what more could you ask for. Lots of slides, but the food was not that good. You need minimum 6 hours!",
          "Kids had a great time...and adults as well!! A huge water park, well organized, not having to pay for anything (everything charged in your wrist band to pay on departurure), delicious hot dogs, would only prefer also salty crepes but for the rest everything was fantastic!",
          "My boyfriend and I are on our first holiday together and couldn't miss a chance for a day at the waterpark. Some hotels and shops offer \u20ac36 for entry and transfer but DO NOT TAKE THIS! Others offer \u20ac28 for both and it was a lovely air conditioned bus and we were at the park from",
          "There are a lot of slides where you can have some fun. The food is very good and everything you buy is scanned on you wrist band and you'll pay at the end, when you leave. For extra 3 euros, you can get a locker to put your things there. It closes a bit early, at 18:30, but if",
          "Really enjoyed the waterpark! Lots of slides and sunbeds. Food really good and cheap. Staff were all helpful and polite. Would highly recommend",
          "This is the largest waterpark on Crete but even with that accolade it struggles to provide more than a few hours entertainment. We visited with two twelve year olds who enjoyed themselves but were somewhat underwhelmed. What is good - a few newer rides (head to the far left of",
          "Excellent water park. Plenty to do for all ages. Loads of sun loungers with umbrellas. Wrist bands which you can use to pay for food and drinks and pay before you leave. Plenty of toilets and showers to use at the entrance.",
          "We visited the park the 18th of August. And we had a fun time on all the rides and there's hardly a long line to wait. The bad things is people hold onto rubber rings which larger people need the blue ones which there's not many of these. Staff should be taking these off",
          "I took my 6 year old and he was tall enough for almost every single slide (120cm). The staff were really welcoming and fun, the prices weren't out of control and the locker system was really good They give you a wrist band, you scan that instead of using money and pay at the",
          "Went with my daughter. Had a great time. Surprisingly the queues to go on the rides were not too bad. However a little disappointed on the waves machine which happened approx every hour. The good thing is the wrist band which gets scanned every time you buy food or gifts so",
          "we had a great day here lots of slides annoying a 12yr old is classed as an adult and his not very tall is a little unfair. overall worth a visit",
          "I visited Watercity whilst on holiday in Crete, and I certainly was not disappointed! The waterpark uses a wristband system, which is scanned whenever you purchase an item from the shop or a eating area. It is then scanned when you exit the park, and you pay the amount that",
          "Located on a hill top, the water park is offering a very nice day out. Despite my hesitation I was surprised to find out how nice the place was... The staff is friendly and helpful, the location is great and there are plenty of attraction for the kids . Bottom line- great value",
          "We arrived at the wAter park at 10...there was no queues for the rides...the rides are really good. The food and drink is very reasonable. The park is in the middle of no where. You pay to go in and they give you a wrist band with a bar code on....so you don't need to carry",
          "I love theme parks but water parks I find a bit annoying. Queuing for ages whilst shivering, climbing loads of stairs. Whiplash, bumped heads, elbows, nose enemas and wedgies! So why go, well when DH promises DD2 it's going to happen then it's going to happen! So we were",
          "We found about the park in the airport as there are banners and advertising brochures everywhere. We called the park and apparently is cheeper to book online. So we booked online and called them to tell us how to get there. Apparently they run a bus and It only cost us 8\u20ac pp",
          "Big size water park (i think the biggest in that area) with lots of space and sunbeds so doesn't feel over crowded. Water park has lots of pools to cool off. Good food and very decent prices for a water park. Rides are decent and fun but nothing too thrilling or scary. so if",
          "Great day, not too much people, lots of sunbed available, the floor is not too hot (shoes not required) the bad point for me it's the water is salty :( (also into shower and toilet!) You can pay all along your day for food by your wristband (you will pay at exit area) Lockers",
          "It's an ok water park. Slides are not particularly thrilling, but my kids had a great time, so a good day out. What was annoying is that my 9 year old daughter had to pay full price, since they charge on size. So be prepared to pay full prize if your kids are over 140 cm. In",
          "Good fun. Decent variety of runs, though no really scary ones. Wrist band system is very good. No cash to be carried around. Only down side, is the queue to settle those bands on the way out is very slow!!",
          "It's a good family day out with plenty of rides for everyone. They all have a rating so if you want adrenaline thrills or mild kid rides you know the ones to pick. No money needed it's wristband operated so you pay at the end of your day. There's lockers for valuable items.",
          "This water park is OK. Floor VERY hot during the day and you are unable to carry flip flops around. Very long queues for rides. Very fussy over which colour dingy you can take on which rides. Not a lot of slides available. Uncomfortable sunbeds.",
          "Entry for two adults and one child was \u20ac81. Food was pricey and not tasty at all. Very high slides which brings a lot of adrenaline for someone who can't swim. Not very family friendly but if you went with a group of friends you would have a blast",
          "Average day out, as each and every one of the staff were so miserable, coming from a happy guy I couldn't believe how rude they all were , and really how much does it cost to put a smile on your face? \"Nothing\"...... Just for me and my partner it was exactly \u20ac100 for the day",
          "Everything you need from a water park. Slides for the grown ups, teenagers and children. Big pools to cool off. Clever idea as well for scanning all your purchases on a wristband. Food not to pricey for a water park. Would recommend.",
          "A very good place to spend a day especially if you are travelling with children. Lots of water slides of all kinds, bearable queues and suitable fast food cafes. Be prepared for tones of adrenaline splash :) Shuttle service from most of the hotels.",
          "Great day was had by all at this great water park. Windy as on top if a hill but loads to do and plenty of sun beds. Slight lack of rubber rings as people hang onto them and the lazy river is do lazy it doesn't push you around. Clean and tidy. Food expensive but good. Just",
          "Had such a great day at water city! Lots of choice of slides and also the system they have in the park of payment is amazing!!! You are given a wrist band on arrival with a bar code and then through out the day anything you buy in the park is scanned ( they even have",

          "Upside: Great water park, loads to do and heaps of fun. Photographer really nice. Downside: miserable staff, no direction where to get tubes and you need different tubes for different rides, theres no signs so you get to the top with the wrong tube and get sent back down to",
          "Brought my 31 yr old son and his girlfriend and my daughter 27 here June 2016 and we all had a blast! We love water parks and this one was no exception. Good system for payment having barcoded bracelets for charging food etc and paid on exit. Great rides although some are",
          "I came here with my daughter. It was the best day of my holiday. It took quite a while to get here from my hotel in Heraklion but it was well worth it. The staff are really friendly, the facilities are clean and had a good size changing room. There is also a restaurant and a",
          "My girlfriend and I were contemplating whether to go to Aqcua Plus or Watercity - we asked a few of the locals and they mostly recommended Watercity, so we chose to go there. We weren't disappointed - the different activities they had were definitely varied - slides for all",

          "Had a fantastic day out here. There were virtually no queues for the slides and such a relaxed vibe, which was a nice change from the usual chaotic vibe that you get at water/theme parks. If you get tired of the water slides there are lots of areas where you can chill out and",
          "We went here on a Sunday which seems to when most people are either coming or leaving Crete. That meant that there was very little queuing for the slides. The park seems well run and the slides are well maintained and great fun. The food and drinks are reasonable enough and the",
          "When our teenagers requested a trip to a water park, we did inwardly groan! We were staying near rethymnon and felt it was quite a distance to travel. However we decided to hire a car and head there. It was easy to find without sat nav - we only had the flyer map and went",
          "We visited the park on a day trip organised by our tour operator when staying on Crete. The park itself was a lot smaller than it looks on the brochures but there were still enough rides and things to do to keep us occupied for the 6 hours we were there. It is expensive but",
          "After consideration of Watercity vs Aquaplus, we have decided to choose this one as it considered to be bigger and suits better my teens. Was good surprised to find well organized facility, big variety of attractions which difficult to expect while looking on a postoral Crete",
          "Had a great time worth money you can play all day rest all day enjoy all day just great fun drinks foods frendly staffs",

          "Pretty good day out in Crete with kids however not the busiest place so atmosphere a little dull. Plus side is queuing isn't a problem and the staff plus lifeguards are friendly and informative enough. The changing facilities are clean and the wristband idea is a nice touch.",
          "We took the kids to water city this year having taken them to Aqua world last year. This park is far better. It is much cleaner, staff are friendly and good with kids. We were advised to take younger kids to aqua world but we would ignore that advice.This place is much more",
          "We had a great time at Watercity - there were plenty of rides and the park isn't massive which means you don't end up walking for miles! The food and drinks are a reasonable price for an attraction and you don't have to worry about carrying money around as you get bands which",
          "Everything inside the park was extremely expensive!!!! Maybe half the portion size of the food (as you get so much, couldn't eat half of mine) and half the price. The slides were good, except having to push yourself down the slides due to hardly any water going down. The slides",
          "The place is big but the variety is not so big. The main issue is the prices of every thing they sell. Price are very high !!! Food and drinks. When you get in they give you a digital bracelet that they scan each time you or one of your juds buy. So be careful with your kids and",
          "The slides here were fun, some extremely fast!! :-) The park was a lot smaller then what I thought, however I still had a fun day and went on a lot of slides more then once! Longest a I queued was only a couple of minutes, if that! You don't have to carry any cash around as they",
          "15 euros the adults and 10 per kid so it is a bit expensive for a family plus what you are going to spend inside in snacks etc. They only have two toilets so it was a bit tiring having to cross the whole park to go to toilet and they dont have toilets for children.",

          "Recently visited this water park in Greece and it was brilliant! I thought the layout of the park was superb and the rides were fun and thrilling. We paid our ticket money at the entrance but were given a band with a bar code so if you wanted to purchase drinks, food, lockers,",
          "Great waterpark, very clean, plenty of rings etc and good systems in place. Good lifeguards but wouldn't hurt them to smile a bit more - you'd think they were prison guards some of them. Went on a quiet day which is probably a good thing. Food and drink extortionately priced",
          "We came here with our three old daughter and have to say it was great for her with the kids pool and slides and it was great fun for us too there was only two negatives against the water park it was expensive to get in the park and the food and drink was very expensive just",

Lost of cameramen and photos are \u20ac8 euro for 1 to be printed or \u20ac6 for 1 on a disk. Lots of sunbeds so",
          "Visited watercity today and it lived up to my expectations. There were a variety of slides, pools and water activities. Food and drink is a little pricey, but it usually is at most attractions. The park is fairly clean and there are plenty of mini slides for smaller children who",
          "It's OK, good for small kids I'd say but there's not masses of slides and can get round the park in a couple of hours. The pay system is really good as you don't have to carry cash, everything is reasonably priced (except Fanta lemon at 3.30\u20ac a bottle \ud83d\ude1f) and the food is nice",
          "Well all I can really say about Watercity was the view at the top of the mountain where Watercity is was a lovely stunning view other than that we only got to the gate & discovered after a 35-40 minute drive there that it was closed despite their own website saying it was open.",
          "Great for all ages lots to do great water park ques not to bad lots of sunbeds resturant and drinks available lots for little ones as well",
          "This is the typical adventure water park. Thus if the one is fan of water slides and other similar water attractions this is definitely right place. On the other hand if visitor look for more restful spa environment he/she should likely choose diferent type of aquapark.",
          "This water park is really good and reasonably priced. The slides were all good and you wasn't queuing for long to get on a slide. Food at the on site cafes were good you get a wristband when you go in which becomes your bank card so you pay for everything on the wristband then",
          "Many water slides. Some of them might be really scary - kamikaze, bumerango. But its worth to overcome fears. There are many sunbeds for rest a little bit. Toilets, showers and especially lockers should be refreshed.",
          "Have been coming to Watercity since 1996, always a great day, friendly staff, great slides and gorgeous female life guards \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "We loved this water park it was the best one we have been to in Malia area, we visited the 1st week of September it was grate because it weren't to busy, they take photos of you that you can buy at the end, they are great we had to buy them. we would definitely visit hear again",
          "Have been to 2 other water parks on crete (limnopoulis near chania which is great but was closed) and aqua plus (went last year and didn't like it). Water city did not disappoint. I, like another reviewer, was surprised my daughter (age 12) had to pay full price. She is taller",
          "Fantastic visit, quieter than mid season so we were very impressed with the no que's, helpful staff, friendly, clean, organised, helpful, safe. I was bitten by a spider and I was worried, because I am a worrier standard, but the doctor was so helpful and friendly. Loved the",
          "We recently visited Watercity as part of our family holiday. First disappointment was they charred full adult rate for my 11 year old daughter as they base their price on the height of the child. The second disappointment was the number of wateslides that were not in use and",
          "As it wasn't peak season it was nice and quiet which meant hardly any queues for the rides. There aren't a huge amount of rides so I can imagine in peak season it would become tiresome waiting to go on each one. The electronic wristband system was a great idea although it was",
          "Definitely the highlight of our stay in Crete. Both my wife and I enjoyed the place very much. Quite a choice of different slides from scary ones to the ones that you can chill and relax, like lazy river. Moneyless system works great, as far as you check the prices and are aware",
          "As I was in malia for a week I thought why not try out the local waterpark and as this was the closest (45 min bus journey) and quite cheap (30 euros) We tried it out. At first we got picked up from McDonald Which I thought was abit dodgy but set off around 11am to the park. On",
          "This is an excellent water park. The rides are not only fun but also well maintained. They have all of the facilities you need: Lockers, toilets, a shop, eateries. everything is well maintained and clean. The prices are also reasonable: 25 Euros for an adult, 17 for kids (our 6",
          "We went Monday and were surprised how quiet it was. Virtually no queuing and we could race around from one slide to the next no bother. Food can be expensive but overall a good day out.",
          "We booked our trip here last week at 30 euros each. Well worth the admission price. Loved the fact you can leave your money in the secure lockers and pay for your food etc at the end by the wristband. Great slides, loved the 30ft drop on the big red one, the kids loved the ariel",
          "We only went to Watercity to escape from our awful hotel for a day and had a really good day. My wife enjoyed just relaxing while my son dragged me from one slide to the next. Although some queues appeared long the wait times were more than acceptable. My only small complaint is",
          "This is by far the biggest water park that I have ever seen, and it is the best! The staff are very friendly and the rides are so much fun. There are many rides for all ages including very fast ones for those who love fast rides. This is a must see.",
          "We paid for transfer and entrance with a total cost of around \u20ac38. This was a bit pricey, but seeing as we were at the other end of the island, it made sense to get the coach transfer. This picked us up at just gone ten, arrived at around half eleven, and departed at 5pm so you",
          "A fab range of slides, really well organised water park, with colour coded floats for the big slides which means shorter queues. Everything charged to a barcode on your wristband when inside the park which makes it really easy to enjoy the water without worrying about money etc.",
          "Lovely clean, spacious water park. We arrived around 11am and it was really quiet, so got a great choice of sunbeds. It's located quite high up on the hills overlooking Hersonissos - our taxi driver was kind enough to stop near the top so we could take photos! Our children loved",
          "We liked it so much we went back for a second visit! Worthwhile pre-booking tickets online as it's much cheaper. Kept us and our 2 boys entertained all day, and the queues weren't too bad even in the middle of the day in peak season. Almost no queues before 11am and after",
          "Much better than we expected. Lots of slides, not too busy and very clean. A good layout meant not too much walking. All staff were very helpful and friendly. Great for families. Also, the park has a 'no cash' policy. You scan your wristband with every purchase and you get a",
          "Considering the time of year it wasn't hectic so didn't have to cue long for rides. Food and drinks are pricey so take your own if you want to keep the costs down. 1 pizza big enough for two people. Purchase the water its 50cents and decent size bottle and cold. My 13 and 15",
          "We were umming and aahhing whether to go to Watercity or the other waterpark in Chania. Absolutely made the correct decision. Our rep steered us towards the Chania one, but our six year old who can just about swim could go on most rides and absolutely loved it. Queues were no",
          "We did this trip as an excursion from the hotel. All but one of the rides was open although the wave pool rarely ran. We went on a Friday and we rarely waited more than 5 minutes queuing with some rides having no waiting time at all. Some rides require you to have the right",
          "Don't go with a holiday company trip as very expensive. We wished we'd got a taxi or gone with a local trip. Good variety of slides - particularly liked the crazy river, the hyper race, the sidewinder-boomerango and the turbocyclone but we were expecting the park to be",
          "We've been at water city 4 days ago. We had fun in the slides. After a while my 9 years old daughter played in one of the simplest slide. When she was sliding down her hair was caught in the fan under the water and she was stuck there for 20 second. Luckily, there was an alert",
          "Really enjoyed our afternoon here before we left Crete. A super end to a great holiday. Excellent rides, some thrills to be had here! Food rather pricey, try and take your own. But water was cheap (50 cents per small bottle).",
          "We booked to visit Watercity while in Crete to keep 10 year old son happy.... And it turned out to be an awesome day! I'm 47 and had as much fun as he did! There's everything from the tamest of tame rides to the most extreme - ranked green, amber, red with green being the",
          "I came here with my boyfriend a couple of days ago and after being really excited because we love waterparks we were really disappointed. We paid \u20ac33 each which included the transfer and ticket in to the waterpark. The park itself is ALOT smaller than what it appears on the map.",
          "Consider renting a car for the journey - we got a transfer coach and it took about 2 1/2 hours, stopping at what felt like every hotel in crete!! I mapped it and we were only 1 hour and 7 minutes away from our start point!! There is lots of variety at the park and the queuing",
          "There is two main choices of water parks when in Crete and they both have their values but this one is far more family oriented and the buying system with the wrist band then pay at the end is very handy. Really good rides and facilities. Enjoy",
          "Tidy , clean, not too overcrowded. Lots of slides which were fun. Wish there was a ride which would have a family tyre, or took more than one or two people at a time. Lazy river a little too slow. The wave pool could have been less tame and because there was a zip wire going",
          "Loved this place! Fab slides, music and food... Highly recommend! The park uses wrist bands to pay for your food and photos etc which is very handy so you don't have to go back up to the lockers to get money... However I missed this and walked back up to get mine!! Can be an",
          "The place is well equipped with several water slides some of them thrilling. The staff is very helpful and friendly and the eating and drinking facilities are highly convenient. Paradise for thrill seeking kids.",
          "Nice setting up in the hills, cool breeze was very welcoming but make sure you have sun cream on. Slides are quite good none are really scary but enjoyable, don't have to queue for too long. Park seems clean enough and fairly well maintained. Have been to better water parks",
          "Beautifully clean, well life guarded, not too crowded, even on the first week of English Summer holidays. Lots to do for all ages.... Our children are 7,11,11,13 and 14 and they all had a superb time. There's plenty of rings.... Just remember to take a double yellow up to",
          "Fun and different types of slides and water activities for young and old, bold and timid! The only thing I would fault is the catering... not very good food/beverages but all prices were good.",
          "We visited in late June and the water was a little cold but the kids had a great time. A bit far from downtown but excellent service, very clean, neat, good services, very loved children.",
          "Went here with my partner and had plenty to do from 11am until 5pm. The food is not great but the rides are fun and had plenty areas to sunbathe too. Would recommend for families with either very young kids or pre teens. Age 7 to 10 may not get on all rides that they want to.",
          "Came here on the day before we went home (20th June). We all had a fantastic day out and would definitely come back here if I was to return to Crete! Tip: This waterpark is more suitable for older people (10+) as the slides are big and thrill seeking! (Younger children would",
          "I wouldn't recommended taking small children to this place, a lot of the slides are dangerous, especially the red, blue and white smallish one, I went down it and as I was about halfway down it was being completely drenched in water and couldn't breath and when you finish you",
          "The slides are fantastic, we really enjoyed the whole day. Transfer bus is not on time, you probably have to wait for it even half an hour!",
          "So booked through our tour operator Olympic and got a private cab there and the coach back. Got through quickly waited 5 mins for the locker which I didn't think the was bad for 3\u20ac. Thought all of the water slides was brilliant never had to wait more than 5 mins for any of them.",
          "We came on a trip booked from a travel agent in Stalis. The cost including transfers and entrance fee was 29 euros per person. We arrived at the Water park just before opening time so had to wait for about 10 minutes before we could go in. During that time we were given our",

          "Here on a welcome day away from Malia. Great waterpark, virtually no queues and quiet when we visited. The band system was good meaning you dont need cash. The food was tasty, on the pricy side but good. Lifeguards helpful all but one who was exceptionally rude and incredibly",
          "Visited here on 16/6/15 and it was bizarrely very quiet. This meant that we barely had to queue for any of the slides which was a huge positive. My only fault with this water park is the temperature the paths got to, they became almost impossible to walk around on, especially",
          "Bizarrely it was really quiet, good for us though and no queues , food was ok , as you would expect , friendly staff. 133 euros for 2 adults and two teenagers plus transport.",
          "We went to the water city park just after it had opened for the season. We were quite impressed at the size and facilities. Your wristband has a barcode so you can leave all you valuables locked away in your own locker which costs 3 Euro for the day. The water is not heated so",
          "We visited water city with the kids this summer. Very close to the city of Heraklion and can be accessed either by car or by bus. It was busy as expected, however, the first kids pool was dirty and in the second there were tiles broken. In some of the slides it was very",

          "A lovely water park, 20 minutes drive from Heraklion, Crete. Few tips: 1. Try the colorful slides with or without the tubes (there are two of them). 2. Food and stuff are not cheap at all, if you are on a budget trip suggest you bring your own food and drinks with you. 3. My",
          "The park is cleaned and mostly well maintained. There is enough fun for kids and adults. No real extreme rides though. The \"hydrotubes and freefall\" attraction was in a really bad shape, the slide parts are not fitting perfectly therefore causing injuries. You can see the big",

          "This is such a fun place to go , the slides are good and there is lots of variety, if you want to take the slow pace then just hop into the lazy river and enjoy the ride , prices are ok , no different to any other theme park charges , food and drink choices are good , lifeguards",
          "We got a taxi to watercity, hidden away right in the hills. Had to pay adult price for my 12yr old as they charge on height rather than age! Enjoyed all the slides and they were well managed by lifeguards but I did feel it was slightly dated. When you enter they give you a",

          "Booked a day out to the park through our rep. Park is a reasonable size but a whole day is to long, half a day is plenty. Lockers are available. No order to the queuing system. some slides are beside each other but nothing to indicate at the start of the queue what you are",
          "Clean park, well maintained, good idea with wrist bands and lockers, no stress with keeping an eye on belongings. Saw the photo area where it said you can look at photos of yourselves on the computer from your day at the park and get on disc....thought great! no camera to carry",

          "We have been here in the past and the place is looking a little dated. I like the introduction of wrist bands for paying for all purchases within the park. The queuing for the rides could be better organised and they should think about cooling the stones underfoot whilst you are",
          "Money well spent. Prices in the park suprisingly good. Good selection of slides for all ages & abilities. Daughter unfortunately sliced her foot in one pool but lifeguards were really helpful & practically carried her to first aid. Great system of just scanning your wristband",

I believe the prices are higher than the value for money analogy, especially for a family where several tickets would have to be paid in advance just to enter inside the park.

          "It's fun for the whole family. We have a wonderful time there everytime. The only issue is that it is a bit pricey as with all water parks. Highly recommend for families with children. Make sure to book the entrance tickets online though",

          "Isn't made out how it actually is in the adverts, actually really small, sun beds are from the 50's! Food was pretty good, what you'd expect really. They have a cashless system with wrist bands which is much better than using money! Wouldn't personally return.",
          "Perfect. Great food with good price. Very clean and tidy.\nNot to crowded, very fun, even managed to do all of the slides.",

Bathroom conditions are decent, fairly old. One of the few really nice things is the view. Is is situated on some high hill and it looks nice",
          "A bit pricey but worth it! Excellent alternative for spending a day instead of the beach, especially when the wind is too annoying for the beach. Remember to apply the sun screen frequently, the shade is very limited and water is not helping.",

When it\u2019s hot your feet will burn on the floor so bring some flip flops or sliders. Also the music is awful and very loud so mentally prepare yourself for a holiday with bad Greek songs stuck in your head.",

          "Pros:\n-Slides are fun and exciting.\n-Location is close to the city of Irakleion\nCons:\n-Food is no good and expensive. Only pizza is ok but still expensive for the size of it.\n-Sunbeds are old and torn. Need to be changed.",
          "exceptional....excellent for single couple or family entertainment...full day excursion",
          "Not bad but not the best. On first sight it looks awesome but it is quite old. I would expect more advanced technologies such as sensors and green/red lights on attractions but it was all depending on humans. Slides for kids is another \u2026",
          "Fun fun fun",

          "Such a wonderful place to spend a hot summer day! The staff is kind and always take care of safety. There are many different amuzing and ranked by height and age slides, like the little children pool, which includes some smaller slides, \u2026",

        "wiki": "Phaistos (Greek: \u03a6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, pronounced [fe\u02c8stos]; Ancient Greek: \u03a6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, pronounced [p\u02b0ai\u032fst\u00f3s], Minoan: PA-I-TO?), also transliterated as Phaestos, Festos and Latin Phaestus, is a Bronze Age archaeological site at modern Faistos, a municipality in south central Crete. Ancient Phaistos was located about 5.6 km (3.5 mi) east of the Mediterranean Sea and 62 km (39 mi) south of Heraklio, the second largest city of Minoan Crete. The name Phaistos survives from ancient Greek references to a city in Crete of that name at or near the current ruins.\nThe name is substantiated by the coins of the classical city. They display motifs such as Europa sitting on a bull, Talos with wings, Heracles without beard and being crowned, and Zeus in the form of a naked youth sitting on a tree. On either the obverse or the reverse the name of the city, or its abbreviation, is inscribed, such as \u03a6\u0391\u0399\u03a3 or \u03a6\u0391\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0399, for Phaistos or Phaistios (\"Phaistian\" adjective) written either right-to-left or left-to-right. These few dozen coins were acquired by collectors from uncontrolled contexts. They give no information on the location of Phaistos.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nPhaistos was located by Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, commander of the Spitfire, a paddle steamer, in the Mediterranean Survey of 1853, which described the topography, settlements and monuments of Crete. Spratt followed the directions of Strabo, who said:Of the three cities that were united under one metropolis by Minos, the third, which was Phaestus, was razed to the ground by the Gortynians; it is sixty stadia distant from Gortyn, twenty from the sea, and forty from the seaport Matalum; and the country is held by those who razed it.\nThe simple geometric problem posed by these distances from known points was solved with no difficulty by the survey. The location pinpointed was the eastern end of a hill, or ridge, rising from the middle of the Geropotamos river valley extending from the sea to the Messara Plain in an east\u2013west direction. The hill was called Kastri (\"fort\", \"small castle\"). A military man, Spratt understood the significance of the location immediately:I thus found that Phaestus had occupied the extremity of a ridge that divides the maritime plain of Debaki from the plain of the Messara, so as to command the narrow valley of communication.\nA village of 16 houses remained on the ridge, but the vestiges of fortification walls indicated a city had once existed there. A half-century later, after removing the houses, Federico Halbherr and his crew began to discover the remains of an extensive palace complex. As he had begun excavation before Arthur Evans at Knossos in 1900, he did not have the advantage of Evans' concepts of Minoan civilization nor the knowledge acquired after the decipherment of the Linear B syllabary by Michael Ventris. Excavation ended in 1904, to begin again after another half-century, in 1950. By this time it was understood that the palace had been constructed at the beginning of the Proto-Palace Period. After 1955 the place name, \ud800\udc1e\ud800\udc02\ud800\udc35, pa-i-to, interpreted as Phaistos (written in Mycenaean Greek), began to turn up in the Linear B tablets at Knossos, then under the Mycenaean Greeks. There was every reason to think that pa-i-to was located at Kastri.\nNo Linear B has been found at Phaistos, but tradition and the Knossos tablets suggest that Phaistos was a dependency of Knossos. Moreover, only a few pieces of Linear A have been found. As Phaistos appears to have been an administrative center, the lack of records is surprising.\nIn 1908, Pernier found the Phaistos Disc in the basements of the northern group of the palace. This artifact is a clay disk, dated to between 1950 BC and 1400 BC and impressed with a unique, sophisticated hieroglyphic script.\nThe tombs of the rulers of Phaistos were found in a cemetery 20 minutes away from the palace remains.\n\n\n== Bronze Age ==\nPhaistos was inhabited from about 4000 BC. A palace, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, was destroyed by an earthquake during the Late Bronze Age. Knossos along with other Minoan sites was destroyed at that time. The palace was rebuilt toward the end of the Late Bronze Age.\nThe first palace was built about 2000 BC. This section is on a lower level than the west courtyard and has a nice facade with a plastic outer shape, a cobbled courtyard, and a tower ledge with a ramp, which leads up to a higher level. The old palace was destroyed three times in period of about three centuries. After the first and second disaster, reconstruction and repairs were made, so there are distinguished three construction phases.\nThe Old Palace was built in the Protopalatial Period, then rebuilt twice due to extensive earthquake damage. When the palace was destroyed by earthquakes, the re-builders constructed a New Palace atop the old.\nSeveral artifacts with Linear A inscriptions were excavated at this site. The name of the site also appears in partially deciphered Linear A texts, and is probably similar to Mycenaean 'PA-I-TO' as written in Linear B. Several kouloura structures (subsurface pits) have been found at Phaistos. Pottery has been recovered at Phaistos from in the Middle and Late Minoan periods, including polychrome items and embossing in imitation of metal work. Bronze Age works from Phaistos include bridge spouted bowls, eggshell cups, tall jars and large pithoi.In one of the three hills of the area, remains of the middle neolithic age have been found, and a part of the palace was built during the Early Minoan period. Another two palaces seems to have been built at the Middle and Late Minoan Age. The older looks like the Minoan palace of Knossos, although this is smaller. An earthquake c. 18th century BC destroyed the palace but a larger palace of the later Minoan period was built on the ruins around 1700 BC, consisting of several rooms separated by columns.\nThe levels of the theater area, in conjunction with two splendid staircases, gave a grand access to the main hall of the propylaea through high doors. A twin gate led directly to the central courtyard through a wide street. The floors and walls of the interior rooms were decorated with plates of sand and white gypsum stone. Upper floors of the west sector had spacious ceremonial rooms, although their exact restoration was not possible.\nA brilliant entrance from the central courtyard led to the royal apartments in the north part of the palace, with a view of the tops of Psiloritis. The rooms were constructed from alabaster and other materials. The rooms for princes were smaller and less luxurious than the rooms of the royal departments.\nAround 1400 BC, the invading Achaeans destroyed Phaistos, as well as Knossos. The palace appears to have been unused thereafter, as evidence of the Mycenaean era have not been found.\n\n\n== Iron Age ==\nReferences to Phaistos in ancient Greek literature are quite frequent. Phaistos is first referenced by Homer as \"well populated\", and the Homeric epics indicate its participation in the Trojan War. The historian Diodorus Siculus indicates that Phaistos, together with Knossos and Kydonia, are the three towns that were founded by King Minos on Crete. Instead, Pausanias and Stephanus of Byzantium supported in their texts that the founder of the city was Phaestos, son of Hercules or Ropalus. The city of Phaistos is associated with the mythical king of Crete Rhadamanthys.\nThe site was reinhabited during the Geometric Age (8th century BC). Phaistos had its own currency and had created an alliance with other autonomous Cretan cities, and with the king of Pergamon Eumenes II. Around the end of the 3rd century BC, Phaestos was destroyed by the Gortynians and since then ceased to exist in the history of Crete. Scotia Aphrodite and goddess Leto, who was also called Phytia, were worshiped there. The people of Phaistos were distinguished for their funny adages. Epimenides, the wise man invited by the Athenians to clean the city after the Cylonian affair (Cyloneio agos) in the 6th century BC, was of Phaistian descent.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmari\nKalyvia\nKamares, Crete\nMonastiraki, Crete\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAdams, E.

          "NOT WORTH VISITING IN THESE \"CORONA-TIMES\"!\n\nWe were here last year, we could go almost anywhere within the area and spent there more than one hour. We wanted to show this spectacular place to those who were not with us last year. This \u2026",
          "Epic view (as Henry Miller said too), ancient history, nice caf\u00e9",
          "A real ancient ruin with minimal reconstruction. So much better than Knossos which suffered from Evan's attempts to rebuild back in the 1920s",
          "The ruins of the ancient city at a hill with panoramic view of the area.",
          "One of the largest and most important Minoan sites, slightly reconstructed (not like Kn\u00f3ssos which is partially \"reimagined\"). Great place to learn about Minoan culture and history. Great views of Psiloritis and surrounding Messara plain.",
          "In contrast to Knossos palace quite empty.\nDue to Corona limited tour but still impressive.",
          "Perfect environment, feeling the history surround you.",
          "So so...8EUR entrance fee, it is expansive for it.",
          "Hard to imagine the former grandeur of this place among the rubble that is all that's left. Interesting only for hard-core archeologists or historians.",
          "unfortunately it is not so pleasant to go there, because it is very hot and no shade there :/ also all the artifacts are in museums, it is only the site with ruins, don't expect to see anything else.",
          "It was an enriching experience. Learning a lot about the people that lived there long ago.",
          "Ok. Not that interesting",
          "Firstly 8 euro fee is too much in my opinion. Ruins are  not in good condition and I believe this is correlated with the fact that in faistos compared with knossos has not been any human intervention . Ruins are \"originals\".also  Phaistos disk is located in central museum at Heraclion.",
          "There's not much left of this fantastic palace. Moreover, much of the ruins are ruined by the excessive use of metal and other non-natural elements to keep whatever is left covered from rain.",
          "Fascinating view of 4000 years of civilisation",
          "It's old, it's history and a beautiful scenery. If you are one for looking at historic sites then this is one to visit. As it is all so old it's not big structures but more foundation. As always it's your own imagination that let's you see what you see.",
          "Much quieter and less congested than Knossos.  The view of the valley is beautiful.  It would be helpful if there were a few more interpretive signs.",
          "It\u2019s rewarding the opportunity to discover such a remarkable place of humankind history.\nGo with time, protect yourself with a hat, sunblock and bring a bottle of water. Entrance costs 8 euros.",
          "Expectation management- most of the site is closed due to COVID-19. And the staff wouldn\u2019t say anything until you came out with disappointment. The staff there are also super unfriendly and laughed around when you complaint about the close of the site. It\u2019s not with going there, at least this year.",
          "If you are in the area this is worth the stop. Smaller than Knossos but without the crowds. Lots of descriptive signs to explain the ruins. Sits on a beautiful hill on the side of the valley.",
          "An unspoiled archeological site. Good explanations on signs. Beautiful flowers and vistas all around.",
          "We visited Phaistos instead of most famous Knossos. Phaistos is the same age of palace as like Knossos, but mostly all original (not rebuilt). The parking is very easy there near from palace's entrance with beautiful view around the oil \u2026",
          "In my opinion its better place than palace in Knossos everything looks untouched, not so much renovations and you can feel spirit of ancient times still those are ruins so not so much to watch",
          "Great little archeological site. Very quiet and on top of a hill with a great view of the entire valley and the surrounding areas. Friendly staff and a nice place to relax in and get away from the noise and crowds of tourists.",
          "A nice historical site, actually a lot better than the Knossos archaeological site",
          "It is a palace that people built it almost 6000 years ago. Just that fact gives you the chills. No marble etc. only what that hill had to offer, and the job the archeologists did to keep it up is stunning. A \"must go\" place in Crete if you like history",
          "Great area with lovely archaeological sites as well as amazing landscape views as well. I would recommend spending around 45mins-1:30 hours here. It can get pretty hot and sunny at times, but it's typically a nice weather.",
          "Amazing view. Great experience and worth the drive. The staff was polite and helpful and the Palace was much more relaxing than Knossos. It is also more original than Knossos and hasn't been reconstructed. So most of what you see is virtually untouched compared to Knossos.",
          "Interesting historical place to visit, even the museum shop is worth a visit.",
          "Good sized Minoan palace with many interesting artefacts.\nOpen from 8am to 8pm so best visited in late afternoon or evening to avoid exposure to the sun.\nThere is a good sized cafe and shop on site. Good views over fertile plain.",
          "Because of the Covid-19 and although we were only a dozen of people on the whole site, about a half of the site was closed. Most of the information was not accessible to public. There was no information that it was so, and still we paid the full price. This is very disappointing.",
          "A shame most sections were due to covid",
          "Beautiful place. Better than Knossos!",
          "Well worth a visit. Seems more authentic than Knossos because there is less restoration. Much quieter than Knossos too. The sign boards were very well placed and informative. The cafe area is very pleasant, toilets free...",
          "The restoration of the whole complex has been done in a way that doesn't affect the viewer in a bad way.\nCarefully written texts and very helpful on site guards offer you a lively experience.\nHad the chance to meet a wonderful lady - Voula \u2026",
          "Wow. What a beautiful place. Wasnt busy.",
          "Much more authentic and original than Knossos.  Spectacular location and views.  Would recommend visiting here rather than Knossos.",
          "Beautiful, quiet ruins of a Minoan palace. In the summer it's very hot but some trees offer some shade. The smoothies are very nice as well!\nSome reconstructions of the palace in color would be nice.",
          "Nice would be a simple expression! It made me wonder about the processes of life and the disappearance of an entire civilization. What if this place is a part of a cycle?",
          "Different from Knossos, herein you can find an authentic archeological site (without fake reconstructions)",
          "Fascinating historical site. A must see in Crete",
          "Second largest Minoian settlement in Crete - worth seeing in case you already have been to Knossos and still have not had enough history. Breathtaking views to surrounding countryside! The tour is ungided but there are information panels \u2026",
          "Waste of time and money. You cant go anywhere and there is literally nothing to see.",
          "Very nice historical site! Unfortunately, the opening hours derive from what you find online. The staff was friendly enough to sell us tickets at 18:15 just to announce that everyone has to leave at 18:30 sharp!",
          "8\u20ac for nothing special. It's nice to see but the informations about the Palast are only on info boards. No guided tour.",
          "Beautiful - must see!!",
          "Set in beautiful scenery and covering a huge area it is an endless source of interest. How did the builders place such huge stone blocks into walls and how did they get them to the top of a hill? There are a lot of steps and uneven \u2026",
          "I loved this place. It was bigger than expected. The fact that there are signs all over the ruins/archeological site with the proper description was great. It was not full of people like knossos. I guess is a little more outside town.",
          "Just loved it! It's authentic and beautiful! Don't forget to wear sunblock and a hat",
          "Interesting archeological excavation, which shows that people more than 4.000 years ago already knew what the prettiest spots were.",
          "Awesome experience in this place, everything is carefully explained and well preserved, to mention especially the King's and Queen's private apartments which are easy to figure out in your mind while looking at the ruins. Many symbols are \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit and taking a tour guide.  Very interesting place to visit if you have an interest in history.",
          "Beautiful Phaistos minoan palace",
          "Lovely area, enjoyed the drive through the mountains. Stopped and ate in a beautiful taverna and came to a Minoan palace!! very interesting area.",
          "Great landscape with a deep history",
          "The palace is fabulous.  Plenty to see and great views.  It is a peaceful area.  The large clay pottery is impressive.  A must see.",
          "Small but significant. Dates from 1900BC,but very well preserved. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Magical place. Even though we came around 17:00 it was very hot. This is the place where they discovered famous Phaistos Disc. This is where Minoan's lived 3500 years ago. Nice souvenir shop and restaurant. Beautiful vegetation.",
          "Very nice",
          "Actually one of the site you can't miss, but it can get a bit much if have seen others. Quite charming and interesting though.",
          "Incredible beauty",
          "A must visit place when in the region!",
          "It's a place you have to visit when on Crete. Comparing to Knossos it's less crowded and a lot more quiet, almost no reconstruction was done so you can see everything as it was excavated. You can also rest, drink good coffee and enjoy nice view from restaurant near exit.\nPersonally i like it more than Knossos.",
          "Pretty huge, I never heard about this: We got there by chance. Windy. Interesting outlooks around.",
          "Excellent for remains and views and good cafe too",
          "Superb archeological site. You can imagine that it was good to live there 1400 B.C.",
          "Wonderful place and atmosphere. More information is needed so that visitors can understand about its history and Minoan civilization.",
          "Really nice place, but make sure to come here just before the closing, because there is no shade at the site and you wouldn't stand long on the Cretan summer sun here. Opposite to Knossos palace, which is restored, this one is in ruins and \u2026",
          "The first palace was built about 2000 BC. This section is on a lower level than the west courtyard and has a nice facade with a plastic outer shape, a cobbled courtyard, and a tower ledge with a ramp, which leads up to a higher level. The \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit. More interesting than Knossos. It takes a little time to understand the layout (the maps on site could be much clearer), but one does get a real appreciation of the grandeur of the palace.",
          "This is an amazing site that cannot be missed!",
          "The bad experience started at the beginning, in front of us a couple from uk trying to get the tickets, they asked twice how much it was and the funny person in charge of the tickets said as a joke, three thousand!  They told him that they \u2026",
          "Set in wonderful countryside very interesting place to visit.",
          "8 Euros is way too much for what you get. In 30 minutes you are already done. Better go to Aptera Ruins. You get to see more (it s even a complete Amphitheater) and you pay 2 euros.\n\nThey seem to have more ruines here but they are closed to the public.",
          "Amazing but hard to tell what's real",
          "Would have liked to have more explanations, or a guided tour. As it was, the good thing was that you get quite close to history, in some parts you get to walk among the ruins.",
          "Very well preserved and very quiet place (we visited it in middle September).",
          "Amazing archeological site, better than Knossos (in my opinion). It's not been tampered with, and has a very peaceful atmosphere. You can really get a feel for what life may have been like for the Minoans. Definitely worth a visit and I \u2026",
          "was not open when I got there said open till 1700 hrs I was there at 1600\nno worries you could see plenty from hill\nlots of trash cans\nthat is nice at times hard to find\nwish rest rooms were open",
          "The better Knossos. Lesser People and clean toilets. Less restricted pave ways to explore the ruins.\nMust go if you visit Phaistos: Matala. Just 5min away and great coast.",
          "Too expensive",
          "Amazing history here & great knowledgeable guide",
          "8 euro the entrance for an adult. The place has a parking place and the view is magnificen almost 360 degrees. There is also a terrace to drink something after the visit but you really need a hat as it is extremely sunny.\nTake care of children's because there are plenty of rocks an almost like a labirint.",
          "Impressive Minoan remains. Good cafe with lovely views.",

          "Beautiful and very nice place",
          "Interesting cultural place",
          "Smaller excavation than Knossos.\nI would only recommend to visit it if you are really interested in the Minoan-era. The layout of the palace and its function is very similar to the one in Knossos.\nBut compared to Knossos there is almost \u2026",
          "Entry price 8 euros, it's better to come in the evening because it's hot in the afternoon, open until 20.00",
          "This is a large site. Not easily accessible due to steep paths and rough terrain on the site. Lots of information boards in Greek and English. Would have liked more information. There are ongoing digs so some parts closed off. Overall interesting and worth a visit.",
          "Heaven for all who love archaeology and history.  Inmense sized site, so make sure to wear good shoes.",
          "If you can choose between Knossos and Phaistos, we enjoyed Phaistos more",

          "Definately worth 1-2 hours or more.  A word of caution.  When we first arrived we stopped at the \"Main Gate\" parked, and walked into the ruins.  Not too much to see.  However, we didn't realize to continue driving up the hill another Km to \u2026",
          "Amazing civilization traces",

          "I just think it is so amazing that you just can walk around on these grounds, touch and feel the place, it always is a few degrees warmer here, so best go in the morning. It closes early! 5 oclock!",
          "This place was amazing. I loved the stray cats! The ruins were also pretty awesome. I enjoyed this location far more then Knossos.",
          "Full of tourist add you'd expect, nothing really to see, and what there is had been recreated.",
          "More then 4k years old! What more can I say? I like it even more than Knossos. It is less crowded and less restored.",

          "Great view, simple attraction with not too much to see. But worth to mention the historical visit",
          "If you love your history and archaeology you'll love this place. Was \u20ac8 to enter, which seemed a lot, though still cheaper then English Heritage entry fees in England. It's quite a large site so you can easily spend a couple or three hours there exploring, and the views are amazing.",

          "If you love history then you're bound to love it!",

          "Great interesting place",

          "This place feels more authentic than knosos as it hasn't been completely reimagined and built up with concrete. This place is an absolute must visit",
          "To be honest the ruins are pretty basic. It may be very old, but almost everything is destroyed. The explanations lack context and are too technical. If you are around, go there (8\u20ac), but don't make a longer trip just for that.",

          "Amazing place to visit and get a feel for Minoan life. Could do with more information on artifacts  found there.\n\nI would recommend visiting this place rather than it's ancient rival, Gortyna which was very frustrating and disappointing due to lack of access and development (unless you are an official archeologist digging there).",

Widely considered a giant of modern Greek literature, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in nine different years.Kazantzakis' novels included Zorba the Greek (published 1946 as Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas), Christ Recrucified (1948), Captain Michalis (1950, translated Freedom or Death), and The Last Temptation of Christ (1955).  He also wrote plays, travel books, memoirs and philosophical essays such as The Saviors of God: Spiritual Exercises. His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of Zorba the Greek (1964) and The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).\nHe translated also a number of notable works into Modern Greek, such as the Divine Comedy, Thus Spoke Zarathustra and the Iliad.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWhen Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in Kandiye, now Heraklion, Crete had not yet joined the modern Greek state (which had been established in 1832), and was still under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. From 1902 to 1906 Kazantzakis studied law at the University of Athens: his 1906 Juris Doctor thesis title was \u039f \u03a6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Law and the State\"). Then he went to the Sorbonne in 1907 to study philosophy. There he fell under the influence of Henri Bergson. His 1909 doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne was a reworked version of his 1906 dissertation under the title Friedrich Nietzsche dans la philosophie du droit et de la cit\u00e9 (\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right and the State\").  Upon his return to Greece, he began translating works of philosophy. In 1914 he met Angelos Sikelianos. Together they travelled for two years in places where Greek Orthodox Christian culture flourished, largely influenced by the enthusiastic nationalism of Sikelianos.\nKazantzakis married Galatea Alexiou in 1911; they divorced in 1926. He married Eleni Samiou in 1945. Between 1922 and his death in 1957, he sojourned in Paris and Berlin (from 1922 to 1924), Italy, Russia (in 1925), Spain (in 1932), and then later in Cyprus, Aegina, Egypt, Mount Sinai, Czechoslovakia, Nice (he later bought a villa in nearby Antibes, in the Old Town section near the famed seawall), China, and Japan.\nWhile in Berlin, where the political situation was explosive, Kazantzakis discovered communism and became an admirer of Vladimir Lenin. He never became a committed communist, but visited the Soviet Union and stayed with the Left Opposition politician and writer Victor Serge. He witnessed the rise of Joseph Stalin, and became disillusioned with Soviet-style communism. Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology.\nAs a journalist in 1926 he got interviews from Miguel Primo de Rivera and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.\nThe 50th anniversary of the death of Nikos Kazantzakis was selected as main motif for a high-value euro collectors' coin; the \u20ac10 Greek Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin, minted in 2007. His image is on the obverse of the coin, while the reverse carries the National Emblem of Greece with his signature.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nDuring WWII he was in Athens and translated the Iliad, together with the philologist Ioannis Kakridis. In 1945, he became the leader of a small party on the non-communist left, and entered the Greek government as Minister without Portfolio. He resigned this post the following year. In 1946, The Society of Greek Writers recommended that Kazantzakis and Angelos Sikelianos be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1957, he lost the Prize to Albert Camus by one vote. Camus later said that Kazantzakis deserved the honour \"a hundred times more\" than himself. In total Kazantzakis was nominated in nine different years. Late in 1957, even though suffering from leukemia, he set out on one last trip to China and Japan. Falling ill on his return flight, he was transferred to Freiburg, Germany, where he died. He is buried on the wall surrounding the city of Heraklion near the Chania Gate, looking out over the mountains and sea of Crete. His epitaph reads \"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\" (\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1. \u0394\u03b5 \u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1. \u0395\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2.)\n\n\n== Literary work ==\nKazantzakis' first published work was the 1906 narrative, Serpent and Lily (\u038c\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf), which he signed with the pen name Karma Nirvami. In 1907 Kazantzakis went to Paris for his graduate studies and was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Henry Bergson, primarily the idea that a true understanding of the world comes from the combination of intuition, personal experience, and rational thought. The theme of rationalism mixed with irrationality later became central to many of Kazantzakis' later stories, characters, and personal philosophies. Later, in 1909, he wrote a one-act play titled Comedy, which was filled with existential themes, predating the post-World War II existentialist movement in Europe spearheaded by writers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus. After completing his studies in Paris, he wrote the tragedy, \"The Master Builder\" (\u039f \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2), based on a popular Greek folkloric myth.\n\nThrough the next several decades, from the 1910s through the 1930s, Kazantzakis traveled around Greece, much of Europe, northern Africa, and to several countries in Asia. Countries he visited include: Germany, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Romania, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, among others. These journeys put Kazantzakis in contact with different philosophies, ideologies, lifestyles, and people, all of which influenced him and his writings. Kazantzakis would often write about his influences in letters to friends, citing Sigmund Freud, the philosophy of Nietzsche, Buddhist theology, and communist ideology and major influences. While he continued to travel later in life, the bulk of his travel writing came from this time period.\nKazantzakis began writing The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel in 1924, and completed it in 1938 after fourteen years of writing and revision. The poem follows the hero of Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus, as he undertakes a final journey after the end of the original poem. Following the structure of Homer's Odyssey, it is divided into 24 rhapsodies and consists of 33,333 lines. While Kazantzakis felt this poem held his cumulative wisdom and experience, and that it was his greatest literary experience, critics were split, \"some praised it as an unprecedented epic, [while] many simply viewed it as a hybristic act,\" with many scholars still being split to this day. A common criticism of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel was aimed at Kazantzakis' over-reliance on flowery and metaphorical verse, a criticism that is also aimed at his works of fiction.Many of Kazantzakis' most famous novels were published between 1940 and 1961, including Zorba the Greek (1946), Christ Recrucified (1948), Captain Michalis (1953), The Last Temptation of Christ (1955), and Report to Greco (1961).\nScholar Peter Bein argues that each story explores different aspects of post-World War II Greek culture such as religion, nationalism, political beliefs, the Greek Civil War, gender roles, immigration, and general cultural practices and beliefs. These works also explore what Kazantzakis believed to be the unique physical and spiritual location of Greece, a nation that belongs to neither the East nor the West, an idea he put forth in many of his letters to friends. As the scholar Peter Bein argued, \"Kazantzakis viewed Greece's special mission as the reconciliation of Eastern instinct with Western reason,\" echoing the Bergsonian themes that balance logic against emotion found in many of Kazantzakis' novels.\nTwo of these works of fiction, Zorba the Greek and The Last Temptation of Christ had major motion picture adaptations in 1964 and 1988 respectively.\n\n\n== Language and use of Demotic Greek ==\nDuring the time when Kazantzakis was writing his novels, poems, and plays, the majority of \"serious\" Greek artistic work was written in Katharevousa, a \"pure\" form of the Greek language that was created to bridge Ancient Greek with Modern, Demotic Greek, and to \"purify\" Demotic Greek. The use of Demotic, among writers, gradually started to gain the upper hand only in the turn of the 20th century, under the influence of the New Athenian School (or Palamian).\nIn his letters to friends and correspondents, Kazantzakis wrote that he chose to write in Demotic Greek to capture the spirit of the people, and to make his writing resonate with the common Greek citizen. Moreover, he wanted to prove that the common spoken language of Greek was able to produce artistic, literary works. Or, in his own words, \"Why not show off all the possibilities of demotic Greek?\" Furthermore, Kazantzakis felt that it was important to record the vernacular of the everyday person, including Greek peasants, and often tried to include expressions, metaphors, and idioms he would hear while traveling throughout Greece, and incorporate them into his writing for posterity. At the time of writing, some scholars and critics panned his work because it was not written in Katharevousa, while others praised it precisely because it was written in Demotic Greek.\nSeveral critics have argued that Kazantzakis' writing was too flowery, filled with obscure metaphors, and difficult to read, despite the fact that his works were written in Demotic Greek. Kazantzakis scholar Peter Bein argues that the metaphors and language Kazantzakis used were taken directly from the peasants he encountered when traveling Greece. Bein asserts that, since Kazantzakis was trying to preserve the language of the people, he used their local metaphors and phrases to give his narrative an air of authenticity and preserve these phrases so that they were not lost.\n\n\n== Socialism ==\nThroughout his life, Kazantzakis reiterated his belief that \"only socialism as the goal and democracy as the means\" could provide an equitable solution to the \"frightfully urgent problems of the age in which we are living.\" He saw the need for socialist parties throughout the world to put aside their bickering and unite so that the program of \"socialist democracy\" could prevail not just in Greece, but throughout the civilized world. He described socialism as a social system which \"does not permit the exploitation of one person by another\" and that \"must guarantee every freedom.\"Kazantzakis was anathema to the right-wing in Greece both before and after World War II. The right waged war against his books and called him \"immoral\" and a \"Bolshevik troublemaker\" and accused him of being a \"Russian agent\". He was also distrusted by the Greek and Russian Communist parties as a \"bourgeois\" thinker. However, upon his death in 1957, he was honored by the Chinese Communist party as a \"great writer\" and \"devotee of peace.\" Following the war, he was temporarily leader of a minor Greek leftist party, while in 1945 he was, among others, a founding member of the Greek-Soviet friendship union.\n\n\n== Religious beliefs and relationship with the Greek Orthodox Church ==\nWhile Kazantzakis was deeply spiritual, he often discussed his struggle with religious faith, specifically his Greek Orthodoxy. Baptized Greek Orthodox as a child, he was fascinated by the lives of saints from a young age. As a young man he took a month long trip to Mount Athos, a major spiritual center for Greek Orthodoxy. Most critics and scholars of Kazantzakis agree that the struggle to find truth in religion and spirituality was central to a great deal of his works, and that some novels, like The Last Temptation of Christ and Christ Recrucified focus completely on questioning Christian morals and values. As he traveled Europe, he was influenced by various philosophers, cultures, and religions, like Buddhism, causing him to question his Christian beliefs. While never claiming to be an atheist, his public questioning and critique of the most fundamental Christian values put him at odds with some in the Greek Orthodox church, and many of his critics. Scholars theorize that Kazantzakis' difficult relationship with many members of the clergy, and the more religiously conservative literary critics, came from his questioning. In his book, Broken Hallelujah: Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian Theology, author Darren Middleton theorizes that, \"Where the majority of Christian writers focus on God's immutability, Jesus' deity, and our salvation through God's grace, Kazantzakis emphasized divine mutability, Jesus' humanity, and God's own redemption through our effort,\" highlighting Kazantzakis' uncommon interpretation of traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs. Many Orthodox Church clergy condemned Kazantzakis' work and a campaign was started to excommunicate him. His reply was: \"You gave me a curse, Holy fathers, I give you a blessing: may your conscience be as clear as mine and may you be as moral and religious as I\" (Greek: \"\u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1, \u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ce \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae: \u03a3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u2018\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03ae, \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u2018\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b7\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ce\"). While the excommunication was rejected by the top leadership of the Orthodox Church, it became emblematic of the persistent disapprobation from many Christian authorities for his political and religious views.\nModern scholarship tends to dismiss the idea that Kazantzakis was being sacrilegious or blasphemous with the content of his novels and beliefs. These scholars argue that, if anything, Kazantzakis was acting in accordance to a long tradition of Christians who publicly struggled with their faith, and grew a stronger and more personal connection to God through their doubt. Moreover, scholars like Darren J. N. Middleton argue that Kazantzakis' interpretation of the Christian faith predated the more modern, personalized interpretation of Christianity that has become popular in the years after Kazantzakis' death.The Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras, the leader of the Orthodox Church, declared in 1961 in Heraklion: \u201cKazantzakis is a great man and his works grace the Patriarchal library.\u201d\n\n\n== Bibliography of English translations ==\n\n\n=== Translations of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, in whole or in part ===\nThe Odyssey [Selections from], partial translation in prose by Kimon Friar, Wake 12 (1953), pp. 58\u201365.\nThe Odyssey, excerpt translated by Kimon Friar, Chicago Review 8, No. 2 (Spring/Summer 1954), pp. 12\u201318.\n\"The Return of Odysseus\", partial translation by Kimon Friar, The Atlantic Monthly 195, No. 6 (June 1955), pp. 110\u2013112.\nThe Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, a full verse-translation by Kimon Friar, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1958; London: Secker and Warburg, 1958.\n\"Death, the Ant\", from The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, Book XV, 829\u201363, translated by Kimon Friar, The Charioteer, No. 1 (Summer 1960), p. 39.\n\n\n=== Travel books ===\nSpain, translated by Amy Mims, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1963.\nJapan, China, translated by George C.

          "This is a small museum, a modern structure that strangely enough doesn't seem to be out of place in this typical Crete small village. We were only able to see the museum exhibits at a 'fast-forward' pace. If you know Kazantzakis and his work you'll be thrilled to see his own",
          "I must first of all declare that I can't be 100% objective, since this Museum is located in the village of Myrtia, the birth place of both my parents. However, whenever I have visit it with guests during our summer vacations, the feedback was more than positive... The Nikos",

          "Bit of a conflict for archaeology buffs ! but fantastic for lay people wanting to understand who the Minoans were. The archaeologist in the early 1900's rebuilt parts of the palace with concrete to show what it looked like. But it is obvious which is original and which is",
          "We had done our research and knew roughly what to expect. Firstly, some tips: Arrive early even off season. There is a free car park next to the site and was half empty at 10am. At 10am there was no queue in mid October for the Cassa, We are Univerity members and ID card",
          "Its truly a remarkable place, so old with so much history. Gets very busy and guided tours can be a problem. We just got a taxi there (Not organised tour) but everywhere there are information boards to let you know some of the history. Its the second most visited place in Crete",
          "Knossos is a nice and interesting historic place. There is many free parking for cars and bus in front of palace. There is a lot of shops and tavern in front of palace. The walk is pleasant and interesting around the great palace!We are glad that some parts of the palace are",

          "An off peak visit as early as 8am is advised as there are lots of pinch points. Even off peak there were queues to see the more popular places in the palace. I found the amount of concrete off putting, in spite of understanding how and why there was so much. Do wear decent",
          "Fab place. So interesting. However going on a tour with English tourists being the minority meant we had a lot of waiting about to hear what was next. If you can, go earlier in the morning before the coaches arrive. I think it's open from 8am",

          "This pile of rocks is mostly made up of replicas that may or may not be historically accurate. Don\u2019t waste your time. If you want to support local tourism then go to the island itself as it\u2019s a beautiful place, but if you want a more historical and engaging experience either",
          "A fascinating archaeological site, Evans did his work well to give an insight into life in Minoan times. We went late in the afternoon, to be recommended as the crowds were thinner and the heat less intensive. Well worth a visit!",
          "If you are a \u201cvisitor of palaces\u201d don\u2019t expect to see a place at Knossos. There is a series of ruins and a lot of walking on uneven surfaces. There are a few surviving friezes but this is 4000 years old so don\u2019t think of it as a Cretan Versailles. However on entering you are",
          "My husband and I visited in September which was still very hot. Although it is amazing to see how the palace might have looked most of the site was reconstructed by a British archeologist which is disappointing. However still worth going to. We also saw a beautiful peacock",
          "It's a wonderful place by itself, but I really recommend to have the guide here. We had a wonderful guide, who was passionate about the whole story and the visit was really unforgettable. In combination to the Palace of Knossos I recommend to visit Archaeological museum in",

          "Eight of us took the open bus that drops you off right in the parking lot so you don't have to walk too far. Get there early and purchase your ticket there. We decided to get their tour guide and certainly glad we did. If we didn't I would have the same reaction as the other",
          "You don\u2019t need my opinion on this historical site but I will leave you some tips. Don\u2019t buy tickets in advance the line goes quickly.

          "Very very crowded with groups standing around listening to their guides blocking the small walkways and route. Lots of rubble with small areas reconstituted to give you a feel of the place but it just didn\u2019t do it for me. Visit the museum instead as you\u2019ll get more out of it.",
          "Yes this is an important historical site. BUT. Crowded to the hilt with crocodiles of tourist bus groups blindly following their leader.Sadly the reconstruction or 'interpretation' has been undertaken in reinforced concrete which looks just plain wrong.Get a guide book first",
          "Definitely worth a visit being a live archaeological dig. Wear suitable footwear as the paths are uneven.",
          "I realize that most reviews are positive for this site but I will have to disagree. The place is super crowded with tour buses in a relatively small archeological site. I felt like a salmon swimming upstream. Most of the site is not much more than rubble and the few things that",
          "If you ask at the entrance they will tell you can enter and easily go around with a stroller. It is not completely true. Most of the rooms are not accessible. So I wouldn't recommend it to small children. Site is amazing and there is lot to discover. But you will have to use",

          "Don't get me wrong this place is worth visiting if you are in the area but in terms of archaeological importance in world wide, let alone European, significance there are more interesting and better things to see. However, the Museum of Archaeology in nearby Heraklion is well",
          "I felt like we could have done this in a lot less time. I've toured many sites in Egypt and was slightly disappointed that most of what you saw here was re-created, but necessary, as the original burned a few times (and was made largely of wood). Strongly recommend a quick (1",

          "It's a great place, with old history, very old. It's easy access, great view. Be early, before all busses will come. It gets really busy. And hard to get good photos, and to enjoy this place, when it gets crowded. So go early, and it will be great. If you like history, it's a",

          "Visited at about 2pm after the coach parties had gone and before the cruise liner guests arrived. Decided to hire a guide - best thing we could have done as a guide gives much more colour and information to the tour. Well worth it. Fascinating how the Legend of the Labyrinth",

          "A great place to visit. Very interesting. We were lucky to avoid the coach tours as I imagine it would be extremely busy in high season. 50c to use the ladies toilet ! Concessionary rates for over 65s if you produce ID. We used our driving licenses.",
          "A very nice site with some restoration to encourage your imagination as to the past greatness of the past. The site is easy to find and access. Plenty of parking if you are driving. I personally like the restoration that has been done. There is also a very beautiful view of the",
          "We were lucky to arrive in early afternoon after the crowds had cleared out which made it very easy to walk around. It was much more extensive than I thought and the restorations were done in a way to keep the history alive. Certainly makes one very humbled by their engineering",
          "This is of course a five star attraction, but just to make a point of the conservation and presentation: Four points in stead of five. The Palace of Knossos is extremely interesting and shoud not be missed. If you visit Crete and have the least chance to go to Knossos: You",
          "I came to here with a couple of friends. We thought we could google the facts and follow the map ourselves and read the plaques ourselves. But the site is large and the buildings are at least 50% rubble, therefore I recommend paying for a guide. It will give you history, fun",
          "Well worth a visit for anyone interested in Greek history. It is huge and beautiful and incredibly clever. It is just an amazing place and if you are not happy going around by yourself then there are tour guides available. We quite happily meandered for a few hrs without",
          "Amazing place if you like history.we didn't have much time but managed a good short visit of 2 hours. Best go early at opening time 0800 to avoid queues either getting tickets or getting in.also you can then avoid large tour groups. By doing this you should be able to have",
          "I am definitely a fan of Greek antiquity and this might be my 4th or 5th trip here over 40 years. It never disappoints. Each time I brought with me people who were unfamiliar with the history but left an appreciator. I always hire a licensed guide at the site and learn more each",
          "If you are a litle bit interested of a Greek history, that is a must see. You need 2-3 hours time, a botle of watter and a shield hat, And if you go in the morning, there are not so many people.",

          "Unless you\u2019re a real fan of boring archeological digs, skip this one! Much of it\u2019s reconstruction is the vision of one man & not entirely based on facts. There is very little to see & the price was 15 Euros. It took us about 30 min. to see the whole thing. Had tour guides",

          "We spent around an hour here, it was very hot, but there were quite a lot of places to rest in the shade. We were greeted at the entrance by someone offering a guided tour in English, but it was 10 Euros extra per person (including our eldest child) on top of the 15 euro entry,",
          "This has to be top of the list of you are visiting Crete. We were lucky to be part of a tour with a very informative interesting guide but there were a lot of information boards so it would be ok if you were to visit without a guide. A great deal of the artefacts have been moved",
          "Very impressive place. Make sure to go early or late. We have been visiting at 5pm in high season and it was nearly empty. Private guides are very expensive and (my view) not really needed.",
          "The premier historical site on Crete - particularly if you have memories of the Minotaur legend. Atmospheric location and although the \u2018reconstructions\u2019 are controversial they do give a good sense to the site. Take plenty of water and a hat, high sun exposure.",
          "The Minoan ruins at this site were spectacular. We did not get to go to the museum where the real art was placed, but the replicas in place here fueled the imagination of what life was like. Worth the stop. Comfortable shoes a must.",
          "Went to Knossos at the end of the day, when it was less hot. Not too much people, and it's a good site to visit. Lot of things to see, price is fair. Some pieces were rebuilt and not everyone like that, but it's better to see a palace in \"3 dimensions\" with partial walls, than",
          "Absolutely breath taking. A must for the ones that love ancient history and architecture. Very well preserved and valued.",
          "When entering we were approached by one of the touts, for a tour in your own language. Although she did not go in great detail, it was worth it to get an explanation of the site. Official archeologists claim this to be the disneyland of archeology. Well, for us tourists it makes",
          "Went to the palace with my family with an interest in history and looking forward to a nice afternoon out. The palace itself is very interesting and well preserved considering how old it is! \u20ac15 is a bit steep but not too unreasonable - there is student discount which brings",
          "Amazing to see! I wish I did not use guided tour because it took a lot of time to go around in a heat and lines were long. Best to read about it beforehand and do it yourself - I recommend going super early or late if you are visiting in the summer. Not for older people or",
          "There is so much history in Crete, and this is part of it. Definately worth a visit. \u20ac15 each to enter (free for under 18s). There is plenty of boards around with information about the palace and its history. You can pay for a guided tour but these looked like big groups. We",

          "Incredible history. Well kept with all it's glory. Lots of people with a long line at the entrance. But it didn't take that long. Feel the history while walking around at this amazing site. Ps, the toilets were the absolute cleanest I ever seen a public bathroom.",
          "When I did my first visit to the Palace of Knossos, 30 years ago, there weren't so much tourists, you'd go there anytime you want and you'd easily access to each corner and room without restrictions, today is a nightmare, this time I start my visit at 8:30 in the morning,",
          "Good place to visit, if history and ancient stories are of interest to you. It's surrounded by trees, therefore it's easy to find a shadow during the heat, you can go also in a hot day.",

          "An educational trip for the family! Greece is rich in history and Knossos is just one of them. Withe the sight of all the relics and the excavation, one would have a feel and idea of how civilization started in Greece. Amazing place to visit!",

          "Booked this visit through Tui. before we travelled Sad to say we found the whole visit really disappointing there isn't a great deal to see in terms of visual aspects. you tend to have to use a great deal of imagining how the palace looked. Our guide was outstanding and spoke",
          "Booked the trip to the palace of Knossos through a travel company in the resort. Came with a tablet where we could immerse ourselves in images of what the palace would have been like. To be honest that was a waste of time & much preferred looking at the ruins. Our tour was in",
          "We visited the museum in Heraklion first, so were able to appreciate where the artefacts had come from. It is best to visit early in the day due to the heat. The winds helped us to appreciate why it had been built there. Views are fantastic. Also really enjoyed the fresh juices",
          "Hi, i visit the palace of Knossos during my vacation in August and this was terrible for children and my wife... Pros: 1. Combined ticket with Archiological Museum (another location in Herclion). 2. Impressive architecture - mainly remained few buildings and 3 colums. Cons: 1.",
          "Nice to see free parking and direct bus (no. 2) from the city. Really worthwhile to obtain the services of a guard, either \u20ac10 for group or \u20ac80 for own personal tour. These charges are in addition to entry fee of \u20ac15. The site is enormous but has many areas of shade. Personal",
          "We really enjoyed the guided tour of the palace. Our guide was very informative and we learned a lot. Even our reluctant young teenagers enjoyed the tour and were interested in the information provided by the tour guide. We went in the afternoon and the crowds were minimal.",
          "If you are looking for old ruins don't go here. Much has been rebuilt with very brightly coloured frescoes which look too new. Concrete features heavily as well but if you can see beyond this facade and picture what it might have looked like originally, you can have a good time",
          "We had no problem with queues - arriving at 5pm on a Friday and our two offspring got in for free with their student ID cards. Our entrance was \u20ac15 each. However, despite the quick entry we were underwhelmed by the site - it has an odd feel to it with a mix of original",
          "This site is such a well preserved site and the walk around and getting up close and personal to it is amazing. It is a huge outdoor site and was steaming hot so make sure you get there early before all the large buses come in. I had no queue early at the ticket office but",

          "This place is packed 24/7 so I recommend getting there early to beat the cruise line crowds. It\u2019s also hot during Summer (scorching hot) and rocky and dusty and hot. So my recommendation is to wear comfortable shoes like sneakers, take water, pack on sunscreen and wear a hat.",

          "In retrospect it would be best to see Phaisos first which is quite atmospheric. Then here at Knossos which is ok and then go for the finale to the archeological museum in Heraklion. The museum is so clearly the big attraction full of artefacts and so well described Knossos is",
          "I know a lot of people bemoan the fact some of the site has been reconstructed to give the visitors a better idea of what this palace site would have felt like, but for me I liked that this had been done as it added to the feel of the place. After all there are countless other",

          "Decided not to visit the site by coach and made our own way by car. Plenty of parking available in the palace car park and at the open air restaurant nearby(good food served). We do like looking around historical sites but have to say that the palace is overrated and overpriced.",

          "A tourist spot par excellence. This special and historical so important place is crowded and loud. The huge complex is buried under thousand of tourists.",
          "I would only suggest going here if you have nothing better to do. 15 euros (8 for 65+) so quite expensive, and in my opinion not worth it. No information leaflet, guidebook or audio guide - just information boards that at times you had to queue up to read. Frankly not that",
          "As many suggested, we went to the museum first before touring the archeological site. The museum truly impressed us with the grandeur of the Minoan civilization. You will be glad you saw and read about the artifacts found at the site first, because it makes touring Knossos so",
          "If you know the story and the history then you can get around the site yourself in about 90 minutes but if you don't, then it's best to take a guide. The guide station is at the entrance before the ticket sales which is a bit odd, so you should sort this out before you buy the",
          "Having been to Rome & Sorrento recently both of which have more than their fair share of fantastic archeological sites, The Palace of Knossos is left wanting. It seems like the restoration isn\u2019t being done very carefully. Having said that I\u2019m no archeology boffin so maybe I\u2019m",
          "I'll be the first to admit that I'm not really interested in history of these archaeological sites but enjoy having a look round and seeing how things were built and the way they lived, at the major sites information is there to tell you a little about it. We arrived here",
          "I like this place. Knossos is exciting and impressive in its size. It's the second time we visited the site, first time on a guided tour this time on our own, and how much more one gets from an 'unguided' tour, just the book in one hand and the water in the other. One can really",
          "It certainly was an interesting place to visit, one which I\u2019ve been very interested in for a long time, however when you go and get a guide, check them out first. We had a very blunt and rude guide who for unknown reasons was just so short and rude to me. Others in our group",

          "It\u2019s hard to say just how accurate is this representation of the actual palace. But the archaeologist used the materials on site and his experiences to refabricate the area. Pretty interesting if you ask me.",
          "Overcrowded. Guides try to intercept you before you can walk to the ticket office. The woman at the ticket office was super unfriendly. We had official transcripts that we were all students, and only one friend of us had the student card with her. The woman only allowed the free",

          "We had an excellent guide who knew the site well, she gave us a real insight into the minoan civilization through her tour and talk. Well worth the entry price. We had a joint Knossos/Archeology museum ticket which was excellent value. Sadly the toilet facilities were inadequate",
          "As our guide told us, people here had a sewage system and air conditioned about 4000 years ago - what more could you say about it. Even if it was extremely warm, the visit is a refreshing one as there are some areas with shadow and with its own ventilation system.",
          "An iconic place to visit if you are in Crete. We took a 1 hour and 30 min visit with an italian guide than explained all about the palace, the way they lived and worked. Suggest to take a licensed guide for the visit. We paid 16 eur for 1 ticket that included the museum in",

          "Given it is 3,500-4,000 years old the stone structures are impressive. Reconstruction is in progress and authentic walls and some interpretation is evident. Archeological students and historical buffs will be keen to imagine how humans live so long ago. In terms of",
          "Got here but should have realised that was going to be busy as a cruise ship in port. Large que when we got here, but walked straight through with guide we took on , which I would recommend as learn a lot more about the place than reading the boards scattered all over the place.",

Only 3 of us in the end so jumped to the front of tickets queue (8\u20ac each) and skipped the toilet queue too as the guides have",
          "Firstly either get there for opening time or after 2pm as it is heaving between 10:39am & 2pm. The site will give you hours of interest but you do need to sit and read the guide every so often to appreciate what you are seeing. As much as I hate being corralled some directional",

          "This was a lovely little trip to see the ruins I would suggest getting a tour guide they are hovering outside and will ask you if you are interested in a guide for a small fee it makes the tour round much more interesting and very informative to the back story of the ruins.",
          "Had a great time looking around the palace, there are sign posts around the area which give a description of the different buildings in English. For more information it would be better to have a guide, we didn\u2019t do this as the guides were expensive on the day but we found the",
          "We did this place ourselves instead of a guided tour which if I'm honest looked very tiring and slow.....the place has a lot of history as you would expect....I would say the a maximum of 2 hours will see you round the palace.....good and drinks are available. I would suggest",

          "Quite a big area, but there aren't the columns and statues that you find at other similar sites. Anything that is interesting is a recreation done in the 20s. We decided to travel independently from Malia. It cost us around 28 euros in bus fares and entry tickets. The organised",

They don\u2019t even tell you this when you go in but they",
          "We went on this tour arranged by Klados travel and led by an archaeologist. He brought us around the palace of Knossos explaining in a very interesting way the layout and history of the site. After lunch he brought us around the museum in Heraklion and explained the exhibitions.",
          "A must see monument of Minoan civilization. Better to visit early in the morning to avoid the high temperatures in July and August.",
          "A must see to contextualize all the objects in the Archeological Museum. Both experiences are crucial to one another. The reconstructions are troubling in not knowing what is original and what is reconstructed but Knossos gives the over all understanding of the breadth and depth",

          "We booked a guided tour to The Palace of Knossos as it was recommended by our TUI rep 'you don't visit Crete without visiting Knossos'. Our guide had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Cretan and tried her best to make the tip interesting and fun. This place is of course",
          "The most boring trip ever. Location is almost in town, not spectacular, crowded. A lot of small closed spaces with stone walls. Is common sense that the Minotaur myth appeared here. And is so expensive..15 euros not well spent..Balos Lagoon is for 1 euro They sell also tickets",
          "Really interesting, well laid-out. There are buses that stop outside, although we had a hire car (it's well-signposted and easy to find). There's a free car park next to it, and a nice, sensibly-priced cafeteria inside. Definitely take water, sunscreen and a hat. Even the",
          "This Palace is a must visit place if you go to Crete.When you are inside you need to stand still, look all around and take it all in, because if you are on a \"tour\" the guide will be informative but they will rush you on. You must have a decent footwear or else end up with sore",
          "This was an amazing day out. Firstly visiting the Palace then the museum in Heraklion where we saw such well preserved artefacts many of which dated from 1400 ad and older. Definitely worth a visit. You will not be disappointed!",
          "Our tour guide was not ideal and didn\u2019t teach us much in way of information. Simply explaining oh here is the drainage system and some nice pictures. Don\u2019t understand why we wasn\u2019t allowed around on our own.",
          "The site ofcourse is interesting and important, but the fee was far too expensive just to walk around. If you are not too familiar with the history make sure to take a guided tour so you understand where you are.. we didn\u2019t and we\u2019re not too happy.",
          "A full ticket is 15\u20ac. The tickets were supposed to be free for students, however, an ISIC card and foreign high school cards were not accepted. Seeing as Knossos and the Minoan culture is the cradle of European civilization, I don't see why tickets are necessary in the first",
          "The Palace of Knossos is mostly in ruins, so you either have someone explaining the amazing history behind it, or the place is not worth visiting. I was amazed with what I learned about the minoan civilization with my guided tour!",

          "This was not the best ruins visit I have ever been to and it was quite pricey (15 euros each, student rate is half but they don't accept international student cards so bring your uni card). It can be quite hot up there, so don't go on the hottest day! It was packed with tourists",
          "Famously found by an English archaeologist (Evans), early in the 20th century, he attempted to reconstruct parts of the site. Purists, are horrified, but I felt it enhanced the site. A worthy visit.",

          "Been a few times but this was definitely the best. Ear pods and an iPad made the whole experience a lot more interesting and interactive. I love the fact that they are discovering new things all of the time. Theory is that there is another palace under the current one. Must go",
          "Very disappointed with Knossos. It has been restored even more than when we last visited it 40 years ago. Crowds of tourists and very many tour groups blocking the views.",
          "What a load of rubbish , modern interpretations of what Arthur Evans from Oxford University at the turn of the century thought that it should like and parts of it have been rebuilt to reflect his vision. Site information stated \u20ac6 but actually cost \u20ac15. Don't waste money and",

          "Suggest that you visit the museum first before going to the site. So refreshing to visit the museum that houses the treasures found here and that were created by the people from the place. I salute Crete for so successfully resisting any attempts to export its artefacts. This",
          "Fascinating site but the subject of some clumsy renovations and speculation about how the palace was used. Go early-it was heaving by the time we left. We would very much recommend getting a guide other wise as someone put it, it's just a bunch of old ruins. We would also",
          "We joined a tour group for this historic site and apparently so did most of Crete at the same time. We were hustled through, the guide had to yell to be heard above other guides, a strange long que had to be formed to quickly take a picture of a throne replica and even more",

          "This place broke my heart. \u20ac15 each to enter (\u20ac0.50 if you wanna dry your hands in the toilet!) and the entire palace is paved over in concrete by Arthur Evans. Very little of the palace is preserved in its original form. The information plaques give you no history on the site,",
          "Incredible place to visit steeped in history and mythology. Interesting take from Mr Evans the archaeologist in rebuilding in his belief what the palace once looked like. Would recommend a visit.",
          "Was here exactly 40 years ago but well worth second visit, although just a bit busier. Great to see so much remaining but visit to museum in Heraklion is \u2018a must\u2019 !",
          "I wondered why our cab driver was confused why we were asking to go to the palace. Once we entered I completely understood. There is nothing but rubble here and they have made no attempt at making it interesting or renovated. All of the signs provided info about the",
          "I was most disappointed with the site. Although there are many reasons why it is not as well preserved as 2000BC sites in Egypt the 'restoration' by Arthur Evans in my view ruins the place. Loads of concrete and artificial ruins and much down to his imagination. Very little",
          "18 euros is steep, herded around sheep. The ruins will not live long in my memory. Lack of history information because they only really want guided tours.",
          "This is the second most unpleasant tourist experience of my life - the worst being the Sistine Chapel. The site was absolutely overwhelmed with people. Maybe if you go in the afternoon it might be quiter but we arrived at about 10.00 to join a car park containing huge numbers of",

          "Historical site with lots to see, a must when in Heraklion! Interesting place - lots of history, people who enjoy mythology will appreciate this.",
          "Quite impressive as to how much can be seen and walked around/in/over at this location. Great for history & archeological buffs.",
          "The palast is very nicely kept and one should take a written or a tour guide to go through because it is not really self-explaining. The parking spot was for April already to small - which might be due to the fact that we arrived at 12:00 o'clock. But overall a very nice place",
          "I hadn\u2019t read much about Knossos but I knew it was an important visit to make. It\u2019s fascinating to see the extent of the palace and settlement dating back more than 4,000 years but I was much more interested in the recent history of the excavation work and then in my view the",

          "Took organised tour and was delighted with the technology which made the experience so amazing. We were given \u201cwhispers \u201c to hear every word from the guide.

          "The site is large and impressive but unless you go with a guide it will be boring. For a guide you can pre book something ahead of time or drop in and get a guide at the gate. However if you get a guide at the gate the cost is $100 euros. If you want to wait for more people to",
          "Very interesting & easy to explore/walk through. There are several plaques describing where you are, and well preserved drawings on some of the walls. Amazing archeological discovery!",
          "Worth a visit if you are interested in classical history. We know relatively little about the Minoans and that knowledge is being reassessed. We had a guide who gave us a feminist interpretation which was very different from the one from a previous trip. Its worth reading about",

          "The palace was built about 1,650\u20131,450 BC and had about 1,300 rooms. It is mostly ruins. It was interesting to see and imagine how life was lived in those times.",
          "We arrived early and beat the crowds and the heat. Joined with another family for a private tour guide at the entrance which worked out to be a reasonable price per head and well worth it. If you are interested in a lovely, good value, family run Cretan taverna a short drive",
          "This could and should be a fantastic site of preserved history. However it has been completely ruined. Walking around and reading the plaques you soon learn that a professor from Oxford in the 1920s and 30s decided that instead of just excavating and preserving the ruins, he",
          "Great site with well preserved ruins. Many of the frescoes have been removed to the museum. A guide will run about 10 EURO each but is worth it to get a sense of the story behind the ruins. Visit the museum after the site to get a fuller understanding of the civilization.",
          "I read loads of stuff saying get there early n low season but chose to ignore them at my peril - if travelling independently I would recommend arriving before 9-45 am. If you manage then you can read the information boards before the hoards of buses arrrive which is great Also",
          "Really interesting but definitely recommend a guided tour. Only \u20ac10 per person and really adds to the experience. Our guide (Maria) was great, friendly and engaging. Personally I appreciate Sir Arthur Evans' reconstructions as it really helps to picture and understand the",
          "It was so-so - only ruins to be seen and would not worry about getting a guide. Save your \u20ac10 as you can easily walk around at your own pace. No doubt our guide was knowledgeable about the history but delivery wasn\u2019t good due to her limited command of English. After having",

          "This is a spectacular site, nestled among the mountains. Partial reconstructions from the early 20th century add to the interest - in part because they give a sense of how grand the palace must have been, and in part because of the questions raised around the accuracy of modern",
          "We had been traveling for close to a month and I\u2019ve been to Rome and Malta and several other historical sites, but this was by far our favorite. While purists may say that the reconstructions were improper archaeology and should not have been done... but I found it helpful, it",

          "Absolutely astonishing place. Don't expect to spend less than 3 hours there. They are very honest about Arthur Evans's reconstructions and interpretations, but that takes nothing away from the impact of the sophistication of the layout and what went on there. Then tie it in with",
          "Despite the ethnocentric interference of Evans, the impressive aspects of the Minoan civilization emerge from this impressive site. Worth a trip to understand what influenced the ancient Greeks who came along about 1800 years after the Minoans",

        "wiki": "The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age Aegean civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, flourishing from c. 3000 BC to c. 1450 BC until a late period of decline, finally ending around 1100 BC. It represents the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive building complexes, tools, artwork, writing systems, and a massive network of trade. The civilization was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century through the work of British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. The name \"Minoan\" derives from the mythical King Minos and was coined by Evans, who identified the site at Knossos with the labyrinth and the Minotaur. The Minoan civilization has been described as the earliest of its kind in Europe, and historian Will Durant called the Minoans \"the first link in the European chain\".The Minoan civilization is particularly notable for its large and elaborate palaces up to four stories high, featuring elaborate plumbing systems and decorated with frescoes. The most notable Minoan palace is that of Knossos, followed by that of Phaistos. The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete, Aegean, and Mediterranean settlements, particularly the Near East. Through their traders and artists, the Minoans' cultural influence reached beyond Crete to the Cyclades, the Old Kingdom of Egypt, copper-bearing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia. Some of the best Minoan art is preserved in the city of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini, which was destroyed by the Minoan eruption.\nThe Minoans primarily wrote in the  Linear A and also in  Cretan hieroglyphs, encoding a language hypothetically labelled Minoan. The reasons for the slow decline of the Minoan civilization, beginning around 1550 BC, are unclear; theories include Mycenaean  invasions from mainland Greece and the major volcanic eruption of Santorini.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe term \"Minoan\" refers to the mythical King Minos of Knossos. Its origin is debated, but it is commonly attributed to archeologist Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941). Minos was associated in Greek mythology with the labyrinth.\nHowever, Karl Hoeck had already used the title Das Minoische Kreta in 1825 for volume two of his Kreta; this appears to be the first known use of the word \"Minoan\" to mean \"ancient Cretan\".\nEvans probably read Hoeck's book, and continued using the term in his writings and findings: \"To this early civilization of Crete as a whole I have proposed\u2014and the suggestion has been generally adopted by the archaeologists of this and other countries\u2014to apply the name 'Minoan'.\" Evans said that he applied it, not invented it.\nHoeck, with no idea that the archaeological Crete had existed, had in mind the Crete of mythology. Although Evans' 1931 claim that the term was \"unminted\" before he used it was called a \"brazen suggestion\" by Karadimas and Momigliano, he coined its archaeological meaning.\n\n\n== Chronology and history ==\n\nInstead of dating the Minoan period, archaeologists use two systems of relative chronology. The first, created by Evans and modified by later archaeologists, is based on pottery styles and imported Egyptian artifacts (which can be correlated with the Egyptian chronology). Evans' system divides the Minoan period into three major eras: early (EM), middle (MM) and late (LM). These eras are subdivided\u2014for example, Early Minoan I, II and III (EMI, EMII, EMIII).\nAnother dating system, proposed by Greek archaeologist Nikolaos Platon, is based on the development of architectural complexes known as \"palaces\" at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia and Zakros. Platon divides the Minoan period into pre-, proto-, neo- and post-palatial sub-periods. The relationship between the systems in the table includes approximate calendar dates from Warren and Hankey (1989).\nThe Minoan eruption of Thera occurred during a mature phase of the LM IA period. Efforts to establish the volcanic eruption's date have been controversial. Radiocarbon dating has indicated a date in the late 17th century BC; this conflicts with estimates by archaeologists, who synchronize the eruption with conventional Egyptian chronology for a date of 1525\u20131500 BC. Tree-ring dating using the patterns of carbon-14 captured in the tree rings from Gordion and bristlecone pines in North America indicate an eruption date around 1560 BC.\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nAlthough stone-tool evidence suggests that hominins may have reached Crete as early as 130,000 years ago, evidence for the first anatomically-modern human presence dates to 10,000\u201312,000 YBP. The oldest evidence of modern human habitation on Crete is pre-ceramic Neolithic farming-community remains which date to about 7000 BC. A comparative study of DNA haplogroups of modern Cretan men showed that a male founder group, from Anatolia or the Levant, is shared with the Greeks. The Neolithic population lived in open villages. Fishermen's huts were found on the shores, and the fertile Messara Plain was used for agriculture.\n\n\n==== Early Minoan ====\nThe Early Bronze Age (3500 to 2100 BC) has been described as indicating a \"promise of greatness\" in light of later developments on the island. The Bronze Age began on Crete around 3200 BC. In the late third millennium BC, several locations on the island developed into centers of commerce and handiwork, enabling the upper classes to exercise leadership and expand their influence. It is likely that the original hierarchies of the local elites were replaced by monarchies, a precondition for the palaces.\n\n\n==== Middle Minoan ====\nAt the end of the MMII period (1700 BC) there was a large disturbance on Crete\u2014probably an earthquake, but possibly an invasion from Anatolia. The palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia and Kato Zakros were destroyed.\nAt the beginning of the neopalatial period the population increased again, the palaces were rebuilt on a larger scale and new settlements were built across the island. This period (the 17th and 16th centuries BC, MM III-Neopalatial) was the apex of Minoan civilization. After around 1700 BC, material culture on the Greek mainland reached a new high due to Minoan influence.\n\n\n==== Late Minoan ====\nAnother natural catastrophe occurred around 1600 BC, possibly an eruption of the Thera volcano. The Minoans rebuilt the palaces with several major differences in function.Around 1450 BC, Minoan culture reached a turning point due to a natural disaster (possibly an earthquake). Although another eruption of the Thera volcano has been linked to this downfall, its dating and implications are disputed. Several important palaces, in locations such as Malia, Tylissos, Phaistos and Hagia Triada, and the living quarters of Knossos were destroyed. The palace in Knossos seems to have remained largely intact, resulting in its dynasty's ability to spread its influence over large parts of Crete until it was overrun by the Mycenaean Greeks.After about a century of partial recovery, most Cretan cities and palaces declined during the 13th century BC (LHIIIB-LMIIIB). The last Linear A archives date to LMIIIA, contemporary with LHIIIA. Knossos remained an administrative center until 1200 BC. The last Minoan site was the defensive mountain site of Karfi, a refuge which had vestiges of Minoan civilization nearly into the Iron Age.\n\n\n==== Foreign influence ====\nThe influence of Minoan civilization is seen in Minoan handicrafts on the Greek mainland. The shaft tombs of Mycenae had several Cretan imports (such as a bull's-head rhyton), which suggests a prominent role for Minoan symbolism. Connections between Egypt and Crete are prominent; Minoan ceramics are found in Egyptian cities, and the Minoans imported items (particularly papyrus) and architectural and artistic ideas from Egypt. Egyptian hieroglyphs might even have been models for the Cretan hieroglyphs, from which the Linear A and Linear B writing systems developed. Archaeologist Hermann Bengtson has also found a Minoan influence in Canaanite artifacts.\nMinoan palace sites were occupied by the Mycenaeans around 1420\u20131375 BC. Mycenaean Greek, a form of ancient Greek, was written in Linear B, which was an adaptation of Linear A. The Mycenaeans tended to adapt (rather than supplant) Minoan culture, religion and art, continuing the Minoan economic system and bureaucracy.During LMIIIA (1400\u20131350 BC), k-f-t-w was listed as one of the \"Secret Lands of the North of Asia\" at the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III. Also mentioned are Cretan cities such as Amnisos, Phaistos, Kydonia and Knossos and toponyms reconstructed as in the Cyclades or the Greek mainland. If the values of these Egyptian names are accurate, the Pharaoh did not value LMIII Knossos more than other states in the region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCrete is a mountainous island with natural harbors. There are signs of earthquake damage at many Minoan sites, and clear signs of land uplifting and submersion of coastal sites due to tectonic processes along its coast.According to Homer, Crete had 90 cities. Judging by the palace sites, the island was probably divided into at least eight political units at the height of the Minoan period. The vast majority of Minoan sites are found in central and eastern Crete, with few in the western part of the island. There appears to be four major palaces on the island: Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros. The north is thought to have been governed from Knossos, the south from Phaistos, the central-eastern region from Malia, the eastern tip from Kato Zakros. Smaller palaces have been found elsewhere on the island.\n\n\n=== Major settlements ===\nKnossos \u2013 the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete. Knossos had an estimated population of 1,300 to 2,000 in 2500 BC, 18,000 in 2000 BC, 20,000 to 100,000 in 1600 BC and 30,000 in 1360 BC.\nPhaistos \u2013 the second-largest palatial building on the island, excavated by the Italian school shortly after Knossos\nMalia \u2013 the subject of French excavations, a palatial center which provides a look into the proto-palatial period\nKato Zakros \u2013 sea-side palatial site excavated by Greek archaeologists in the far east of the island, also known as \"Zakro\" in archaeological literature\nGalatas \u2013 confirmed as a palatial site during the early 1990s\nAgia Triada \u2013 administrative center near Phaistos which has yielded the largest number of Linear A tablets.\nGournia \u2013 town site excavated in the first quarter of the 20th century\nPyrgos \u2013 early Minoan site in southern Crete\nVasiliki \u2013 early eastern Minoan site which gives its name to distinctive ceramic ware\nFournou Korfi \u2013 southern site\nPseira \u2013 island town with ritual sites\nMount Juktas \u2013 the greatest Minoan peak sanctuary, associated with the palace of Knossos\nArkalochori \u2013 site of the Arkalochori Axe\nKarfi \u2013 refuge site, one of the last Minoan sites\nAkrotiri \u2013 settlement on the island of Santorini (Thera), near the site of the Thera Eruption\nZominthos \u2013 mountainous city in the northern foothills of Mount Ida\n\n\n=== Beyond Crete ===\n\nThe Minoans were traders, and their cultural contacts reached the Old Kingdom of Egypt, copper-containing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia. In late 2009 Minoan-style frescoes and other artifacts were discovered during excavations of the Canaanite palace at Tel Kabri, Israel, leading archaeologists to conclude that the Minoan influence was the strongest on the Canaanite city-state. These are the only Minoan artifacts which have been found in Israel.Minoan techniques and ceramic styles had varying degrees of influence on Helladic Greece. Along with Santorini, Minoan settlements are found at Kastri, Kythera, an island near the Greek mainland influenced by the Minoans from the mid-third millennium BC (EMII) to its Mycenaean occupation in the 13th century. Minoan strata replaced a mainland-derived early Bronze Age culture, the earliest Minoan settlement outside Crete.The Cyclades were in the Minoan cultural orbit and, closer to Crete, the islands of Karpathos, Saria and Kasos also contained middle-Bronze Age (MMI-II) Minoan colonies or settlements of Minoan traders. Most were abandoned in LMI, but Karpathos recovered and continued its Minoan culture until the end of the Bronze Age. Other supposed Minoan colonies, such as that hypothesized by Adolf Furtw\u00e4ngler on Aegina, were later dismissed by scholars. However, there was a Minoan colony at Ialysos on Rhodes.\n\nMinoan cultural influence indicates an orbit extending through the Cyclades to Egypt and Cyprus. Fifteenth-century BC paintings in Thebes, Egypt depict Minoan-appearing individuals bearing gifts. Inscriptions describing them as coming from keftiu (\"islands in the middle of the sea\") may refer to gift-bringing merchants or officials from Crete.Some locations on Crete indicate that the Minoans were an \"outward-looking\" society. The neo-palatial site of Kato Zakros is located within 100 meters of the modern shoreline in a bay. Its large number of workshops and wealth of site materials indicate a possible entrep\u00f4t for trade. Such activities are seen in artistic representations of the sea, including the \"Flotilla\" fresco in room five of the West House at Akrotiri.\n\n\n== Agriculture and cuisine ==\n\nThe Minoans raised cattle, sheep, pigs and goats, and grew wheat, barley, vetch and chickpeas. They also cultivated grapes, figs and olives, grew poppies for seed and perhaps opium. The Minoans also domesticated bees.Vegetables, including lettuce, celery, asparagus and carrots, grew wild on Crete. Pear, quince, and olive trees were also native. Date palm trees and cats (for hunting) were imported from Egypt. The Minoans adopted pomegranates from the Near East, but not lemons and oranges.\nThey may have practiced polyculture, and their varied, healthy diet resulted in a population increase. Polyculture theoretically maintains soil fertility and protects against losses due to crop failure. Linear B tablets indicate the importance of orchards (figs, olives and grapes) in processing crops for \"secondary products\". Olive oil in Cretan or Mediterranean cuisine is comparable to butter in northern European cuisine. The process of fermenting wine from grapes was probably a factor of the \"Palace\" economies; wine would have been a trade commodity and an item of domestic consumption. Farmers used wooden plows, bound with leather to wooden handles and pulled by pairs of donkeys or oxen.\nSeafood was also important in Cretan cuisine. The prevalence of edible molluscs in site material and artistic representations of marine fish and animals (including the distinctive LM IIIC \"Octopus\" stirrup jar), indicate appreciation and occasional use of fish by the economy. However, scholars believe that these resources were not as significant as grain, olives and animal produce. \"Fishing was one of the major activities...but there is as yet no evidence for the way in which they organized their fishing.\" An intensification of agricultural activity is indicated by the construction of terraces and dams at Pseira in the Late Minoan period.\nCretan cuisine included wild game: Cretans ate wild deer, wild boar and meat from livestock. Wild game is now extinct on Crete. A matter of controversy is whereas Minoans made use of the indigenous Cretan megafauna, which are typically thought to have been extinct considerably earlier at 10,000 BC. This is in part due to the presence of dwarf elephants in contemporary Egyptian art.Not all plants and flora were purely functional, and arts depict scenes of lily-gathering in green spaces. The fresco known as the Sacred Grove at Knossos depicts women facing left, flanked by trees. Some scholars have suggested that it is a harvest festival or ceremony to honor the fertility of the soil. Artistic depictions of farming scenes also appear on the Second Palace Period \"Harvester Vase\" (an egg-shaped rhyton) on which 27 men led by another carry hoes. This demonstrates the importance of farming as an artistic motif.\nThe discovery of storage areas in the palace compounds has prompted debate. At the second \"palace\" at Phaistos, rooms on the west side of the structure have been identified as a storage area. Jars, jugs and vessels have been recovered in the area, indicating the complex's possible role as a re-distribution center for agricultural produce. At larger sites such as Knossos, there is evidence of craft specialization (workshops). The palace at Kato Zakro indicates that workshops were integrated into palace structure. The Minoan palatial system may have developed through economic intensification, where an agricultural surplus could support a population of administrators, craftsmen and religious practitioners. The number of sleeping rooms in the palaces indicates that they could have supported a sizable population which was removed from manual labor.\n\n\n=== Tools ===\nTools, originally made of wood or bone, were bound to handles with leather straps. During the Bronze Age, they were made of bronze with wooden handles. Due to its round hole, the tool head would spin on the handle. The Minoans developed oval-shaped holes in their tools to fit oval-shaped handles, which prevented spinning. Tools included double adzes, double- and single-bladed axes, axe-adzes, sickles and chisels.\n\n\n== Minoan women ==\nAs Linear A, Minoan writing, has not been decoded yet, almost all information available about Minoan women is from various art forms. Most importantly, women are depicted in fresco art paintings within various aspects of society such as child rearing, ritual participation, and worshiping.\n\nArtistically, women were portrayed very differently compared to the representations of men. Most obviously, men were often artistically represented with dark skin while women were represented with lighter skin. Fresco paintings also portray three class levels of women; elite women, women of the masses, and servants. A fourth, smaller class of women are also included among some paintings; these women are those who participated in religious and sacred tasks. Evidence for these different classes of women not only comes from fresco paintings but from Linear B tablets as well. Elite women were depicted within paintings as having a stature twice the size of women in lower classes, artistically this was a way of emphasizing the important difference between the elite wealthy women and the rest of the female population within society.Within paintings women were also portrayed as caretakers of children, however few frescoes portray pregnant women, most artistic representations of pregnant women are in the form of sculpted pots with the rounded base of the pots representing the pregnant belly.  Additionally, no Minoan art forms portray women giving birth, breast feeding, or procreating. Lack of such actions leads historians to believe that these actions would have been recognized by Minoan society to be either sacred or inappropriate. As public art pieces such as frescoes and pots do not illustrate these acts, it can be assumed that this part of a woman's life was kept private within society as a whole.\nNot only was childbirth a private subject within Minoan society but it was a dangerous process as well. Archeological sources have found numerous bones of pregnant women, identified as pregnant by the fetus bones within their skeleton found in the abdomen area. This leads to strong evidence that death during pregnancy and childbirth were common features within society. Further archeological evidence illustrates strong evidence for female death caused by nursing as well. Death of this population is attributed to the vast amount of nutrition and fat that women lost because of lactation which they often could not get back.\nAs stated above childcare was a central job for women within Minoan society, evidence for this can not only be found within art forms but also within the Linear B found in Mycenaean communities. Some of these sources describe the child-care practices common within Minoan society which help historians to better understand Minoan society and the role of women within these communities.\nOther roles outside the household that have been identified as women's duties are food gathering, food preparation, and household care-taking. Additionally, it has been found that women were represented in the artisan world as ceramic and textile craftswomen.As women got older it can be assumed that their jobs taking care of children ended and transitions to more of a priority towards household management and job mentoring, teaching younger women the jobs that they themselves participated in.\n\nMinoan dress representation also clearly marks the difference between men and women. Minoan men were often depicted clad in little clothing while women's bodies, specifically later on, were more covered up. While there is evidence that the structure of women's clothing originated as a mirror to the clothing that men wore, fresco art illustrates how women's clothing evolved to be more and more elaborate throughout the Minoan era. Throughout the evolutions of women's clothing, a strong emphasis was placed on the women's sexual characteristics, particularly the breasts. Female clothing throughout the Minoan era emphasized the breasts by exposing cleavage or even the entire breast. Similarly to the modern bodice women continue to wear today, Minoan women were portrayed with \u201cwasp\u201d waists. This means that the waist of women were constricted, made smaller by a tall belt or a tight lace bodice. Furthermore, not only women but men are illustrated wearing these accessories.\nWithin Minoan society and throughout the Minoan era, numerous documents written in Linear B have been found documenting Minoan families. Interestingly, spouses and children are not all listed together, in one section, fathers were listed with their sons, while mothers were listed with their daughter in a completely different section apart from the men who lived in the same household. This signifies the vast gender divide that was present within all aspects of society.\nMinoan society was a highly gendered and divided society separating men from women in clothing, art illustration, and societal duties. Scholarship about Minoan women remains limited.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\nThe Minoans were primarily a mercantile people who engaged in overseas trade. After 1700 BC, their culture indicates a high degree of organization. Minoan-manufactured goods suggest a network of trade with mainland Greece (notably Mycenae), Cyprus, Syria, Anatolia, Egypt, Mesopotamia and westward as far as the Iberian peninsula.  Minoan religion apparently focused on female deities, with women officiants. While historians and archaeologists have long been skeptical of an outright matriarchy, the predominance of female figures in authoritative roles over male ones seems to indicate that Minoan society was matriarchal, and among the most well-supported examples known.\n\n\n=== Government ===\nBecause their language has yet to be deciphered, it is unknown what kind of government was practiced by the Minoans, though the palaces and throne rooms indicate a form of hierarchy.\n\n\n=== Saffron trade ===\n\nA fresco of saffron-gatherers at Santorini is well-known. The Minoan trade in saffron, the stigma of a naturally-mutated crocus which originated in the Aegean basin, has left few material remains. According to Evans, the saffron (a sizable Minoan industry) was used for dye. Other archaeologists emphasize durable trade items: ceramics, copper, tin, gold and silver. The saffron may have had a religious significance. The saffron trade, which predated Minoan civilization, was comparable in value to that of frankincense or black pepper.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nMinoan men wore loincloths and kilts. Women wore robes with short sleeves and layered, flounced skirts. The robes were open to the navel, exposing their breasts. Women could also wear a strapless, fitted bodice, and clothing patterns had symmetrical, geometric designs.\n\n\n=== Language and writing ===\n\nSeveral writing systems dating from the Minoan period have been unearthed in Crete, the majority of which are currently undeciphered.\nThe most well-known script is Linear A, dated to between 2500 BC and 1450 BC. Linear A is the parent of the related Linear B script, which encodes the earliest known form of Greek. Several attempts to translate Linear A have been made, but consensus is lacking and Linear A is currently considered undeciphered.  The language encoded by Linear A is tentatively dubbed \"Minoan\". When the values of the symbols in Linear B are used in Linear A, they produce unintelligible words, and would make Minoan unrelated to any other known language. There is a belief that the Minoans used their written language primarily as an accounting tool and that even if deciphered, may offer little insight other than detailed descriptions of quantities.\nLinear A is preceded by about a century by the Cretan hieroglyphs. It is unknown whether the language is Minoan, and its origin is debated. Although the hieroglyphs are often associated with the Egyptians, they also indicate a relationship to Mesopotamian writings. They came into use about a century before Linear A, and were used at the same time as Linear A (18th century BC; MM II). The hieroglyphs disappeared during the 17th century BC (MM III).\nThe Phaistos Disc features a unique pictorial script. Although its origin is debated, it is now widely believed to be of Cretan origin. Because it is the only find of its kind, the script on the Phaistos disc remains undeciphered.\nIn addition to the above, five inscriptions dated to the 7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Eastern Crete (and possible as late as the 3rd century BC) written in an archaic Greek alphabet that encode a clearly non-Greek language, dubbed \"Eteocretan\" (lit. \"True Cretan\"). Given the small number of inscriptions, the language remains little-known. Eteocretan inscriptions are separated from Linear A by about a millennium, and it is thus unknown if Eteocretan represents a descendant of the Minoan language.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Minoans seem to have prominently worshiped a Great Goddess, which had previously led to the belief that their society was matriarchal. However it is now known that this was not the case; the Minoan pantheon featured many deities, among which a young, spear-wielding male god is also prominent. Some scholars see in the Minoan Goddess a female divine solar figure. Although some depictions of women may be images of worshipers and priestesses officiating at religious ceremonies (as opposed to deities), goddesses seem to include a mother goddess of fertility, a goddess of animals and female protectors of cities, the household, the harvest and the underworld. They are often represented by serpents, birds, poppies or an animal on the head.\nAccording to Nanno Marinatos, \"The hierarchy and relationship of gods within the pantheon is difficult to decode from the images alone.\" Marinatos disagrees with earlier descriptions of Minoan religion as primitive, saying that it \"was the religion of a sophisticated and urbanized palatial culture with a complex social hierarchy. It was not dominated by fertility any more than any religion of the past or present has been, and it addressed gender identity, rites of passage, and death. It is reasonable to assume that both the organization and the rituals, even the mythology, resembled the religions of Near Eastern palatial civilizations.\" It even seems that the later Greek pantheon would synthesize the Minoan female deity and Hittite goddess from the Near East.\n\n\n==== Symbolism ====\nMinoan horn-topped altars, which Arthur Evans called Horns of Consecration, are represented in seal impressions and have been found as far afield as Cyprus. Minoan sacred symbols include the bull (and its horns of consecration), the labrys (double-headed axe), the pillar, the serpent, the sun-disc, the tree, and even the Ankh.\n\nHaralampos V. Harissis and Anastasios V. Harissis posit a different interpretation of these symbols, saying that they were based on apiculture rather than religion. A major festival was exemplified in bull-leaping, represented in the frescoes of Knossos and inscribed in miniature seals.\n\n\n==== Burial practices ====\nSimilar to other Bronze Age archaeological finds, burial remains constitute much of the material and archaeological evidence for the period. By the end of the Second Palace Period, Minoan burial was dominated by two forms: circular tombs (tholoi) in southern Crete and house tombs in the north and the east. However, much Minoan mortuary practice does not conform to this pattern. Burial was more popular than cremation. Individual burial was the rule, except for the Chrysolakkos complex in Malia. Here, a number of buildings form a complex in the center of Mallia's burial area and may have been the focus for burial rituals or a crypt for a notable family. Evidence of possible human sacrifice by the Minoans has been found at three sites: at Anemospilia, in a MMII building near Mt. Juktas considered a temple; an EMII sanctuary complex at Fournou Korifi in south-central Crete, and in an LMIB building known as the North House in Knossos.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMinoan cities were connected by narrow roads paved with blocks cut with bronze saws. Streets were drained, and water and sewage facilities were available to the upper class through clay pipes.Minoan buildings often had flat, tiled roofs; plaster, wood or flagstone floors, and stood two to three stories high. Lower walls were typically constructed of stone and rubble, and the upper walls of mudbrick. Ceiling timbers held up the roofs.\nConstruction materials for villas and palaces varied, and included sandstone, gypsum and limestone. Building techniques also varied, with some palaces using ashlar masonry and others roughly-hewn, megalithic blocks.\nIn north-central Crete blue-greenschist was used as to pave floors of streets and courtyards between 1650 and 1600 BC. These rocks were likely quarried in Agia Pelagia on the north coast of central Crete.\n\n\n==== Palaces ====\n\nPalaces (anaktora) are the best-known Minoan building types excavated on Crete. They are monumental buildings with administrative purposes, as evidenced by large archives unearthed by archaeologists. Each palace excavated to date has unique features, but they also share aspects which set them apart from other structures. Palaces are often multi-story, with interior and exterior staircases, lightwells, massive columns, storage areas and courtyards.\nThe first palaces were constructed at the end of the Early Minoan period in the third millennium BC at Malia. Although it was formerly believed that the foundation of the first palaces was synchronous and dated to the Middle Minoan period (around 2000 BC, the date of the first palace at Knossos), scholars now think that the palaces were built over a longer period in response to local developments. The main older palaces are Knossos, Malia and Phaistos. Elements of the Middle Minoan palaces (at Knossos, Phaistos and Malia, for example) have precedents in Early Minoan construction styles. These include an indented western court and special treatment of the western fa\u00e7ade. One example is the House on the Hill at Vasiliki, dated to the Early Minoan II period. The palaces were centers of government, administrative offices, shrines, workshops and storage spaces.The Middle Minoan palaces are characteristically aligned with their surrounding topography. The MM palace of Phaistos appears to align with Mount Ida and Knossos is aligned with Mount Juktas, both on a north\u2013south axis. Scholars suggest that the alignment was related to the mountains' ritual significance; a number of peak sanctuaries (spaces for public ritual) have been excavated, including one at Petsofas. These sites have yielded clusters of clay figurines and evidence of animal sacrifice.\nLate palaces are characterized by multi-story buildings with west facades of sandstone ashlar masonry; Knossos is the best-known example. Other building conventions included storage areas, north\u2013south orientation, a pillar room and a western court. Architecture during the First Palace Period is identified by a square-within-a-square style; Second Palace Period construction has more internal divisions and corridors. The Palace of Knossos was the largest Minoan palace. The palace is about 150 meters across and it spreads over an area of some 20,000 square meters, with its original upper levels possibly having a thousand chambers. The palace is connected to the mythological story of The Bull of Minos, since it is in this palace where it was written that the labyrinth existed. Focusing on the architectural aspects of the Palace of Knossos, it was a combination of foundations that depended on the aspects of its walls for the dimensions of the rooms, staircases, porticos, and chambers. The palace was designed in such a fashion that the structure was laid out to surround the central court of the Minoans. Aesthetically speaking, the pillars along with the stone paved northern entrance gave the palace a look and feel that was unique to the Palace of Knossos. The space surrounding the court was covered with rooms and hallways, some of which were stacked on top of the lower levels of the palace being linked through multiple ramps and staircases. Others were built into a hill, as described by the site's excavator Arthur John Evans, \"...The palace of Knossos is the most extensive and occupies several hills.\" On the east side of the court there was a grand staircase passing through the many levels of the palace, added for the royal residents. On the west side of the court, the throne room, a modest room with a ceiling some two meters high, can be found along with the frescoes that were decorating the walls of the hallways and storage rooms.\n\n\n==== Plumbing ====\nDuring the Minoan Era extensive waterways were built in order to protect the growing population. These system had two primary functions, first providing and distributing water, and secondly relocating sewage and stormwater. One of the defining aspects of the Minoan Era was the architectural feats of their waste management. The Minoans used technologies such as wells, cisterns, and aqueducts to manage their water supplies. Structural aspects of their buildings even played a part. Flat roofs and plentiful open courtyards were used for collecting water to be stored in cisterns. Significantly, the Minoans had water treatment devices. One such device seems to have been a porous clay pipe through which water was allowed to flow until clean.\n\n\n==== Columns ====\n\nFor sustaining of the roof, some higher houses, especially the palaces, used columns made usually of cupressus sempervirens, and sometimes of stone. One of the most notable Minoan contributions to architecture is their inverted column, wider at the top than the base (unlike most Greek columns, which are wider at the bottom to give an impression of height). The columns were made of wood (not stone) and were generally painted red. Mounted on a simple stone base, they were topped with a pillow-like, round capital.\n\n\n==== Villas ====\nA number of compounds known as \"villas\" have been excavated on Crete. These structures share features of neopalatial palaces: a conspicuous western facade, storage facilities and a three-part Minoan Hall. These features may indicate a similar role or that the structures were artistic imitations, suggesting that their occupants were familiar with palatial culture. The villas were often richly decorated, as evidenced by the frescos of Haghia Triadha Villa A.\nA common characteristic of the Minoan villas was having flat roofs. Their rooms didn't have windows to the streets, the light arriving from courtyards. In the 2nd millennium BC, the villas had one or two floors, and the palaces even three.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nThe largest collection of Minoan art is in the museum at Heraklion, near Knossos, on the northern coast of Crete. Minoan art and other remnants of material culture, especially the sequence of ceramic styles, have been used by archaeologists to define the three phases of Minoan culture (EM, MM, LM).\nSince wood and textiles have decomposed, the best-preserved (and most instructive) surviving examples of Minoan art are its pottery, palace architecture (with frescos which include landscapes), stone carvings and intricately-carved seal stones.\nFrescoes were the primary art form of Minoan culture. They include many depictions of people, with sexes distinguished by color; the men's skin is reddish-brown, and the women's white. Several frescoes at Knossos and Santorini survive. In contrast to Egyptian frescoes, Crete had true frescoes. Probably the most famous fresco is the bull-leaping fresco. The main colours used in Minoan frescos were black (shale), white (slaked lime), red (hematite), yellow (ochre), blue (copper silicate) and green (yellow and blue mixed together).\n\n\n==== Pottery ====\n\nA variety of wares were produced in Crete. Early Minoan ceramics were characterized by patterns of spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses, fish bones, and beak-spouts. During the Middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs (such as fish, squid, birds and lilies) were common. In the Late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still characteristic but more variety existed.\nThe palace style of the region around Knossos is characterized by geometric simplicity and monochromatic painting. Late Minoan art resembles that of Mycenae. Minoan knowledge of the sea was continued by the Mycenaeans in their frequent use of marine forms as artistic motifs. The so-called \"marine style\" has the entire surface of a pot covered with sea creatures, octopus, fish and dolphins, against a background of rocks, seaweed and sponges.\n\n\n==== Jewelry ====\nThe Minoans created elaborate metalwork with imported gold and copper. Bead necklaces, bracelets and hair ornaments appear in the frescoes, and many labrys pins survive. The Minoans apparently mastered faience and granulation, as indicated by a gold bee pendant. Minoan metalworking included intense, precise temperature, to bond gold to itself without burning it.\n\n\n==== Metal vessels ====\n\nMetal vessels were produced in Crete from at least as early as EM II (c. 2500 BC) in the Prepalatial period through to LM IA (c. 1450 BC) in the Postpalatial period and perhaps as late as LM IIIB/C (c. 1200 BC), although it is likely that many of the vessels from these later periods were heirlooms from earlier periods.  The earliest were probably made exclusively from precious metals, but from the Protopalatial period (MM IB \u2013 MM IIA) they were also produced in arsenical bronze and, subsequently, tin bronze.  The archaeological record suggests that mostly cup-type forms were created in precious metals, but the corpus of bronze vessels was diverse, including cauldrons, pans, hydrias, bowls, pitchers, basins, cups, ladles and lamps.  The Minoan metal vessel tradition influenced that of the Mycenaean culture on mainland Greece, and they are often regarded as the same tradition.  Many precious metal vessels found on mainland Greece exhibit Minoan characteristics, and it is thought that these were either imported from Crete or made on the mainland by Minoan metalsmiths working for Mycenaean patrons or by Mycenaean smiths who had trained under Minoan masters.\n\n\n=== Warfare and the \"Minoan peace\" ===\nAccording to Arthur Evans, a \"Minoan peace\" (Pax Minoica) existed; there was little internal armed conflict in Minoan Crete until the Mycenaean period. However, it is difficult to draw hard-and-fast conclusions from the evidence and Evans' idealistic view has been questioned.No evidence has been found of a Minoan army or the Minoan domination of peoples beyond Crete, and few signs of warfare appear in Minoan art: \"Although a few archaeologists see war scenes in a few pieces of Minoan art, others interpret even these scenes as festivals, sacred dance, or sports events\" (Studebaker, 2004, p. 27). Although armed warriors are depicted as stabbed in the throat with swords, the violence may be part of a ritual or blood sport.On mainland Greece during the shaft-grave era at Mycenae, there is little evidence for major Mycenaean fortifications; the citadels follow the destruction of nearly all neopalatial Cretan sites. Warfare by other contemporaries of the ancient Minoans, such as the Egyptians and the Hittites, is well-documented.\n\n\n==== Skepticism and weaponry ====\n\nDespite finding ruined watchtowers and fortification walls, Evans said that there was little evidence of ancient Minoan fortifications. According to Stylianos Alexiou (in Kretologia 8), a number of sites (especially early and middle Minoan sites such as Aghia Photia) are built on hilltops or otherwise fortified. Lucia Nixon wrote:\n\nWe may have been over-influenced by the lack of what we might think of as solid fortifications to assess the archaeological evidence properly. As in so many other instances, we may not have been looking for evidence in the right places, and therefore we may not end with a correct assessment of the Minoans and their ability to avoid war.\nChester Starr said in \"Minoan Flower Lovers\" that since Shang China and the Maya had unfortified centers and engaged in frontier struggles, a lack of fortifications alone does not prove that the Minoans were a peaceful civilization unparalleled in history. In 1998, when Minoan archaeologists met in a Belgian conference to discuss the possibility that the Pax Minoica was outdated, evidence of Minoan war was still scanty. According to Jan Driessen, the Minoans frequently depicted \"weapons\" in their art in a ritual context:\n\nThe construction of fortified sites is often assumed to reflect a threat of warfare, but such fortified centres were multifunctional; they were also often the embodiment or material expression of the central places of the territories at the same time as being monuments glorifying and merging leading power.\nStella Chryssoulaki's work on small outposts (or guardhouses) in eastern Crete indicates a possible defensive system; type A (high-quality) Minoan swords were found in the palaces of Mallia and Zarkos (see Sanders, AJA 65, 67, Hoeckmann, JRGZM 27, or Rehak and Younger, AJA 102). Keith Branigan estimated that 95 percent of Minoan \"weapons\" had hafting (hilts or handles) which would have prevented their use as such. However, tests of replicas indicated that the weapons could cut flesh down to the bone (and score the bone's surface) without damaging the weapons themselves. According to Paul Rehak, Minoan figure-eight shields could not have been used for fighting or hunting, since they were too cumbersome. Although Cheryl Floyd concluded that Minoan \"weapons\" were tools used for mundane tasks such as meat processing,  Middle Minoan \"rapiers nearly three feet in length\" have been found.About Minoan warfare, Branigan concluded:\n\nThe quantity of weaponry, the impressive fortifications, and the aggressive looking long-boats all suggested an era of intensified hostilities. But on closer inspection there are grounds for thinking that all three key elements are bound up as much with status statements, display, and fashion as with aggression;... Warfare such as there was in the southern Aegean early Bronze Age was either personalized and perhaps ritualized (in Crete) or small-scale, intermittent and essentially an economic activity (in the Cyclades and the Argolid/Attica).\nArchaeologist Olga Krzyszkowska agreed: \"The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no direct evidence for war and warfare per se.\"\n\n\n== Collapse ==\n\nBetween 1935 and 1939, Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited the Minoan eruption theory. An eruption on the island of Thera (present-day Santorini), about 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Crete, occurred during the LM IA period (1550\u20131500 BC). One of the largest volcanic explosions in recorded history, it ejected about 60 to 100 cubic kilometres (14 to 24 cu mi) of material and was measured at 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini, which was entombed in a layer of pumice.\nAlthough it is believed to have severely affected the Minoan culture of Crete, the extent of its effects has been debated. Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant life on the eastern half of Crete, starving the local population; however, more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more than 5 millimetres (0.20 in) of ash fell anywhere on Crete. Based on archaeological evidence, studies indicate that a massive tsunami generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements. Although the LM IIIA (late Minoan) period is characterized by affluence (wealthy tombs, burials and art) and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles, by LM IIIB Knossos' wealth and importance as a regional center apparently declined.\nSignificant remains have been found above the late Minoan I-era Thera ash layer, implying that the Thera eruption did not cause the immediate collapse of Minoan civilization. The Minoans were a sea power, however, and the Thera eruption probably caused significant economic hardship. Whether this was enough to trigger a Minoan downfall is debated. Mycenaean Greece conquered the Minoans during the late Minoan II period, and Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete soon after the eruption.Many archaeologists believe that the eruption triggered a crisis, making the Minoans vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans. According to Sinclair Hood, the Minoans were most likely conquered by an invading force. Although the civilization's collapse was aided by the Thera eruption, its ultimate end came from conquest. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was destroyed by fire, with the palace at Knossos receiving less damage than other sites on Crete. Since natural disasters are not selective, the uneven destruction was probably caused by invaders who would have seen the usefulness of preserving a palace like Knossos for their own use. Several authors have noted evidence that Minoan civilization had exceeded its environmental carrying capacity, with archaeological recovery at Knossos indicating deforestation in the region near the civilization's later stages.\n\n\n== Genetic studies ==\nA 2013 archeogenetics study compared skeletal mtDNA from ancient Minoan skeletons that were sealed in a cave in the Lasithi Plateau between 3,700 and 4,400 years ago, to 135 samples from Greece, Anatolia, western and northern Europe, North Africa and Egypt. The researchers found that the Minoan skeletons were genetically very similar to modern-day Europeans\u2014and especially close to modern-day Cretans, particularly those from the Lasithi Plateau. They were also genetically similar to Neolithic Europeans, but distinct from Egyptian or Libyan populations. \"We now know that the founders of the first advanced European civilization were European,\" said study co-author George Stamatoyannopoulos, a human geneticist at the University of Washington. \"They were very similar to Neolithic Europeans and very similar to present day-Cretans.\"A 2017 archeogenetics full genome sequencing study of Minoan remains published in the journal Nature concluded that the Mycenean Greeks were genetically closely related with the Minoans, and that both are closely related, but not identical, to modern Greek populations. The same study also stated that at least three-quarters of the ancestral DNA of both the Minoans and the Myceneans came from the first Neolithic-era farmers that lived in Western Anatolia and the Aegean Sea. The remaining ancestry of the Minoans came from prehistoric populations related to those of the Caucasus and Iran, while the Mycenaean Greeks also carried this component. Unlike the Minoans however, the Myceneans carried a small 13-18% Bronze Age Pontic-Caspian steppe component. Whether the 'northern' ancestry in Mycenaeans was due to sporadic infiltration of Steppe-related populations in Greece, or the result of a rapid migration as in Central Europe, is not certain yet. Such a migration would support the idea that Proto-Greek speakers formed the southern wing of a steppe intrusion of Indo-European speakers. Yet, the absence of \u2018northern\u2019 ancestry in the Bronze Age samples from Pisidia, where Indo-European languages were attested in antiquity, casts doubt on this genetic-linguistic association, with further sampling of ancient Anatolian speakers needed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtlantis\nCaucasus\nHyksos\nMinoa\nSacred caves of Crete\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Sunday 23rd August and we drove the 42 kilometres, an hours drive,  from our hotel in Analipsi to visit the Cave. Psychro Cave is also known as Diktaion Andron and is located in the south of Lasithi Plateau and is 1,025 metres above sea level. Having parked up the car, there",
          "The cave is not really very big, but a the bottom are some pools and curtain stalactites and stalagmites. The process was very smooth and the path was pretty well kept. There is a 500 meter wall uphill, but if you want a donkey ride is available for 10 eur.",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but really enjoyed the trip. The walk up is step hit the views are spectacular. Once you reach the cave you must wear a mask. Inside you enter another world and can understand why it became a ritual site.",
          "When on holiday you must get into action once in a while. One of the nice destinations when driving a rental is the Lasithi plateau. It looks very original and ancient and villages are old and people friendly, like in the rest of Crete. When parking, look for a spot all the way",
          "One of two places claiming to be the birthplace of Zeus. Quite climb up to the entrance but you can take a donkey ride up if you prefer. Great views across the Lasithi plateau before you enter this amazing deep cave.",
          "It is worth visiting this place, cost 6 euros. It is a 10- 15 minutes climb but not to demanding and you can stop and admire views. The whole plateau is very interesting place so different from touristic beaches and hotels. The are gift shops and restaurants on the top so you",
          "This was a fantastic climb up to the cave where Zeus was hidden by his mother. Amazing and friendly people who could have charged a king\u2019s ransom for this epic cave but they did not. Really worth the trip. You must see this place and the views nearby are outstanding.",
          "We visited on 19th October, so it was definitely open. The other comments are correct about the climb and need for sensible footwear. I would save your 10Euros for something other than a donkey ride. We're physically fit, and it is demanding. If you can't manage the walk up,",
          "The setting on the plateau is interesting. However from the complex entrance there is a long zig zag steep slope to get to the cave entrance that takes some time and requires a degree of fitness (or hire the services of a donkey). Once at the mouth of the cave there are several",
          "Until you start the climb, it all looks easy to get to the cave. If you fancy a donkey ride, 10 euros will ease the pain but will make your fear of heights worse! Once at the top you descent into the dimly lit cave. No flash photography allowed but a decent camera phone will",
          "Excellent attraction. Cave was very interesting to visit. Great geographical features. Lung busting walk up the hill to get to cave.",
          "In order to get to the cave, you must first walk up a gravel path - it\u2019s about 1km, and probably a couple of hundred feet of ascent. Not for the faint hearted on a hot day. Once you get there, it is worth the effort. Lovely and cool, very spectacular natural rock formations.",
          "This is one of the \u2018must do\u2019 things to do in Crete, located above the Lassithi plateau. Access is via a long steep well maintained path, there is an option to take a donkey ride for a 10 euro fee instead of walking but I think that\u2019s cruel. Be aware that the last 50 meters to",
          "This is wonderful example of cave. Very busy place and the people protecting the car park Sent us away saying it is full and told us to park down the road. But anyone a bit older looking or does not seem erto understand gets to park. Fair enough for older people to get to park",
          "I love Greek mythology, so had to visit the birth place of Zeus. The cave was beautiful, although no sighting of any Greeks gods. There are 2 paths, the left is flatter, but kids enjoyed scrambling up the right-side path. It takes a good 15 minutes, there was a short queue",
          "Entrance to get into the cave is six euros for adults and free for children. Don't do this in flip flops as the stone path is not even. The path is around 1 km to the top and is achievable for most people. Avoid holding on to the guide rail as you end up with rust covered",
          "This is the famous cave in which the legend says Zeus was born, it's an incredible cave very well prepared to visit that you shouldn't forget in your trip to Crete, you'd get there earlier in the morning to avoid hot temperatures and parking issues, the way to go to the entrance",
          "We took a drive upto the plateau to see this cave. The parking was manic and the walk up the zig-zag path was tiring but when you enter the cave it is so cool and fresh, better than air-con. The curious stalagmites and rock formations must have been a great source of wonder to",
          "It was a very long drive up. Once we got there it's 2.50 euro to park your car, 10 euro to ride the donkey up and another 10 on the way back and then 6 euro each for entry. It is a very steep to get up to the top, it was very hot and crowed. Once your in the cave because it is",
          "After a hot walk up the hillside to the entrance, it was wonderful to enter the dark, cool, moist cave. Lots of stalagmites/tites to see. Zeus must have liked it here. ;-)",
          "The cave is well worth a visit but you need to be fairly fit and healthy to make the climb up to the cave. My advice would be to go early morning when it is cooler and hopefully a little quieter.",
          "Absolutely worth the visit, a fascinating cave with added mythology. A word of warning though, it is a steep path up to the cave and then 200ish steps down into the cave (and obviously the same back up) so it is not suitable for everyone. Obviously it is a bit of a tourist trap",
          "Drive up to the plateau is not for the faint hearted! Excellent views if you have the nerve to look down. Cafes, toilets and gift shops available. The cave is spectacular and well worth a visit. It is a 15 minute walk up to the cave from the car park and the path is quite steep",
          "6 euros for a cave where you just can walk for 5 minutes, big disappointment. Niet de moeite om de hele berg te beklimmen voor 5 minuten in de grot te zijn geweest.",
          "We parked the car in the square at the bottom of the steep hill up to the caves. It\u2019s a long and winding crazy paved pathway for most of the walk. The last part of the walk has rough stones to climb over. As other people have mentioned, good strong non slip footwear is",
          "Definitely worth the trip! Make sure you wear proper shoes and bring water and sun protection. The hike up there is a little bit of a challenge in the heat but well worth it, we enjoyed visiting the cave!",
          "it;s unbelievable experience in one day tour to Lassithi and Dikteon cave we hd ith Sparrow travel. As we already mentioned we found our tour operator offers too overpriced, so we chose to go in local trips with local tour agency Sparrow travel. After Spinalonga boat tour we",
          "Allegedly the birthplace of Zeus, the Dikteon Cave is now a tourist destination. Car Parking costs 2.5 Euros and from there it\u2019s a steep uphill climb for about 1km to the cave entrance. Appropriate footwear is required. Because the path is so steep, locals offer donkey rides at",
          "This is a stalactite cave and supposedly the birthplace of Zeus and the place where his mother hid the young god from his father Kronos. To be honest: there are more impressive stalactite caves in the world. It's the Greek mythology that motivated me to hike up the mountain. The",
          "Yes its a steep walk uphill ( there are two paths, the one to the left is the easier modern one, the one to the right rockier but quieter) but well worth it. A highlight of a days trip up to the plateau. All the donkeys we saw at this site appeared well cared for and with",
          "We visited the site as part of a day out safari trip so didn't need to make a special trip as not sure it's particularly worth it to do just that but the journey to it provides spectacular scenery if you choose your route wisely. It's a heritage site with a \u20ac6 entry fee but as",
          "Be prepared for a long walk up the steep path! Wear reasonable shoes and take water with you. For me, two days after epic Samaria hike, this was very hard, but totally worth it. Beautiful cave, nice lights, very impressive place, even if you are not in to history. The only thing",
          "It takes about 20 minutes walking steadily uphill in the sun to get to the cave so you have be reasonably fit and have appropriate footwear. You pay 6 euros at the top in order to go down a lot of steep steps into the cave. Impressive size and some large stalagmites and",
          "From Elounda it was a 1 hour and 20 minutes journey by car. Some of the roads were very picturesque and it\u2019s probably worth planning in 5-10 minutes for quick picture stops. See if you can get a picture of the escarpment with a row of Ancient Greek windmills or the spit of land",
          "A small group of us went to the see the cave and I'll get to that later. What I'm warning others about is one of the restaurant owners who attacked my husband. The restaurant is the one at the base of the cave in line with the other shops. Not to be confused with the one that",
          "You have to make a trip otherwise to come only here is not smart. Easy climbing one way we need 20min go back 15min and about 15min inside. Who never was in stalagmite or stalactite place then I recommend.",
          "From car park to cave entrance is one hell of a climb if you\u2019re not in reasonable condition imo. You could always hire a donkey to ease the trip ! First mention of entrance fee is at the top !! Narrow staircase down into first chamber constant start stop with the selfie",
          "We were unsure about this trip because of the variety of the reviews it got on here. However, it was a good day out. Firstly, if you consider the drive there just as a means of getting there then yes, it is a long way. If you consider it an adventurer in itself then it is worth",
          "Not worth the trip and the climb if you are going just for the cave. The cave itself seems to have been artificially \u201credecorated\u201d i.e., stalagmites without the corresponding stalactites,...the cave itself takes about 5 minutes to look at.",
          "We found the cave using Google Maps. It is called Dikton cave Or cave of Psychros. Some shops/restaurants at the bottom of the climb. We took the \u2018easy\u2019 path up. (It is the left one when you stand with your back to the carpark). Stuck the kids (8 and 10 years old) on a donkey.",
          "My wife and I were in Crete in July 2018 and as we like to explore we rented a car and took to the internet to find some of the must see spots in Crete. The Cave of Zeus or Dikteon Cave or Psychro Cave or whatever name people want to call it wad among these must see spots. It",
          "This is very special indeed.its quite a long walk especially up to it as all up hill, should take you about 45mins but the views are well worth it.when you get to the cave itself take care as very dark especially when contrasted with the blazing sun outside.the cave is",
          "A really cool place (both figuratively and literally). If you know the story of Zeus and Cronus then seeing this in person is amazing. Its pretty cold in the cave so a light jacket may be needed if you are in there for a while and be careful of the steps leading down as the",
          "The walk up to the cave is very long and steep, but the view at the top is more than worth it. The cave itself is eerie, creepy and breathtaking. It\u2019s a steep stepped walk down into the cold and dark but is a beautiful and mesmerising experience. The price is more than",
          "We really liked this cave ant the hike up to it. We've been going there with 3 y.o. child ant he did it great! It wasn't challenging :) The view from The top is stunning :) of course you will have to make many steps on stairs down to the cave, but they are managible even if you",
          "A nice enough place to visit with some beautiful scenery and worth the trip. Be prepared for a very steep 20 minute walk up to the cave. Sensible footwear is a must as we rocked up in flip flops! One other thing that I must add is that you can pay for a donkey ride up to the",
          "You park in the carpark where you have to pay \u20ac2.50.Than be prepared for a very steep climb up a good pathway.There is donkeys which you can take up and down.There is a charge of \u20ac6 per person for enterance but try to have right money as guy very grumpy to give change!It is a",
          "This trip is not for anyone who has walking difficulties or suffers from heart problems, you get to the car park and then it walking 1km uphill, then take the 200 steps down into the cave and yes 200 steps to get out and then reek back down the 1km again, given all that well",
          "Arrived in the Psychro village , a paved path goes up to the cave. Only latest 30 mt is a little bit difficult due to the uneven soil. A group of donkeys make service up to the cave, for the happiness of children and not. Before going into the cave , read the display where the",
          "Visited the cave today as part of a tour and very much enjoyed the cave - it\u2019s deep and dark and atmospheric. However the climb up was an absolute ball-ache and came utterly without warning. It\u2019s at least a 25 min climb up a steep road with uneven paving. Be prepared to sweat!",
          "We visited this attraction today. Paid 2.5 Euros for the car park (its another 6 each at the top). A little way up the hill there is a place where you can pay someone to take you up on a donkey. We were disgusted to see a really large man getting onto a very small Donkey. His",
          "Visting the Dikteon/Psychro cave you can feel how much history is embedded there. The walk up to the cave is not for the faint hearted or for people with mobility issues. I use a walking stick and found the steep hill a challenge but it was really worth the effort. For those who",
          "That's it. Not worth paying. We have seeing lot nicer bigger caves for lot less or free. Greeks will have to make money there. Small cave and paid for car park. Rip off big time. Avoid at all cost.",
          "There is a steep walk up to the cave but the path is good most of the way, the final 100metres is very rough and can be slippery in the certain weather conditions",
          "This cave considered to be the birthplace of Zeus. You can get there after a nice walk from the village, however you should bring warm clothes with you, because the temperature of the cave relatively cold. It is mandatory to see.",
          "Lovely cave system for everyone to enjoy. Cheap at only \u20ac6 euros each to enter babies free. The ticket office is right at the top of the hill walk. If you drive go early! There are a minimal number if car spaces and there were only 1 possible 2 spaces free mid October in low",
          "Cave of stalactites and stalagmites that aren't the most amazing but are still great to see. The patterns made in the rocks naturally make it a little creepy (see pics), but there's nothing to be afraid of. I read somewhere that you could come into contact with bats and while",
          "Be ready for a bit of climbing and a lot of steps but the view you will be able to see is price less. If you are there you must see them!!! Not recommended for disable person. Price of ticket is \u20ac6 per person. Some of stalactites are destroyed what is heart breaking cause is",
          "The mythology behind the cave is cool but the cave itself is very not special. We have many awesome caves in the US and have seen excellent ones overseas like Mallorca. This cave is very small and has few stalagmites and stalactites. Many worn down by visitors. The shops at the",
          "The cave is amazing but during a hot day takes a lot of effort to get up there . Next time I d go early morning or late afternoon. Inside the cave the temperature is 18 degree so nice after all the climbing . if you are interested in history this is a must. Ticket to enter is 6",
          "Ok, it's a cave not a work of art but we really enjoyed our visit here. The hike up the hill/mountain was a bit of a challenge in the heat especially given that we live in Norfolk in the uk where our stair case is the tallest hill for miles around. I've been in caves and mines",
          "You climb a huge mountain, but the reward is worth it! 2.5 \u20ac to park, 6\u20ac to enter the cave... wear sensible climbing shoes! Great activity for a hot day--it was a cool 50 degrees F on the cave!!! Fabulous views inside!!! Turns out there is an easy sidewalk to go up and down on",
          "We visited with our 8 year old daughter. She was not enthusiastic about the walk up to the caves but in the end enjoyed the challenge and we enjoyed the physical activity and beautiful views. At the top we enjoyed looking around the cave - it's not big but in terms of keeping a",
          "Check my review of \"Cave of Zeus\" since it is the same cave or just go there because it is worth the visit!",
          "We like caves a lot - and this cave is certainly not the most interesting one. It is just a (relatively) small cave with a single hall. 10-15 minutes is enough to do the tour (is not worth the price, IMHO). There are different formations, like stalactites and stalagmites (which",
          "We drove to this cave from the Malia area. A lovely route took us through the mountains and valleys. When we arrived, the car park was busy, but there were people directing you empty spaces (parking approx \u20ac3). We then walked the stone/uneven path up to the cave - please note",
          "Excellent for young -family and kids - if kids get tired - hire a Donkey! For the elderly its not very easy to access (unless they ride a donkey!) + lots of stairs within the cave Not very big cave, - full of stalactites, stalagmites + small lake at the bottom",
          "Fantastic cave. Lot to learn for Greek mythology of Zeus. Many stairs to walk and mountain trophy car but it worth it",
          "When designing the two week tour around the island we have put the Dikteon (Psychro) cave on the list due to its mythology. But all the visit gave more than expected. I liked a walk to the entrance (for older persons not that easy). The cave was bigger than expected.",
          "This is one of the to go touristy spot when in Crete. Supposedly Zeus's birthplace. The walk to the top was a workout! Be prepared! If you can walk, please walk, and not rent the poor donkeys! The cave itself was eerie, pretty, magical, cold. They should put on more lights",
          "The cave is in the mountains surrounding the Lassithi Plateau and is a very long and steep climb, but totally worth it. Please don't be tempted to ride one of the poor old donkeys, just take your time and drink plenty of water. Inside the cave are stalactites and stalagmites",
          "Came with two young children. It's very touristy which was a surprise after a lovely quiet drive through the mountains & villages. Nice scenic walk up from the car park and the cave itself was lovely and cool, although not as big as expected - not a patch on Sfendoni cave - but",
          "Visiting the Lasithi Plateau we thought the cave was a 'must see' from all the glowing reviews, but having just visited some caves in Slovenia the Zeus Cave was very disappointing. Firstly it is a long hard climb up to the cave with the path being quite poor for the final",
          "There are two competing Caves of Zeus. This one is also called the Psychro Cave, and is in the Dikte Mountain over Lasithi Plane in Eastern Crete. It appears to be a popular destination, so there is a lot of touristy infrastructure built around it. It is relatively easy to get",
          "Walk up the hill to go inside, some take donkeys for 10 Eu each way, they looked like they might slip on the rocks. The view from the plateau is incredible, very much worth the drive. Sadly the stalagmites and such are going dark from the elements.",
          "Came here as part of a tour to the plateau, There is a steep fairly long climb up to the cave, I have walking difficulties and it was a bit of a challenge, I recommend you wear good shoes and avoid the hottest parts of the day. You could go up on a Donkey for 10 Euro but I",
          "The cave was interesting with some nice stalagmites and stalactites. As previous reviews have stated not enough information is provided, only a board where the lady takes the ticket. Best to read about it before you go. The path is very steep and not so good the nearer the",
          "To get to the cave there are 2 paths, a difficult one and an easier one. I took the easy one This 150 meter path is still a steep path but paved almost to the top. It's possible to get to the top on a donkey! The entrance is \u20ac 6 and you walk through the cave via oneway",
          "If Zeus finds out that the cave where he \"born\" is so poorly maintained, he could punish someone with a few thunder and lightning! ; ) The cave itself, is just that, a natural formation. But those who are in charge of it, need to give better maintenance and care. Although it",
          "It is a hard climb up and then a further climb down into and back out of the cave. It is however worth it as the stalagmites and stalactites are amazing particularly bearing in mind their age. You also have a good view of the Lasithi plateau from the cave entrance.",
          "Visited the cave today on the Lassithi Platform. Once you arrive someone will guide you to a parking space and you have to pay 2,50 for the car park. Then you walk besides some taverna's and shops to the entrance of the stone trail that leads to the cave. This trail is pretty",
          "Located at Lassithi Plateau (I recommend to drive and stop there also). Very nice, my 1st experience in this kind of caves at all. Not the biggest one (as much I have read-watched about caves) but good to start to discover caves' world I think. From parking area to the cave",
          "I really enjoyed this as part of a larger tour, but it's good to be aware of a few issues. First- There is a VERY steep climb up to the actul cave from the car park. We were told by our guide 150 m. Not 150 m straight up a very steep, winding path. As my partner has health and",
          "So, we got here not knowing much. Is a tourist MUST when in the Lesithi area. A good 15 minutes walk uphill so mind you on a hot day one should start early.... the path is paved but no shade so..... Entrance is 6euro, and than you walk down 100 stairs into the cave and climb up",
          "We visited this as part of a day tour with Sparrow Travel. The guide was excellent and we saw Lisithi Plateau as well. The cave is stunning and the walk up to it, although intitally a little steep is not a problem - there's a clear path all the way.The cave itself has lots of",
          "The cave is an interesting place to visit, combined with the views and the unusual aspect of the Lasithi valley well worth a visit. However it is quite remote so would suggest combining the trip with something else in the area as unless you are on the east side of the island it",
          "Definitely worth renting a car to go and see! Although the hill walking up to the top is hard work it is worth it one you are up there. Steps down and up through the cave which are wet and slippery but there is a hand rail available and slight lighting. Wouldn't recommend for",
          "The walk up is well laid out and similar to walking up a long hill. It's hard to navigate as there are a few turns to get there but it's worth the trip. The cave is interesting and beautiful - this adds to the palace Knossis visit.",
          "Was told originally that it was thought to be Zeus' birthplace, later found its one of many caves Zeus was thought to be born in. Beautiful cave nonetheless and very interesting to see and be in. Quite a steep hill to walk up, donkeys are available but they looked pretty sad amd",
          "Went to this cave on a classics university trip. Going up we went up the step uneven rocks on the right and while not dangerous they are slippery in winter so not suggested for people with an injury. The view from the top is amazing. We got in for free on a free day (Sunday).",
          "Lots of steps, which were pretty treacherous in the rain, it was out of season so no donkeys, but not a problem if you were careful. \u20ac2.50 to park the car & \u20ac8 to visit the cave, so could get pricey for a large family. The cave is very pretty, still lots of stalactites and",
          "If you are expecting a visit to a nice cave then you will enjoy this one. Yes there are lots of steps but it's not bad if you are normally an active person. Many of the stalactites have been cut taking away a little bit. If you are expecting some artifacts or ruins indicating",
          "We visited the cave on a day trip to Lasithi Plateau. Good parking for cars and coaches with good facilities, cafes and shops. Walk to cave entrance is up a well made path but could be classed as hard. Fantastic views across plateau from entrance",
          "We visited today with our two young boys. They are too young to understand about Zeus, or stalactites but our 2 y/o was very taken with the donkeys. On a serious note this is a very impressive cave and the descent into it is pretty breathtaking. It's not massive, and is probably",
          "You have a little road to do but the stalactites are really nice!!! You have for 20min walking Be careful there is no access for while chair. Kids can do the walk by donkey for 10 \u20ac",
          "I stayed in malia, I hired a decent quad for the week, so I decided to venture up into the mountains to see the birth place of Zeus! Lovely scenic drive meandering through the mountains, once you arrive, you park at a little strip, with gift shops etc, 2 euros parking fee, the",
          "The cave in general is difficult to get to. It took us 1.5 hours to get there from Elounda, it took us the same amount of time to get all the way to Knossos from Elounda! Because it's so high up with so many switchbacks the drive is slow and I got quite motion sick! Once you get",

          "The beautiful walk to this cave is not too steep, only in places. You are met at the entrance by the caveman who will provide you with a torch , at a small cost, and will tell you the history behind this cave. To see a church built inside this cave is quite a sight. Well worth",
          "It was fine, except we almost couldn't get in because even tho everyone in the area offers free wifi, they don't take credit cards! Cave itself is a nifty little cave, but requires some imagination on the visitor's part.",

          "This is a small deep cave, the best of the three thousand there are in Crete. I have seen better ones all over Europe and in the Peloponese. It is interesting however from the mythological point of view and only if you read about it, before you go, since there is no information",
          "The ancient myth about Zeus' place of birth is still vivid and popular. If you are patient and enjoy driving on the mountains, then this excursion will meet your tastes. The walk in the cave is very short...shorter than your expectations! Unfortunately, the donkeys' owners",

          "The drive to the plateau and the view over the valley just before the entrance is worth the effort. The cave itself, it you ever visited any other cave anywhere in the world, is utterly disappointing. Don't waste your money even though it only costs 4 euro per person.",
          "We should have read all the reviews. The coordinates that we followed were indeed wrong so they brought us to a beekeeping place, not a cave. No place to buy water nearby which is not so nice after an 8km uphill walk from Malia. They view on the way was nice but that's about it.",

          "Allegedly the birthplace of Zeus, this is a relatively small but impressive cave. The fee is minimal and there are some Eateries nearby. Do take shoes for your visit. It is about a 15-20 min walk up a steep paved path to the caves which in the midday heat with kids is not",
          "We found this on a visit to the Plateau, and so glad we did. The caves were very impressive! 4 euros to get into the cave. A 1KM walk up to the cave, but this is on a winding path with many opportunities to stop for photo opportunities ( AKA trying to get my breath back stops).",
          "Nice morning out, cheap trip for a family of four, 8 euro enter fee plus 2 euros for parking. Climb up is a bit steep, but if your reasonably active then its no problem, our 8 & 12 year olds found it OK. Views are amazing and in my opinion probably better than the actual cave.",

          "What I like in Grece is that they linked every place in their country with a nice mythological story. The Dikteon cave is reachable after a small but steep climb (donkeys available but not all the way to the cave). Up on the hill the view is wonderful and it`s worth some time of",
          "If you have visited a cave elsewhere (I mean a real one) do not go. Visit the Lassithi plateau and its villages. Stop in krasi, you will find several good taverna, have a good meal and spend the 4 euros you saved (cave entrance cost) having a raki. And if by chance you visited",
          "Fantastic place to visit, beautiful views both inside and outside the cave. The walk up to the cave was invigorating, and don't forget to take some money up to the cave to pay for the entrance fee of \u20ac4 which only the Adults paid. HOWEVER!!! Do Not follow the tripadvisor map",
          "A long climb up a steep and bumpy track - not for the inform or the faint hearted. If you get out of breath just pause to take some spectacular shots of the changing view as you go higher and higher. At the top you descend down steps hewn out of the rock (there is a handrail!)",

          "Read some other reviews about the climb to get there, it's fine just make sure you are wearing trainers. It was great, a pretty impressive cave, worth reading information about it before you go as there isn't really any info there. But definitely worth a visit.",

          "So after a breathtaking drive up to to top on a wetish day we arrived in the car park paid our two euro to park and then headed to where we thought the beginning of the cave was....oh no it was a trek and I mean a trek i personally have trouble with my leg and it was difficult",
          "As it was my first cave, i expected a bit more from it. My GF was afraid to get down, but later on she managed :) Getting up the hill was a bit hard at the beginning, but we adapted fast. I've seen lady going up the hill pushing baby baggy. Hard to find this case, as location",
          "This is a truly unique cave! Totally worth walking to its entrance. The view from the top is also really rewarding. If you cannot make it on foot, try the donkeys. The cost is 10 Euros per ride.",

          "If you get the chance to do this then you must. A steep walk up one of two paths leads you to the entrance to this cave. You can if you wish take a donkey ride to the top but the walk is better. A huge cavern awaits with stalagmites and stalactites and the feeling of",
          "This was by far the best cave we have visited for stalagmites and stalagtites. It is a long walk up to the cave entrance and in the heat without any shade. You can go by donkey, at a price. It is well worth the effort and the route into the cave was well organised and nice",
          "The road to arrive to the cave is very good with a beautiful view to the Lasithi plateau. The cave inside is very deep and his history very interesting. All the stalactites and stalagmites create a art that only the nature during many many years and a lot of patience could be",
          "The Diktaean Cave is one of the main tourist stopping points on the circuit of the Lasithi Plateau, in part because of the formations inside and because in Greek Mythology it was where Rhea, the mother of Zeus, hid him as an infant. As with most myths and legends there are lots",
          "We sat next to some frequent Crete holiday makers on the plane and they said we absolutely must visit Dikteon Cave. I really wish we hadn't listened. The journey there is nice depending on where you're travelling from but we really didn't enjoy the cave itself. The walk up there",
          "we have visited the Dikteon Cave, with our 9,8,5 years old kids, on 22.9.2013 , it was challenging to clime the hill , but it was worth it . the view is wonderful . the cave itself is very interesting to see.",
          "After navigating from the cruise ship pier at Heraklion, it was a relief to finally arrive at this destination. Parking is scarse and chaotic, then surrounded by many restaurants. The hike up the mountainslope is challenging, but not donkey necesssary. The cave is interesting,",
          "We had visited the cave many years ago and as we were driving through Psychro village as part of our ride around Lassithi, we decided to call by. The village square is rather manic with coaches jostling with cars for a space, it's every man for himself but we found a space and",
          "It is a very steep path up to the cave. None of the tour operators tell you exactly how steep it is. Even a fit person would struggle in the 42c heat. There are bands of people - mostly men - who hassle you to have a donkey ride. Maybe 6 or 7 groups haggling to get you to get on",
          "The path to the cave is steep and tourists are offered donkey rides up there. Myself and my partner were appalled to see donkeys being forced to carry people up there in the sweltering heat. We were close to a stocky man with graying hair and beard taking a teenager on a donkey",
          "The cave is worth a visit. However I felt so sorry for the poor donkeys that had to carry people up the huge hill, I could understand children but grown ups riding the poor animal is just ridiculous. I didn't see any water provided for the donkeys, which is crazy in that heat!!!",
          "Great view all the way to the cave. Our 6 and 3 years old Kids enjoyed the trip especially the donky ride that cost 15 euro up hill and back. A bit pricy but worth it.",

          "There are two ways up to the cave from the parking lot (parking is 2.50\u20ac). One trail is a hike over boulders and loose rocks that is best not done with flip flops on. The other trail is a simpler walk on a stone path or can hire a donkey \u2026",
          "Recommended if you are looking for an alternative for a day on the beach. The view over the Lashiti plateu is worth seeing. The cave is quite small and takes a 30 min walk uphill to reach (can be done also with donkey taxi)",
          "Nice cave, just quite small. Sfendoni cave is much more interesting.",
          "Stunning views from the top of the mountain. Inside the cave is incredible, it looks like the set of an Indiana Jones movie. Well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful cave, well preserved and organised. Great escape from warm beaches.",
          "This site is a good warm-up for Knossos. Unfortunately the information is minimal. Pity! This history is awesome and some of us need a little help to get it. We walked right past the sacrificial table twice.",
          "Nice cave. Only caveat is the 15 min climb to the top. The stairway to the cave is usually wet so be careful. Overall good to view.",
          "Interesting place to visit! Don't expect something that spectacular but still worth the visit.",
          "Wow\nIt worth a visit",
          "Great place to visit with kids, a good trek up and the cave was beautiful. Would have liked some more information on various parts of the cave...but there are enough information boards there",
          "Very kind personal, spectacular view, and good food! If you're visiting the nearby cave, this should be the go to!",
          "This place is magical and one can understand why it is the mythical birtplace of Zeus. Cave is situated high in the mountain range, overlooking a fertile plateau. Inside are beautiful stalagtites which make this place feel truly mythical.",
          "Quite impressive cave. The entire thing takes maybe 1hr including the 'hike' up and down, so you might want to combine it with some other activity around there if you drive all the way from e.g. Heraklion.",
          "It costa EUR 6 and is a quick walk from the parking which is EUR 2. The cave itself is really wonderful and well exposed",
          "Mythology says that Zeus grew up here hidden from his father's eyes. However, it's not the only cave claiming this in Crete \ud83d\ude0a The cave is quite astonishing, the short hike offers two versions, one for less exercised people and one which is \u2026",
          "Birthplace of Zeus \ud83c\udf29  very beautiful cave from inside. A little cold, my recommendation   to wear something warm, especially for children",
          "Very impressive... it's a difficult walk from the car park and only people steady on their feet should attempt the cave!!! Keep tight hold of children!",
          "Nice small cave but 0 narrative of the history and mythology. 6\u20ac is extremely overrated and overpaid. There is a fee for the parking spot of 2,5\u20ac . Then you need to walk up the hill for about 800m. There are two paths. I suggest you go up \u2026",
          "Beautiful and worth the hike, even with a baby of 8 months strapped to us in the August heat. Be sure to bring water!",
          "We went from the coast to the cave. It takes lots of serpentine road. Our trip was for whole day. So it wasn't stressy and our rented  car managet it well.\nLasithi plain was mediocer (too high expectations). Yet interesting to see. Almost \u2026",
          "Impressive cave.",
          "For those who love Greek mythology, this place is a must\n\nThe the most powerful god of the ancient Greek civilization. I still remember the stories I used to read and all those movies our  family used  to watched on TV. Minotaur (mythical \u2026",
          "You need to walk 15 to 20 minutes from the parking area in order to visit the cave. Beautiful scenery and nice view. There are 2 paths to reach the cave. The left path is better and easier to walk. The entrance ticket is 6 euros/person.",
          "Quite the climb, especially if you aren't wearing good shoes or weren't necessarily planning for a climb but the view is breathtaking ans once you reach the top, all sweaty and warm, you enter the archaeological site (6 euro entrance fee for everyone over 25) and enter the coolest cave ever! Worth it!",
          "It\u2019s very beutiful place.Entrence cost 10\u20ac. You have big parking with restaurants under the hill. From the bottom to cave You need to climb for 20 min.",
          "Nice cave, smaller then expected. The walk up to the cave took longer then the tour inside the cave.",
          "The walk up is very uneven and steep so elderly or less mobile people may be better with the smoother path the donkeys use. Cave is not huge but has some very impressive stalagmites and stalactites. It's cool too so provides a break from the heat \ud83d\ude02 cafe at the bottom is open and airy and offers usual options.",
          "It\u2019s a nice way up and a cute cave. Not very big though.",
          "It's ok to visit, but for sure there are more impressie caves. Beautifull stalagmites.\nDuring Corona you need to wear a mask....",
          "Beautiful experience! Smaller then.expected though the walk up to the mountain is really doable in 15/20 minutes if you walk straight on the nice road. and if you take the walk to the right it's a rougher but prettier one. students get free entrance and adults is \u20ac6. Great experience",
          "Cool story, nice environment, great walk to the top with nice views.",
          "Fantastic cave a good way up a very steep hillside. There is two ways up,I rocky hard path which is shorter and a longer smoother path. Take the hard path if you enjoy exercise. Definitely a workout if you do it quickly haha. The cave \u2026",
          "Great for your culture and your body temperature since it's turning around 15 degrees down here",
          "Melidoni cave was more interesting and less crowded.",
          "Have good pair of shoes cause it's a bit of the walk up! and then down :) but totally worthy!\nhint-tried frozen yogurt after the cave on the top of the mountain-the best one we had so far!",
          "A unique experience! At the top of the Lassithi plateau, this is the cave where - according to the myth - Zeus was born. After walking the last bit to the entrance of the cave, take a cool walk down to the bottom, where a pristine lake greets you.",
          "Excellent food and a great view, a lovely find.",
          "The walk up was longer than the journey into the caves. They provide you with a donkey ride up if you choose.. It is very steep, wear good shoes. Long steep oaths and lots of stairs.\nI think 8\u20ac each.",
          "Stunning views. Place where you can just feel the history embracing you. Even if you don't believe in myths it's just worth to read a bit about the place. It's not a disabled friendly , long walk up, 300 stairs down and the back up the same \u2026",
          "Beautiful scenery but definitely a tourist trap! There wasn't much to see in the cave after you went in. It's about twenty mins walk to the top and the path is quite rocky. Lovely views from the top",
          "I thought about skipping it, but once I climbed that hill, going inside the Diktaean cave seemed as a must! Not sorry at all. Fabulous scene inside and a wonderful view on Lassithi Plateau below. There are two paths leading up to the top. \u2026",
          "It's a tourist trap.\n6 euros for almost nothing.\nThe climb is reasonable.\nThe cave is very small.\nIt takes you 20 minutes to go up, then the cave is over in 10.\nI've seen much nicer caves.",
          "Nice cave, save walking.",
          "Well worth the climb up the hill and into the cave itself, and is one of the best 'show caves' I've seen.\n\nAccess is from the car park at the bottom of the hill costs \u20ac2.50\n\nThere are  two paths to the top I would suggest the newer flatter \u2026",
          "We're nice place to visit if you find yourself in Lasithi Plateau. Unfortunately the cave itself is robbed of stalactites and stalagmites, but some remained, including columns and dogs curtain. Still worth the visit, highly recommended.",
          "Not big as i hoped, but nice... Must to go. From parking place you will need to go about 15-20min up to hill on a narrow track. Price 6eur per person, parking free. Working hours changing by seasons, but on october is was 8.00-18.30.",
          "Lovely place",
          "Nice place to see. There's a loooong way to walk to the cave. If you hate walking, you can take donkeys to carry you. It's up to 1000 meters altitude, so you might want to get an extra clothing just in case.",
          "Great day out.  It is quite a walk to the cave but well worth it.  Most of the walk is on a decent path.  There are donkeys to take you up but in my opinion it's cruel......make sure you take some drinks and snacks with you as the shop near \u2026",
          "Beautiful location but a though hike.\n\nThe cave is located beautifully at the top of the plateau. The hike up gives gorgeous views of the surroundings.\n\nAt the bottom there's ample opportunity to buy food and drinks. We had an amazing meal \u2026",
          "Awesome stop off on the Lasithi plateau. About a kilometre from the car park up the mountain, decent footwear recommended. Steep steps in to and out of the cave. Take the donkey path which is a lot easier going!",
          "Amazing place!\nYou should be very fit to climb up so many steps, but it's worth it.\n6\u20ac for tickets.",
          "Absolutely must-see \ud83d\udc4d",
          "U need time and stamina to hike up the rocky path to experience how Rhea as a doting mum felt to protect Zeus at all costs while bearing him. The way down by the easy path is good after the tough job. View of the plateau was a beauty too!",
          "An amusing trip going up the mountain. There are 2 routes, an easy one and an 100m shorter but more challenging route which is more on the right side. They offer donkey rides up too but we did use our own HP. The entrance fee is Ok for what \u2026",
          "Good place",
          "This cae was quite boring, worth a visit though",
          "Beautiful caves definitely worth a look, we hired quads out and drove from Malia strip, great day.",
          "I liked it. But smaller than expected.",
          "Steep path to arrive to the cave. A bit slippery once inside, so be sure to wear good shoes. Entrance fee is 6 euros.",
          "Great cave and a mini adventure for the kids climbing the semi-challenging rocky path to the entrance. The cave itself takes 10 mins or so to climb down and back up. There's a lot of steps so be prepared and definitely leave the flip-flops at home.",
          "This is pretty small, but deep cave, also you'll need to climb to it at least 10-15 mins after driving about 30-40 mins from main road so plan your time carefully. We've visited other caves but this one is definitely worth to be explored - \u2026",
          "Very pretty. The hike to the cave is not an easy one. You can rent a donkey for \u20ac10 or walk almost 900m by foot up the mountain.",
          "Cold take a Jacket with you",
          "Overrated, overpriced, overrun with tourists.\nSteep hike up the hill and then down a long flight of stairs brings you to a small loop with coloured lights shining on some stalactites and stalagmites.\nNo folder, guide or information given \u2026",
          "Nice place. Well prepared for tourists.",
          "Zeus's birth place, and if you  read Greek mythology this place must be visited and on 1025 meters above sea level a stunning view of Lassithi Plateau is going to be your reward",
          "Loved the cave. Very, very long uphill walk to get to the cave. You can pay 10 euro to get a donkey ride most (not all) of the way to the cave steps. This must be the equivalent of 30+ sets of stairs, if not more. Well worth the trip if you \u2026",
          "Nice cave, a bit of a climb to reach so better wear comfy shoes. It can get slippery in the cave too, so would advise something more solid than flip flops. The view of the valley that you have before entering the cave is really beautiful though.",
          "Interesting place to visit if you like archaeological and Greek mythology rolled into one. Once at the site there is a 15 minute walk up a fairly steep path or a ten minute scramble over rough terrain (not for the unfit) to reach the cave. \u2026",
          "Long walk to the Cave, but you can hire donkeys for 10-15 euros depending on the season. Once inside the steps are very steep but the Cave is quite impressive",
          "We visited this place in late august 2018. Tje views are awesome. The Lassithi plateau can be seen from over there. You can rent donkeys to go up. Take some clothes because there are around 12-14 degrees inside.",
          "Mass tourism at its best: the visit of this cave (small, but deep) for an entrance fee of EUR 6 per person is too expensive, as the visit is finished in about 10 minutes. Apart from that, there are far too many people as this seems to be a touristic highlight of the Lasithi Area.",
          "In my opinion, its whorting!!! Thinking its such an old cave, and well mainteined, just go and see it. Maybe not all the cave its open, but the small part open, its trully amazing!\ud83e\udde1",
          "It's a great cave, a difficult way up to the cave then you have to climb down the stairs to so the cave and climb up again. You can take 2 ways down 1 easy and one the old fashion way, so difficult",
          "It\u2019s a drive up the mountain, when you get there, there is parking and several shops and restaurants. We hiked up the easier paved path (left path is paved and right path is rocks). It\u2019s about 15min up and some parts are steep so wear good \u2026",
          "Beautiful view from the top! ;)",
          "Fantastic natural scenery.. Unable unmissable",
          "A Must see even if to get cool for a while..",
          "Great experience but a hard walk to the cave especially in heat, there are 2 paths.",
          "Big climb, 200 steps inside but worth it beautiful natural cave stalactites and stalacmites",
          "A very deep and fascinating cave that's really worth a visit. Because the stairs are steep I REALLY recommend normal shoes to stand stable. I write this, because we have seen a mother with a baby in her arms with flip flop shoes that would \u2026",
          "lovely cave I had a great time there",
          "Very interesting and traditional place to visit in Crete.",
          "Very nice scenic road from Heraklion to Psychro .Lovely little villas with lots of flowers and family owned greek taverns, on the way to the cave.The 1000 metres walk is not very hard and the cave is spectacular.Beautiful adventure.",
          "Alright place , but I\u2019m still deciding if it\u2019s worth the drive ! The cave is not super impressing , there are a million of stairs, right at the exit there is a small \u201cbar\u201d/\u201ccafe\u201d where they only take cash ! Also, they offer you rides to the \u2026",
          "Fascinating and certainly worth a visit.  Far too busy to take your time and stop for a bit to marvel though as all single file and everyone else behind gets irritated.  Cave itself great, just too touristy and that's mid September.",
          "Nice place, if werry hot you in Zeus Cave is not hod. Worm. But Zeus not found :-D",
          "Beautiful cave with huge stalactides. Hard climbing to reach the cave, because it is located on the top of mountain. Climbing takes up to 20-30min, so advise to wear the comfortable shoes. It can get slippery in the cave due to high \u2026",
          "I had an amazing experience visiting this cave. I noticed that I feel very easy to breathe cool air. Is good to visit with families good for disabled people as well as there is a donkey's they call them taxi you can ride on them for about 5 for \u20ac6 each way.",
          "Such a eerie cave with lots of myth and legend. Photos will never do it justice as you have to be there. Good lighting and well secured stairs leading way down to the bottom. The walk to the top is a bit of a walk on a spring/summer's day in the heat but so worth it.",
          "Fab place recommend it to anyone",
          "Nice place, cold inside which is perfect for hot days. Two ways up from parking place. More steep way is better up because it has very rough surface.",
          "Walk or ride a donkey up/down the 1 kilometer steep hill. The cave is quite an experience (6 \u20ac - students free) - lots of steps, not always well lit, cool but humid.\nDepending on arrival parking can/will be an issue.",
          "It's pretty cool. Doesn't take long but most of the adventure is the journey. The people trying to sell you things every step of the way kills it about 1 star for us",
          "Must see place in Crete. Be advised that to get to the cave, you have to climb up on a mountain track, so wear comfortable shoes.",
          "Beautiful! Recommend wearing trainers for the climb. Beware of slippery surface inside the cave!",
          "The cave is soo cold after the August heat. Walk up the easy way and back down the hard way. Not to be tried if you are not fit.",
          "Beautiful place, great story behind it. We took the easy way up, we had to walk for about 15minutes to get there, and then about 200 stairs to go into the cave but it is really worth it!",
          "Beautiful, literally took our breath away.",
          "Well we arrived early which was a god send(pardon the pun)because a lot of coach parties arrived later on around 12.30pm\nFrom  the main car park costing 2.50\u20ac its a 15 minute walk along a path 30/45 degree slopes in places and the becomes a \u2026",
          "Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed but will just enjoy nice walk up and down.",
          "One of the best caves i have visited good history as you can imagine people trekking this mountain many years ago.Come prepared as the steps in the cave and the walk to up it is very steep. You can ride a donkey up to the cave for a small \u2026",
          "Beware the car park, if you can get in you might struggle to get out. There is parking on road as well . A real climb up to it but well worth it... Take water",
          "WARNING: if you have any injuries or you can't walk or hike for at least 15 mnts, don't take the walk. The views are nice but the cave itself is very small and slippery. To walk through you can only use the stairs so its very difficult for \u2026",
          "Fantastic!!! Well worth the walk up and down. Hot outside but very nice and cool in the cave. A must for all!! Breathtaking views inside the cave.",
          "Nearly died reaching it. Very very very steep climb even if your fit. Slippery inside cave. Glad I did it but never again. Please only go if you are physically very fit.",
          "Would recommend visit!!! Please be prepared for approximately 1 KM up and around the hill walk to reach the top. If you can't walk that much uphill, donkey \"Taxi\" service is available on payment. DO wear sensible walking shoes please. If in Crete don't miss it!",
          "Must have on the trip list",
          "Beautiful climb up to the cave with some great views of the plateau. The experience of the cave itself felt rushed due to so many people trying to get through it and back up. Be warned, it is a steep climb up and down stairs with poor \u2026",
          "Recommended to take some extra jacket cause the temperature difference is so high during Summer. Good shoes is also recommended to walk up the stone way to cave, or you can hire a mule to go up and down way as well.",
          "Interesting cave as the legendary birth of Zeus. Quite a climb up to the cave and some great views from the top. The cave itself could do with better lights but well worth the effort to get there.",
          "Rather small cave. Pretty though, but I feel like \u20ac6 is a bit expensive",
          "Disappointing! Definetly NOT a must see place in Crete... First of all it takes some time to get here by car no matter where you're based, and the road itself is q bit  trechearous. The parking is charged 2.5\u20ac and from there you need to \u2026",
          "I don't think this cave is a must see objective, but if you are looking for an easy trip, quiet and if you want to meet locals, this can be a good choice. The kids were most excited: they ride a donkey, they liked the cave and they found \u2026",
          "If i was a feotal Zeus and my dad wanted to eat me straight out of the womb, I'd hope my mother would come here to birth me. The whole nursing by a mystical goat doesn't sound bad either.",
          "Amazing cave! Our kids were really impressed. Just be careful at the entrance, pay attention to the steps.",
          "Way to cave from Agia Galini was more exciting than place. Cave is quite small but nice i didnt like metal fence",
          "Visiting this archaeological site brought to life the mythology of Zeus.  One can't help but envision the Greek God growing up within it.  And once you learn the history behind the ancient people who came here from all over the \u2026",
          "Cant remember the price of the ticket but it wasn't too expensive. It is a bit of a walk up but nothing too strenuous. Theres a fee to park the car as well. The cave has a path to follow and stairs and is lit up. Inside the stalagmites were quite fascinating.",
          "Lovely place, but not for the unfit! A tidy hike up, although you can get a donkey. Nice souvenir shops and lovely taverna.",
          "When there yesterday with my wife. Long walk up to cave but well Worth the walk. But very upset that they use donkeys especially that they let adults ride them. There was one donkey that had two kids on its back and it was just about able to walk very sad",
          "Very nice place",
          "Nice cave",
          "The cave itself is really small. Could spend 15minutes max, if i really tried.\nNon the less, it's ok to go-to.\nThe climb itself and the view of the plateau itself once you are upstairs is really nice.",
          "The walk was steep but doable: for children the donkeys are perfect to bring you up for 10\u20ac. First donkey was there 10 am. Cave was nice",
          "Well worth a visit if you get chance... amazing photos to be taken!",
          "Very unique. Bit of a trek if you're not fit",
          "Zeus' cave is a must see. After reading reviews we weren't sure if it was worth the trip but we are really glad we went.\nThere are two paths to the cave, one short rocky and steep (10 mins~) and one long, flat and smooth (15-20 mins). We \u2026",
          "The cave is beautiful inside is pretty small but through your camera lens you can apreciate the colors better(please don't use flash). Its a sort of long walk up or u can rent a donkey, there are a few short cuts out of the thin road(sort of hiking a liltle through bushes) but I enjoyed the experience \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Went there on a trip ,the cave is stunning the walk to it from the carpark is steep so not for the faint but you can get a donkey ride there if you wish well worth the hike",
          "Superb, very much worth the walk.\nIt may be just a cave to some, but once inside it's fantastic.\nCareful on the walk down though, steps are quite steep and you need to duck a few times if you're tall.",
          "The trip to this cave was better and more interesting than the cave itself. Also you need a good Fitness to first climb up to the top of the hill on stone ways about 100 meters high. From the top you can enter the cave down by stairs also approximately 60 meters down and up again.",
          "Surprisingly large and interesting. Very cold and humid inside, but that cannot be helped.",

          "Stunning place to visit... cool and out of the sun. Take water and reasonable footwear for the steep climb to the entrance. Donkeys are available!\n\nA car park fee of 2euro 50 applies and then 6e per adult at the cave. Worth every penny.",
          "Lovely views from the ascent to the cave but the cave itself very disappointing. I recommend taking the 'rugged\" path up as think this is easier. Parking a nightmare",
          "Now I know the place where Zeus was born.",
          "Steep climb up to where the cave is which is a bit daunting. Donkeys are available if needed though. Caves are the usual fare but not really stunning. Nice to do something other than lie on a sun lounger for a while!",
          "The view from the top of the hill at the entrance to the cave is incredible. The climb up to the cave and then down to the cave is brilliant! It can become extremely competitive trying to beat your family and friends to the end.\nThe cave it \u2026",
          "The walk is super easy, please don't believe any of \"too long, very hard\". I went there with my friend who had a broken leg and had no issues. Stop whining for minor issues!",

          "IT isn't very big cave,  but the road from Malia to it is wonderfull with beautiful sights",
          "If you know your Greek mythology this is a must to say you've been. The road from the south is surfaced, winding but thankfully quiet. Parking is \u20ac2.5 however if you can find a space on the road just before the car park it's free. The walk \u2026",
          "It's alright but I've seen a lot better. I didn't like the tacky colours.",
          "1000 meters above sea level, cold- wrap up warm. Windy.. up at the mountain. You can walk up to the caves,( or ride a donkey). It's beautiful with patterns carved over millions of years of water flows..",
          "Absolutely stunning views from the top of the plateau, and the cave was really cool as well. I won't go into the history of the place, but look it up and check it out. The story makes it that much more interesting.\n\nA fellow traveller \u2026",
          "Good to see",

          "Amazing place. I've seen a few caves in my life before but it's the one of the best.",
          "Great experience! If you want adventure, this is definitely something you would like to see.",
          "The cave was well worth the visit. There is an easy path and a \"difficult\" path. Take the \"difficult\" path. It's not that hard and you'll get amazing views on the way up. There are donkey taxis also but it's just a 10 minute walk up. So don't bother taking one of those up. \u20ac6 to go in and see the cave. It's open between 08:00-20:00.",
          "Awesome trip to the top and nice view. Although didn\u2019t find the cave to be something really spectacular. But the trip on top and the view was 10 out of 10.",
          "It's really nature masterpiece. And work out \ud83e\udd2a",
          "lots of walking involved, i enjoyed the walk though. the cave was ok.",
          "Geologically interesting place, otherwise very touristy. They offer donkey rides up and down which I find disturbing considering the heat. Animal protection services should pay attention to this.",
          "A total must if you know the greek Legends of Olympus. There is a bit of a slope but hey - it's Crete - you can recover your strength at a local tavern.",
          "Totally worth it. Beautiful cave full of myths and legends.",
          "A great cave visit and not too expensive (\u20ac6 each). Bear in mind there's a 15 minute walk up to the cave from the car park and it's quite steep and uneven terrain. You can get a donkey / mule ride up if you need to though. Great drive up \u2026",
          "Got an excursion which took us to many places.. zeus cave was spectacular. Coach dropped us off near the top but had to walk the rest of the way which was quite steep but well worth it x",
          "Great place to go and very interesting. There are two ways up, a nice new path, and a very old one. Wouldn't recommend the old path on the way down as it's quite steep and if wet very slippery. The restaurants at the bottom serve decent food and not too expensive",
          "Walk itself in the cave lasts 10 minutes top. Nice cave but don't expect something magnificently huge. Terrain isnt easy to get there, 20-30min up and down from the parking lot",
          "Extremely long and steep climb to reach the cave. Took us 30 minutes up Then a long queue to buy ticket then 200 steps down to cave fighting crowds on a narrow stair. . Bus tour only gave us 1 hour 15 mins so we did not have time to see the \u2026",
          "6 euro is too much for how much you get to see. Tourist trap. Lots of small stores with aggressive salesmen. If you never have seen caves this might be worth it otherwise don't go here. 3 stars only for the view.",
          "Big, steep bloody climb to get there from the car park. U can go up with a donkey  (10\u20ac) or just stay with the shops and tavernas around the car park - which is what we did. Much less of a problem and nicer to the bones, muscles and soul!",
          "Not the most impressive cave on the island, Zeus could have done better. That being said it was interesting to visit and the ride around the plateau is really nice if you re driving.",
          "Awesome place even the car ride through the mountain area makes a great 1/2 day experience",
          "Large cave, that doesn't go very deep. In order to get to the cave, walking up a mountain for 20-30 minutes is necessary. Most of the path is paved, but the last sections aren't, so you need to bring along proper shoes. At the end of the \u2026",
          "Nice but small cave. Many steps and slippery inside, so need f\u00f6r good shoes!",
          "Cave well accessible, short hike on narrow path. Inside the cave comfy chilly :-)",
          "Great place ... great piece... a bit a hike if you dont take a donkey ride. Which i find better not take... cave is nice to see and chilling down there ... great view from the top... which there was more info about the story of zues there...",
          "Amazing colors and view",
          "I didn\u2019t go. In fact, anyone going and supporting the people who exploit and ruin this mythical place, treating donkeys like rubbish while at it, is a moron. That\u2019s my opinion. Have a nice life.",
          "Get good shooes if you want to go there. If Raining or fog choose different destination. Very slippery path. Funny thing there are lots of friendly shops around. And you can choose a donkey as a taxi. \ud83d\ude01",
          "If you come by car, keep in mind you'll have to park your car at a small plateau near the top of the hill. The climb to the cave is quite steep and is made of somewhat slippery rocks. I would not recommend wearing slippers.\n\nThe cave itself \u2026",
          "This is a great place to visit partly for the interesting drive there with wonderful views. The walk up to the cave is quite easy but donkey rides are offered by the local donkey club. These are very well cared for donkeys who recieve \u2026",
          "Nice cave with stalagmites and stalactites but it's basically just one cave/room, so less impressive than others. Be ware of the hard climb up the hill (about 800m, around 15-20 minutes), followed by the 200 steps down into the cave; and \u2026",
          "Well, we hoped to see more but it was nice journey to it \ud83d\ude02",
          "Small cave!!!! If yo have visited other big cave in Slovakia , this cave will definitely disappointed you. Firstly it is a long walk to the main entrance of cave; secondly, the price is very expensive 6euro given the fact that cave is \u2026",
          "It's a beautiful place to visit, defenitly worth the trip, however keep in mind that you need to climb about 1 km worth of steps on a not so friendly terrain, I strongly advise to wear tracking/sports shoes or you can ride a donkey all the \u2026",
          "Majestic as it can get - top spot to visit while in Heraklion/Crete.\n\nTip: Walk up the rocky unpaved to the right of the entrance and down the easy/paved trail. Donkeys are abused by their masters.",
          "After a walk in hot weather up to the cave is so cool and nice to walk around inside this place",
          "This place is mindblowing. Never seen a cave this big. Definitely worth seeing it. Parking fee is \u20ac2.50 and entrance fee is \u20ac6.00.",
          "Steep walk up to the caves, clambering over rocks near the top. 208 steps down to the caves, 208 steps up. Small caves, lots od stalactites and stalagmites, but very small. Nice and cool inside. Not suitable for anyone with mobility or balance issues.",
          "Not too special. The way there is long but beautiful. To park your car they charge 2,5\u20ac. Then there is a steep road (easy or hard one) to go up to the cave. It is a bit of a climb but anyone can do it, on their own pace. It is a 6\u20ac fee \u2026",
          "Mystic and fabulous cave. Worth all the distance that you need to do!",
          "Exciting place but a very quick tour",
          "Wonderful views. Even in October there is not cold dont listen other ppl :D",
          "Very nice place, but 3eur instead of 6 would be more relevant",
          "A very beautiful cave. A visit worth the 6 euros.",
          "Very beautiful. Nice little hike to get there. A little crowded, but not bad.",
          "Not great if you have a issue with walking otherwise an amazing experience",
          "Beautiful drive to get there. Caves were very impressive. Wear good walking shoes, its a bit of a hike to get there",
          "Little bit creepy but worth the visit.Great views outside too",
          "Cave of Zeus. Wear some good shoes for the steap way up to the entrance",
          "Quite a trek up the mountain, to stunning views of stalagmites and tites. Costing 6 euros to Enter. Nice few stalls and caf\u00e9 bars by the carpark. And if you feel too lazy to walk it, you can take a Donkey, (All very well looked after and healthy ) for 10 Euros. Nice day out.",
          "impressive",
          "Its not a long way up and down. But the way is a little slippery. Water is perfect for swimming.",
          "Beautiful cave however it takes only 15 minutes to walk inside cave.",
          "It's nice to see it but does not make huge impression",
          "Long hill climb, should have been advised.  Hot days and elderly or poor walkers need advanced warning. Nice views, too exhausted to go into cave",
          "Spectacular cave.  After walking up for about 1 km, you arrive at the huge entrance to the cave. Thus brings you to the sight of a huge cave full of stalagmites and stalactites that  are hundreds of thousands of years in the making. In the \u2026",
          "8AM - 7PM. Nice workout with a treat.",
          "A tricky walk to the top but a worthwhile experience",
          "Good caves. Two paths up to the cave one very steep and slippery both a hard walk in the sun then a lot of steps down into the cave.",
          "It's a very pretty cave although it could do with having a bit more information or even some of the stories about Zeus.\n\nThe walk up is fine if you are at all mobile and you can get a donkey ride for \u20ac10 which looked interesting.",
          "The path to the cave is very steep and rocky, bring good shoes - or pay for the donkey taxi \ud83d\ude09",
          "What will I remember? First of all - winding road to this site. Driving a small rented car I got some stress. But the views were really amazing!\n\nSecond of all - climbing to the mountain up by foot. My children were heroes - no claims \u2026",
          "They were lovely! The only disgusting thing was the abusing of the donkeys....\nWe witnessed one going up the hill with a woman on, which actually stopped in the middle of the way and starting to cry and make loud howling... It was heart \u2026",
          "A bit of a climb to get to the cave, but very serine and chasmic. Handrails provided access down flights of stairs to the bottom of the cave. Cold and slippery at times, but cool. Refreshments and a store near the entrance to the site.",
          "Impressive cave with the option of buying snacks close buy and riding up with a donkey",
          "Beautiful cave, slippery deep down worth taking shoes instead of flip flops.",
          "Nice cave, nothing special - only if you are in the area.",
          "Completely wonderful experience... as long as you can manage the climb up the mountain AND down concrete steps inside the cave to see the base area.",
          "There is a 670m walk up hill. The first part is really steap. But afterwards it's okay. Just take your time and take rests in the shadow.",
          "It was interesting to visit this place, but i would never reccomend elderly men and children to go there.",
          "Worth a visit when on Crete. The whole experience is great. One has to climb uphill for about a kilometer. Donkeys are available in case you can't climb, but inside the cave you've to be on your feet. Don't miss it.",
          "The caves are awesome, be prepared for a hot trek up the hill to get there.",
          "It's beautiful, happy to see this.",
          "It is fantastic cave I have ever visited",
          "A brilliant site to visit. You will need to walk about 1km up a switch back path to reach the cave. The path is steep but for the most part wide and level - although the terrain is rougher at the top. There are donkeys for children and \u2026",
          "Fantastic place to visit very steep climb to get up to the Cave once you have entered its a steep decent down to the bottom but remember that you have to climb the steps to the top again. It's really is worth going to visit  it's  lovely inside the cave.",
          "Spectacular. Note that the drive to the area where the cave lies is difficult. It's about 20km from Malia town with sharp turns and twists. Also, in order to reach the cave once in the immediate vicinity in Psichro village, there is  15 \u2026",
          "the walk to the cave is sporty, the cave is moderately interesting at best\nthe lunch at the bottom of the trail was great, best tzatziki yet \ud83d\ude04",
          "Amazing old cave that is well lit and has safety rails along the walk ways and steps",
          "A good hike up and wonderful views  across the plateau. There are 200ish steps down and then back up, stalagmites and stalagtights are impressive, one of the joined ones is older than the island (according to our guide!)",
          "Yes, it's a very steep walk but you will hopefully be expecting that, there are donkey rides but did not take one. The cave was small but beautiful, would recommend for geography lovers and ancient mythology lovers",
          "Great place to visit, but would not say that this is NOT A MUST VISIT PLACE in Crete. But if you interested in caves, then worth a visit. Nice and accessible. Can either walk uphill to the cave or take a donkey. Places to eat and drink near \u2026",
          "We totally loved the cave.",
          "People should really not use flash or talk...",
          "Nice place",
          "Student's free. Very nice place.",
          "Interesting historical place and beautiful nature",
          "Nice big old cave for just \u20ac6,-\n\nBe prepared to walk up the mountain to rec the cave or you could take a donkey...",
          "Amazing, thrilling, mysterious, dark and gloomy place of Zeus's childhood. The Plato outside has a nice view from the top of the mountain.",
          "Bring comfortable shoes. The view at the top is very nice. The cave is definitely unique as well, but nothing that special.",
          "Hard to climb but worths the effort. Really beautiful",
          "2 paths easy and hard leading to the cave",
          "Such an amazing place to witness",
          "A little hike with wonderful open cave.",
          "Just beautiful. Nice uphill hike via \"the shortcut\". Came down via the easy path layed out with stones. Hold on to the railing inside the cave as the floor and steps can be slippery.",
          "Lovely views, we chose the left path up which is the donkey route, well maintained but didn't realise how long and high up the cave is took about 30-45 mins to climb. Didn't like how the donkeys were treated as we saw one guy jabbing one \u2026",
          "Prepare for a long climb and take water with you. Once in the cave there's a fair descent, but totally worth it. It's not deep but huge. It's possible to climb the hill on donkey back but they're having a hard life as it is so don't. View from the top is grand!",
          "Beautiful",
          "Nice cave, worth to walk",
          "Ok GREAT cave!\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e",
          "In july it was a bit crowded also there is just a few lamps so you cant see everything. On the other hand the darkness make this place a bit different.",
          "Beautiful ... but bigger and with less people",
          "Final part of the way is steep and rocky. You can buy donkey taxi which can take you to or from the cave. After you pay an entrance fee (6 euros) there are free toilets but on some of them there is no paper. It is pretty cold in the cave so \u2026",
          "A bit of a walk but we'll worth the visit for the amazing cave formations (and cool temperatures).",
          "nothing special",
          "I've visited the area low-season during January.\nWhy?\nIt's really peaceful to stay quiet down there and just feel the beauty.\n\nHighly recommended",
          "It is overhyped, the cave is pretty small and not exceptional in any way. No signs anywhere. The best part about the trip was the breathtaking view over the plateau.\n\nIMPORTANT: ISIC student cards are not accepted. EU Students don\u2019t have to \u2026",
          "Didnt accept ISIC as a proof, we had to pay 6\u20ac each. P.S. Poor donkeys.",
          "An amazing deep cave but a long climb up to it, donkeys are available to take you up.",
          "A lot of steps, deep and wet cave. Nice rocks and views from the hill.",
          "Interesting place with nice view to valley",
          "Outstanding and fascinating. The walk up is onerous but totally worth it.",
          "The cave of Zeus was very impressive",
          "very interesting place and history",
          "For 6 \u20ac pretty lame. The way up to the cave takes more time than a walk around in the cave. Also not the safest place to walk with cheap shoes.",
          "It was a bit of a hike was the cave was cool to see.",
          "Not suitable for a push chair. Savage walk all the way up the hill. You can get a donkey ride up, (poor donkies walking all the way with no water boiling hot) :( paid \u20ac36 for us to get in for a 30 second walk around a cave absolutely crammed and slippery. Would not reccomend.",
          "Before that better visit Skotino Cave its free and much easier to enter",
          "Amazing cave. Very tiring trail bit please!!! Walk!! Is better than to contribute to the mistreatment of donkeys",
          "Excellent",
          "The orange's juice oldman says wrong way to the hill. Don't listen them and go a little bit left.",
          "Overrated and a lot broken. 6\u20ac is ok",
          "Brilliant!",
          "Beautiful and worth a visit however you definitely need to be fit and able to get up to the cave let alone down into it. Can be crowded. Not recommended if you have any mobility issues.",
          "One hell of a walk to get there and alot of steps to get down and back out of the cave but interesting none the less",
          "Fantastic experienc! A long hard walk to get to it but a donkey ride up is available",
          "It\u2019s well worth the travel and the walking to get the cave. A really great experience for people to do. The hill climb to the cave was tough, they do have donkeys to carry people up the hill. But please don\u2019t get on the donkeys if your older than 11 because you will break there poor backs.",
          "Especially of you have already seen something \"similar\", this place has NO value for money! 6 euros for a bad preserved site and poorly maintained!",
          "Beautifull",
          "Shorts but steep hike, well worth it.",
          "Like this cave.\nparking - 2.5 euro, entrance fee - 6 euro",
          "A short climb up to the entrance of the cave and then slippery steps down into the cave. Felt like I was in Skyrim.",
          "A 1 km walking trip to the cave. Except for the last 150 meters it is paved. You can rent a donkey to go up and down, but it is not a very demanding walk. After the entrance a stair brings you in the cave. Nice view. Also nice to see the surroundings when you are on the top of the mountain.",
          "Beautiful but cold",
          "It's okay, the 6 euro entree fee is questionable though. You have seen it in max 5 minutes.",
          "Worth seeing. Just at the end do not trust google maps driving and avoid driving through the fields...Take a normal road.",
          "Super.",
          "A must do.  The cave is stunning  The walk up is not insignificant but the path to the left is flat.  We went up by the more rugged right side way and down by the path. The tavern towards the bottom of the left path was excellent.",
          "Beautiful cave, definetly worth to drive here",
          "A long road to upwards then u will find zeus cave",
          "Only a good legend about this place as a mother saved her son.",
          "Not a bad stop to take in the Cave, it's nice & cool inside with some great views outside, expect to spend around 30mins here and another 30mins outside the Cave before moving on to another spot.",
          "Interesting place, but any informations inside are missing. Also bit too expensive as for such small cave.",
          "Beautiful and fabulously cool out of the sun.",
          "Beautiful view every place I stopped to rest on the way up and down. Shocked I maid it all the way. Got to see Zues's cradle at bottom of cave. Love how they put un stairs to allow access to the public. I was too busy hanging on and walking \u2026",
          "Beautiful nature and cave. Really worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful and atmospheric cave.  The walk up is challenging.  Take the easy paved route unless you are a hiker with proper shoes.  The view from the cave entrance over the plateau  is Amazing!",
          "Small but definitely worth the climb!!",
          "\ud83d\udcab",
          "Wonderfull",
          "Really interesting to walk around in.",
          "It's quite a hard and slippery climb to the entrance, but well worth the effort",
          "The way up to the cave is quite challenging but the cave itself is very good looking.\nIt costs 6\u20ac for 1 adult and free for children below 18.\n*Be careful inside the cave as it is very slippery, also shoes are recommended.",
          "Beautiful view. The cave itself less impressive.",
          "Cold, wet and amazing beautiful :)",
          "Came early in the morning and were the first and the only visitors for about an hour :) Had a great time.",
          "Small but nice.",
          "Very overated place. There are so many cheaper and less crowded caves in Crete than this one. EUR 2,50 for parking, you have to climb up the hill for about 15-20 mina to get there for a while literally in a crowd (In october!), it might be \u2026",
          "If you have to drive more than 1 hour to get here, don't come here, don't waste your time visiting a cave so small you're done in 5 minutes.",
          "Mystical place with unreal views!",
          "Beautiful 400 steps",
          "A pretty spectacular cave with stalagmites and stalagtites galore.\nIt's a nice drive up to the cave too, which is well worth it for the views.\n\nWhen you get there, there's a steep trek up to the cave entrance. There are donkeys that will \u2026",
          "It's a cave and it's quite spectacular inside. It's quite a hike up hill so if your not a healthy person, get a donkey ride. . \u20ac10 I walked it but my wife thought best to do the last couple of hundred metres by donkey.",
          "To expensive and not that much to see. 10 min walk through the cave.",
          "Good promotion otherwise nothing interesting",
          "Photos don't reflect a relalicty (is bad)",
          "A bit of a walk up from the car park but well worth it. There are a huge number of steps to get in and out of the cave.",
          "Very very long hard walk to the top... very hot. You can take a donkey ride.  Not worth it! Put on good walking shoes. The cave was just one 'hall' with no further underground routes. For such a walk to the top the cave was therefore very disappointing. 6eu entree. Make sure that you have enough water on you.",
          "Fantastic cave nice and cold",
          "High in the mountains, stunning views, lots of places to eat, couple of nice shops, the cave itself is a trek and not for those with mobility problems, cave is beautiful but a little to commercialised",
          "A long steep walk to the cave but worth it when you get up there.",
          "Scary steps down inside the cave!",
          "Ok get your walking boots on the path has plenty off donkey poo. Poor donkeys please walk",
          "Went here on part of a guided trip. Very steep walk up to the mouth of the cave. Not for those with breathing or heart problems, especially saying you're at a high altitude anyway with less oxygen. Take care when using steps inside the cave \u2026",
          "Notting to see ! A loss a ce a calories, and this is good !",

          "What a fabulous experience for the whole family. Would do it all again.",
          "Important historic site, a shame it's been so thoroughly covered in tourist tack.\n\nAvoid the popular tour given by Sparrow Travels of this cave and the Lasithi Plateau (unless your main goal is comic relief). It is truly mind-blowingly awful.",
          "The cave of Zeus is beautiful, with stunning rock forms. The journey up to the cave is somwhat arduous but there are plenty of places to stop and look out across the stunning Plateau below you. There are 2 different paths, one is steeper \u2026",
          "Probably a good experience but the online information is bad. We were there on Easter time(Saturday) but the information online told us that it's open 24/7 and it was open until 17h. This is just a rant on online information not on the place itself.",
          "The place is really small. Caves I have usually seen are much much longer and give a feeling of exploring. This was more like a cavity in the hill. Still if you want to do it, probably club it with something else nearby, like the aquarium \u2026",
          "Just a hole in the ground with a very long walk each way",
          "Nice cave but small, great ride to get there",
          "Difficult climb but very interesting",
          "Amazing history and tangable links with mythology. The cave was beautiful and was a must see in my books",
          "One of many \"Zeus cave\"s. The payment is up on the hill. Good only for a short visit, however, the view from above is amazing.",
          "It's rather small and a little disappointing. Long steep climb to the cave from the carpark but it's possible to hire a ride on the back of a donkey.",
          "a nice place to cool off on a hot summer day",
          "Incredible and stunning cave",
          "impressed by the beauty and grandeur",
          "Smaller then I imagined, but still good to visit. Only the donkeys that walk people up dont look happy at all and if you want a nice walk up the 1k steep mountain side then take the pavement walk on the left instead of the Rocky walk on the right a mistake we regretted.",

          "The area around the cave is very great with stunning views. There are donkeys which you can rent for 10\u20ac for ascending the little hill. Please dont ride a donkey here, they don't take care of them well. Also ascending the hill is a lot \u2026",
          "Bit of a hike, but we'll worth it.",
          "Okay if you haven't seen caves before",
          "I'm impressed!",
          "Very nice place. Remember to take comfortable shoes because you need to climb a bit.",
          "Very expensive for what you have to see. Very beautiful but it takes only a few minutes to see everything. Totally not worth the price (6 \u20ac) considering it's from one hour by car to get there and there is absolutely nothing else interesting around.",
          "Amazing place. Quite a hike up a steep hill, but well worth it. Spectacular views across the plateau from the top and the cave itself is awe inspiring. If you're into mythology you have to visit! The Lasithi plateau is also a great spot to see vultures. A personal highlight for me was watching three Griffon vultures soaring overhead",
          "The Dikti Cave was an important cult centre before 600 B.C. It was considered the birthplace of the well-known ancient Greek god Zeus. Although it is not fully excavated yet, it gives us a glimpse into what sacred caves were like in \u2026",
          "Walk up on the RHS less busy but more shade.",
          "A bit disappointed.  Long drive to get there,  very steep hill to climb to entrance. Lots of steps then down into what is a VERY SMALL cave, by comparison to others we have visited elsewhere.  Then the trek back again! Not worth it, unless you've never been in a cave before.",
          "Long hard walk to the entrance (wish I'd taken the donkey) but worth it.",

My husband was in the bathroom but luckily there were cameras in the restaurant so another local man that worked in the restaurant talked to them and they left me alone.",
          "We like caves a lot - and this cave is certainly not the most interesting one. It is just a (relatively) small cave with a single hall. 10-15 minutes is enough to do the tour (is not worth the price, IMHO). There are different formations, \u2026",
          "Very  interesting  nice  view",
          "We walked up which was a bit of a killer but it was worth it.",
          "Good place. Not worth for 7 euros.",
          "Although it has a quite impressive entrance 200 m above the flat areal of Lasith, the cave is pretty small. For 6 \u20ac pp one passes the cave in 10 min. But the view from the entrance is really nice. Taking the interesting travel into account, where one can see the rural area and old natives, it is worth to go to Psychra.",

          "I can't vouch for the cave itself as never made it this far.\n\nAfter paying 2.5 euros for parking we started our climb, (very steep slope, trainers advised) only to see a company offering donkey rides up the very steep hill.\n\nIf this was for \u2026",
          "The hike up to the cave is really worth a visit and the cave itself is quite impressive.",
          "Nice cave but really unfortunat that it is not taken care of enough and the lack of explanation/info. The cave of Sfendoni had much more explanations,a guide and nice light shows for a lower price.",
          "Very long step climb both to reach the cave and also inside, not a lot to see and poor lighting of the steps in the cave. Well worth taking the donkey ride up unless you are very fit",
          "I liked it. The entrance was 6 eur/adult. It was a nice experience. The parking situation is horrible around the cave. The staff are helping to find the parkplace.",

Impressive stalagmites/stalagtites but there's very little information about the formations or the mythology. Our kids enjoyed Kent's Cavern in Torquay and Dan-yr-Ogof in Wales far more.",

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "We walked a good 30 minutes most days to enjoy this beach. When the weather is calm its great for a swim its the perfect spot to get a fantasitic tan. If you go to Supermarket Beach you can hire the sunbeds, which have thick comfortable matresses and umbrellas for 6 euro for 2",
          "that is not the beach at Analipsi.There is hardly any beach and what there is is covered in rubbish and bad smells.",
          "We enjoyed swimming in the sea when it was calm and sunbathing on the beach. Yes the beach is small and could do with a tidy up but we enjoy being by the sea rather than swimming and sunbathing by the hotel pool.",
          "Loved the walks along the beach in spring months when it was very quiet. Really enjoyed sitting by church and eating lunch by sea.",

          "I was actually very optimistic about going there. However, everything is overpriced and I don't see why. The place's only advantage is that is located near Heraklion; a distance of 23' by car but nothing more. The beach bar that we sat on did not even have a shower, even though",

          "The beach area of Analipsi is huge. , but even if the beach is full you will find a small place where you could be a little away from people around you. It is not clean beach tho, and if you go swimming be extra careful with the huge rocks. The 5 star hotels there create a",
          "The beach is very rocky, with a few stretches to swim in, there are still submerged rocks near to the Tui hotel but its a good place for swimming. The bars offer sunbeds and parasols at 5 or 6 euros for 2 for all day, which is great value.",

          "Analipsis beach has firm sand which, on the occasional windy day, does not get blown onto your sun tan oiled skin leaving you looking like a sand sculpture. The warm waters of the Mediterranean sea are clear allowing you to see the mostly sandy, but sometimes rocky sea bed.",

          "Nice to visit this place. It offers some typical restaurants, shops and most of all, some local greek people.",
          "This is a beach of contrasts. From stones, to sand, to rocks and pools the beach changes every 100m or so as you walk west to east. The landscape and views are charming. There's an interesting mixture of accommodation, holiday apartments and shops along this stretch of Analipsi",
          "The sea is beautiful, clean and it is possible to find place to swim. It does not seem to be too crowded (I was there in weekdays), The sand is not pleasant to lay or to walk. Also the pavement in the street is too narrow and the light in the evening /night is not too bright.",

          "This beach is nice, little pebbly in places, but nice none the less. Along this stretch of beach there are allocated beds for the hotels based along the shoreline. When the sea is a little choppy it can be a bit of a workout trying to get in and out, but it all adds to the",

          "4 out o 7 days I couldn't even swim because of the waves. Sunbeds set costs 5 euros and it is not completely sandy in the sea.",
          "The beach has a belt of rocks in the water (along the beach) preventing safe entry; it is unpleasant and dangerous access to the water over sharp rocks hidden in the water. (Of course, this fact is hidden from you). There is no shade. Locals have usurped all good parts of the",
          "Nice beach with the choice of a rocky side or a sandy side. The rocky side is great with children as you can view the tiny fish which swim around the rocks. The sandy side is obviously great to sit on a sun lounge all day or jump in the sea for a swim!",

          "The beach is pebbly in some parts but as you walk further down the sand is lovely. The sea is perfect for swimming and very relaxing to lounge on the sun beds. The water sports at analipsi beach are also fab!",

          "I have visited the beach many times with big dreams to swim in a crystal clear water. Water is not what I thought of with many people paying with water or tanning during the day. Sadly the beach is not lit during night time. I really like the chapels overlooking the sea and very",
          "This sandy beach is clean and quiet compared to nearby Hersonissos beaches which are very crowded. Recommend the sunbeds at Tritonas (5 euro for two and a brolly with use of restaurant toilets). Snorkelling over the rocks and plants proved to be very rewarding with fish of all",
          "we walked most of analipsi front and found the beaches varied. behind the hotels were lovely sandy beaches and towards the harbour it went rocky we went in june and the sea was very warm and good for snorkeling. you may spot turtles on more remote beach areas the hotel beaches",

          "Lovely and clean beach.The sea was a bit choppy,but it was October,towards the end,so maybe it was the time of the year. Very quiet,plenty of local people walk their dogs,but never any 'mess' left on there. Fabulous for a relaxing time.",

          "Didn't bathe here but cycled through, it looked great and was on the to do list, but time ran out, (so much to do and see in Crete). You could spend a day here, lots of Taverna's and shop's.",
          "Used beach as hotel was too cosy around pools, rented 2 beds and parasol for 5 Euros which was quite good as they were fairly new. Water was too rough to go in sea eg redflag all week which strictly adhered to by lifeguards. Sand is a bit like old building site with a far amount",
          "This is a long beach and we used the Tritonas end which is quiet. It has loungers and parasols for \u20ac5 a day and the super Tritonas Taverna right by the beach. They are happy for beach users to use their toilets. The sea has a line of a stones/rocks which have to be crossed",

          "Beautiful sandy beach, but there are some rocks in the water, so you have to watch where you step. There were quite big waves and windy when we were there, but we liked it because otherwise there would be too hot:) Depends in what hotel you are, there are sunbeds and umbrellas",
          "Beach itself is average, some rocky parts and some sandy stretches. However not crowded at all so it really feels at times like you have the place to yourself. Lovely to walk along the small cliffs as well.",

          "Considering its vicinity with five star resorts, one might think this beach can be as well a place to display the latest luxury brand sundresses :) - but it's not. It's actually hardly set up at all, with modest sun chairs you can rent, a dressing hut and a lukewarm fresh water",
          "This is a cute little quiet beach, a few shops, and some bars and tavernas. I've reviewed the Taverna Stelios which is on this beach, so great food and drink can be found in this little slice of paradise that is hidden away. Great swimming, water very clear and tucked away in",

          "Water is clean and good for swimming and diving. There is a bar and a shop near by. Be sure to bring your own sun umbrella, otherwise it can be very hot in the open sun. It is best if you come to the beach around 8 in the morning.",
          "Stopped off for a quick drink during a walk, the beach was empty and the tide was coming in so we didn't stick around. Barman was pleasant. No toilet facilities and a step hill down into the beach.",

          "Nice quiet pebbly beach with clear water within walking distance of the town. It can get a bit full but doesn't feel overcrowded. There is one beach bar for drinks and ice creams. If you get a spot close to the cliff face you will be protected from the sun in the later",
          "This beach is beautiful, however it was painful for me to walk around on this beach. The stones really hurt your feet. Myself, my daughter and her friend we all got cuts on our feet and knees from going in the sea. You would be walking and there would be massive rocks under the",

          "This beach is a small shingle beach where you are able to rent parasols and sun loungers for \u20ac2 each item. The sea there is very difficult to swim in,as there are so many slippery rocks and so many people take a tumble whilst trying to walk out to swim. There are no water sports",

        "wiki": "Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7, Modern: Kr\u00edti, ['kriti], Ancient: Kr\u1e17t\u0113, [kr\u03ad\u02d0t\u03b5\u02d0]; Egyptian: \ud80c\udfa1\ud80c\udd91\ud80c\udf58\ud80c\udd71\ud80c\ude09, keftiu; Biblical Hebrew: \u05db\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u200e, caphtor; Turkish: Girit) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 88th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus and Corsica. It bounds the southern border of the Aegean sea. Crete lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland. It has an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi).\nCrete and a number of islands and islets that surround it constitute the Region of Crete (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), which is the southernmost of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece, and the fifth most populous of Greece\u2018s regions. Its capital and largest city is Heraklion, located on the north shore of the island. As of 2011, the region had a population of 623,065. The Dodecanese are located to the northeast of Crete, while the Cyclades are situated to the north, separated by the Sea of Crete. The Peloponnese is to the region's northwest.\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Crete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.\nThe island is mostly mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, Mount Ida, and the range of the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above 2000 metres in altitude and the Samaria Gorge, a World Biosphere Reserve. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own poetry and music). The Nikos Kazantzakis airport at Heraklion and the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania serve international travelers. The palace of Knossos, a Bronze Age settlement and ancient Minoan city, is also located in Heraklion.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating from the 18th century BC, where the island is referred to as Kaptara. This is repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and the Bible (Caphtor). It was known in ancient Egyptian as Keftiu or kft\u0131\u0357w, strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.The current name \"Crete\" is first attested in the 15th century BC in Mycenaean Greek texts, written in Linear B, through the words ke-re-te (*Kr\u0113tes; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0.tes], plural of \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0s]) and ke-re-si-jo (*Kr\u0113sijos; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [kr\u03ad\u02d0sios], \"Cretan\"). In Ancient Greek, the name Crete (\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7) first appears in Homer's Odyssey.In Latin, the name of the island became Creta. The original Arabic name of Crete was Iqr\u012b\u1e6di\u0161 (Arabic: \u0627\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0634\u200e < (\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), but after the Emirate of Crete's establishment of its new capital at \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642 Rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2aandaq (modern Iraklion), both the city and the island became known as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Chandax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Chandakas), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian Candia, from which were derived French Candie and English Candy or Candia. Under Ottoman rule, in Ottoman Turkish, Crete was called Girit (\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a).\n\n\n== Physical geography ==\n\nCrete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea.\n\n\n=== Island morphology ===\nThe island has an elongated shape: it spans 260 km (160 mi) from east to west, is 60 km (37 mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12 km (7.5 mi) (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi), with a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi); to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); to the south, the South Cretian Sea (Greek: \u039d\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland.\n\n\n=== Mountains and valleys ===\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:\n\nThe White Mountains or Lefka Ori 2,454 m (8,051 ft)\nThe Idi Range (Psiloritis 35.18\u00b0N 24.82\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.18; 24.82 2,456 m (8,058 ft)\nAsterousia Mountains 1,231 m (4,039 ft)\nKedros 1,777 m (5,830 ft)\nThe Dikti Mountains 2,148 m (7,047 ft)\nThripti 1,489 m (4,885 ft)These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus); and a number of gorges.\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.\n\n\n=== Gorges, rivers and lakes ===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the Samari\u00e1 Gorge, Imbros Gorge, Kourtaliotiko Gorge, Ha Gorge, Platania Gorge, the Gorge of the Dead (at Kato Zakros, Sitia) and Richtis Gorge and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in Sitia.The rivers of Crete include the Ieropotamos River, the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake Kournas and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit. Lake Voulismeni at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi. Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of Aposelemis Dam, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Surrounding islands ===\n\nA large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands includes:\n\nGramvousa (Kissamos, Chania) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\nElafonisi (Chania), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\nChrysi island (Ierapetra, Lasithi), which hosts the largest natural Lebanon cedar forest in Europe\nPaximadia island (Agia Galini, Rethymno) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\nThe Venetian fort and leper colony at Spinalonga opposite the beach and shallow waters of Elounda (Agios Nikolaos, Lasithi)\nDionysades islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of Vai in the municipality of Sitia, LasithiOff the south coast, the island of Gavdos is located 26 nautical miles (48 km) south of Hora Sfakion and is the southernmost point of Europe.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the North African, mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily Mediterranean. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\nThe south coast, including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains, falls in the North African climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, date palms bear fruit, and swallows remain year-round rather than migrate to Africa. The fertile region around Ierapetra, on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in greenhouses throughout the winter. Western Crete (Chania province) receives more rain and the soils there suffer more erosion compared to the Eastern part of Crete.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCrete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nCrete with its nearby islands form the Crete Region (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ria Kr\u00edtis, [peri\u02c8feria \u02c8kritis]), one of the 13 regions of Greece which were established in the 1987 administrative reform. Under the 2010 Kallikratis plan, the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at Heraklion and is divided into four regional units (pre-Kallikratis prefectures). From west to east these are: Chania, Rethymno, Heraklion, and Lasithi. These are further subdivided into 24 municipalities.\nThe region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, Stavros Arnaoutakis, who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.\n\n\n=== Cities ===\n\nHeraklion is the largest city and capital of Crete. Chania was the capital until 1971. The principal cities are:\n\nHeraklion (Iraklion or Candia) (151,324 inhabitants)\nChania (Hani\u00e1) (53,910 inhabitants)\nRethymno (34,300 inhabitants)\nIerapetra (23,707 inhabitants)\nAgios Nikolaos (20,679 inhabitants)\nSitia (14,338 inhabitants)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\nThe economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry. The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\nAs in many regions of Greece, viticulture and olive groves are significant; oranges, citrons and avocadoes are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as mizithra, anthotyros, and kefalotyri.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.\n\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\nThe island has three significant airports, Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion, the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania and a smaller one in Sitia. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from Athens, by ferry companies such as Minoan Lines and ANEK Lines.\n\n\n==== Road Network ====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway. In addition, a European study has been devised from European Union to promote a modern highway that will connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. According to the study the project should be include 15.7 km of section of road between the villages Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete, benefits both tourists and local people by improving the accessibility to the southern part of the island and lessen the accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete's capital city Heraklion, which provides the island's airport and principal sea port link with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes. The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.  \nThe investment falls under Greece's \"Improvement of Accessibility\" Operational Programme. The programme aims to improve the country's transport infrastructures as well as its international connections. It will therefore have a key role to play in making Greece's remote and landlocked regions more accessible and economically attractive. This Operational Programme works to link Greece's more prosperous and less developed regions, which should help to promote greater territorial cohesion.\nTotal investment for the project \"Completion of construction of the section of Ag. Varvara - Ag. Deka (Kastelli) (22+170 km to 37+900 km) of the vertical road axis Irakleio \u2013 Messara in the prefecture of Irakleio, Kriti\" is EUR 102 273 321, of which the EU's European Regional Development Fund is contributing EUR 86 932 323 from the Operational Programme \"Improvement of Accessibility\" for the 2007 to 2013 programming period. Work falls under the priority \"Road Transport \u2013 trans-European and trans-regional route network of the regions on the Convergence objective\".\n\n\n==== Railway ====\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nNewspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, South Korea, Dubai Ports World and China for the construction of a large international container port and free trade zone in southern Crete near Tympaki; the plan is to expropriate 850 ha of land. The port would handle 2 million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact. As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to approve it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.\nThere are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus: EuroAfrica Interconnector and EuroAsia Interconnector. They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece, ending energy isolation of Crete. Now Hellenic Republic covers for Crete electricity costs difference of around \u20ac300 million per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Emirate of Crete, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. After a brief period of independence (1897\u20131913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\n\n\n=== Prehistoric Crete ===\n\nIn 2002, the paleontologist Gerard Gierlinski discovered fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5,600,000 years ago.The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Settlements dating to the aceramic Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC, used cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs as well as domesticated cereals and legumes; ancient Knossos was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later Minoan) sites. Other neolithic settlements include those at Kephala, Magasa, and Trapeza.\n\n\n=== Minoan civilization ===\n\nCrete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoan (c. 2700\u20131420 BC). This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as Linear A. Early Cretan history is replete with legends such as those of King Minos, Theseus and the Minotaur, passed on orally via poets such as Homer. The volcanic eruption of Thera may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization.\n\n\n=== Mycenaean civilization ===\n\nIn 1420 BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by Michael Ventris, is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425\u20131375 BC.\n\n\n=== Archaic and Classical period ===\nAfter the Bronze Age collapse, Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the Archaic period. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The Gortyn code (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified civil law established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, Gortyn, Kydonia (Chania), Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two opposing coalitions of cities. As a result, the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (Ierapetra) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\n\nCrete was involved in the Mithridatic Wars, initially repelling an attack by Roman general Marcus Antonius Creticus in 71 BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69 BC, earning for Metellus the title \"Creticus\". Gortyn was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with Cyrenaica that was called Creta et Cyrenaica. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire. In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the Panhellenion, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period ===\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica c.\u2009297. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by Vandals in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by Slavs in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In c.\u2009732, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the Pope to that of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Andalusian Arab rule ===\n\nIn the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman, and then Eastern Roman (Byzantine) island, Crete was captured by Andalusian Muladis led by Abu Hafs, who established the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, Nikephoros Phokas' campaign completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 second period ===\n\nIn 961, Nikephoros Phokas returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon \"the Metanoeite\". The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.\nIn 1204, the Fourth Crusade seized and sacked the imperial capital of Constantinople. Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader Boniface of Montferrat in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the Republic of Venice, whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the Republic of Genoa immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.\n\n\n=== Venetian rule ===\n\nFrom 1212, during Venice's rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a Renaissance swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as The Cretan School or Post-Byzantine Art, it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter El Greco and the writers Nicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707), Georgios Kalafatis (professor) (c.\u20091652\u20131720), Andreas Musalus (c.\u20091665\u20131721) and Vitsentzos Kornaros.Under the rule of the Catholic Venetians, the city of Candia was reputed to be the best fortified city of the Eastern Mediterranean. The three main forts were located at Gramvousa, Spinalonga, and Fortezza at Rethymnon. Other fortifications include the Kazarma fortress at Sitia. In 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island. In 1574\u201377, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and Inquisitor. According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population. Marco Foscarini was the Doge of Venice during this time period.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nThe Ottomans conquered Crete in 1669, after the siege of Candia. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the Republic of Venice after the Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars, some even prospering such as the family of Simone Stratigo (c. 1733 \u2013 c. 1824) who migrated to Dalmatia from Crete in 1669. Islamic presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the Arab occupation, was cemented by the Ottoman conquest. Most Cretan Muslims were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan Greek, but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks. Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim. A number of Sufi orders were widespread throughout the island, the Bektashi order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five tekkes. Many Cretan Turks fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by Daskalogiannis, a shipowner from Sfakia who was promised support by Orlov's fleet which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the London Protocol of 1830, and soon it was yielded to Egypt by the Ottoman sultan. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the Convention of London on 3 July 1840.\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\". The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach. The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of real-estate transactions during the Ottoman rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\nThe Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869 or Great Cretan Revolution (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the Holocaust of Arkadi. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the Arkadi Monastery, which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n\n=== Cretan State 1898\u20131908 ===\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the Great Powers decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the near future.In September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, Prince George of Greece, appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898. The flag of the Cretan State was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.\n\nIn 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos \nover the question of the enosis (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the Theriso revolt, one of the leaders being Eleftherios Venizelos.\nPrince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.\nWith the break out of the First Balkan War, the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring World War II, the island was the scene of the famous Battle of Crete in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and Adolf Hitler forbade further large-scale paratroop operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the Massacre of Kondomari and the Viannos massacres. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nCrete was one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion seven years ago made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece. Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back, when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.\nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and Chania and a smaller airport in Sitia (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012) or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, Rethimno, Agios Nikolaos and Sitia.\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of Chania, the Venetian castle at Rethymno, the gorge of Samaria, the islands of Chrysi, Elafonisi, Gramvousa, Spinalonga and the Palm Beach of Vai, which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in Heraklion. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.\n\n\n=== Holiday homes and immigration ===\nCrete's mild climate attracts interest from northern Europeans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. EU citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality. A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British immigrants, followed by German, Dutch, Scandinavian and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The British immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of Chania and Rethymno and to a lesser extent in Heraklion and Lasithi.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites and museums ===\n\nThe area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of Knossos, Malia (not to be confused with the town of the same name), Petras and Phaistos, the classical site of Gortys, and the diverse archaeology of the island of Koufonisi, which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to the latter has been restricted for the last few years, so it is best to check before heading to a port).\nThere are a number of museums throughout Crete. The Heraklion Archaeological Museum displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.\n\n\n=== Harmful effects ===\nHelen Briassoulis proposed in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism that Crete is a victim of external tourist systems applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of Hercules (who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all \"harmful\" and \"venomous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the Apostle Paul, who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a natural history museum, the Natural History Museum of Crete, operating under the direction of the University of Crete and two aquariums \u2013 Aquaworld in Hersonissos and Cretaquarium in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n\n==== Prehistoric fauna ====\nDwarf elephants, dwarf hippopotamus, dwarf mammoths, dwarf deer, and giant flightless owls were native to Pleistocene Crete.\n\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nMammals of Crete include the vulnerable kri-kri, Capra aegagrus cretica that can be seen in the national park of the Samaria Gorge and on Thodorou, Dia and Agioi Pantes (islets off the north coast), the Cretan wildcat and the Cretan spiny mouse. Other terrestrial mammals include subspecies of the Cretan marten, the Cretan weasel, the Cretan badger, the long-eared hedgehog, and the edible dormouse.The Cretan shrew, a type of white-toothed shrew is considered endemic to the island of Crete because this species of shrew is unknown elsewhere. It is a relic species of the crocidura shrews of which fossils have been found that can be dated to the Pleistocene era. In the present day it can only be found in the highlands of Crete. It is considered to be the only surviving remnant of the endemic species of the Pleistocene Mediterranean islands.Bat species include: Blasius's horseshoe bat, the lesser horseshoe bat, the greater horseshoe bat, the lesser mouse-eared bat, Geoffroy's bat, the whiskered bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle, the common pipistrelle, Savi's pipistrelle, the serotine bat, the long-eared bat, Schreibers' bat and the European free-tailed bat.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Birds ====\nA large variety of birds includes eagles (can be seen in Lasithi), swallows (throughout Crete in the summer and all the year in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and common cranes (including Gavdos and Gavdopoula). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered lammergeier vulture. Bird species include: the golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, the bearded vulture or lammergeier, the griffon vulture, Eleanora's falcon, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon, European kestrel, tawny owl, little owl, hooded crow, alpine chough, red-billed chough, and the Eurasian hoopoe.\n\n\n==== Reptiles and amphibians ====\nTortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.\nReptiles include the Aegean wall lizard, Balkan green lizard, common chameleon, ocellated skink, snake-eyed skink, moorish gecko, Turkish gecko, Kotschy's gecko, spur-thighed tortoise, and the Caspian turtle.There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the leopard snake (locally known as Ochendra), the Balkan whip snake (locally called Dendrogallia), the dice snake (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal cat snake which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.Sea turtles include the green turtle and the loggerhead turtle which are both threatened species. The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.Amphibians include the European green toad, American bullfrog (introduced), European tree frog, and the Cretan marsh frog (endemic).\n\n\n==== Arthropods ====\nCrete has an unusual variety of insects. Cicadas, known locally as Tzitzikia, make a distinctive repetitive tzi tzi sound that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the swallowtail butterfly. Moth species include the hummingbird moth. There are several species of scorpion such as Euscorpius carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.\n\n\n==== Crustaceans and molluscs ====\nRiver crabs include the semi-terrestrial Potamon potamios crab. Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.\n\n\n==== Sealife ====\nApart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks at present, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Apart from the famous endangered Mediterranean monk seal, which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts whales, sperm whales, dolphins and porpoises. These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. Squid and octopus can be found along the coast and sea turtles and hammerhead sharks swim in the sea around the coast. The Cretaquarium and the Aquaworld Aquarium, are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece. They are located in Gournes and Hersonissos respectively. Examples of the local sealife can be seen there.Some of the fish that can be seen in the waters around Crete include: scorpion fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the flying gurnard.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe Minoans contributed to the deforestation of Crete. Further deforestation occurred in the 1600s \"so that no more local supplies of firewood were available\".Common wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladiolus, hyacinth, iris, poppy, cyclamen and tulip, among others. There are more than 200 different species of wild orchid on the island and this includes 14 varieties of Ophrys cretica. Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Rare herbs include the endemic Cretan dittany. and ironwort, Sideritis syriaca, known as Malotira (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1). Varieties of cactus include the edible prickly pear. Common trees on the island include the chestnut, cypress, oak, olive tree, pine, plane, and tamarisk. Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Environmentally protected areas ===\nThere are a number of environmentally protected areas. One such area is located at the island of Elafonisi on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of Vai in eastern Crete and the Dionysades (both in the municipality of Sitia, Lasithi), have diverse animal and plant life. Vai has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of Chrysi, 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of Ierapetra, has the largest naturally-grown Juniperus macrocarpa forest in Europe. Samaria Gorge is a World Biosphere Reserve and Richtis Gorge is protected for its landscape diversity.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\nCrete has a strong association with Ancient Greek Gods but is also connected with the Minoan civilisation.\nAccording to Greek Mythology, The Diktaean Cave at Mount Dikti was the birthplace of the god Zeus. The Paximadia islands were the birthplace of the goddess Artemis and the god Apollo. Their mother, the goddess Leto, was worshipped at Phaistos. The goddess Athena bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of Dia. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of Lefkai were the result of a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of Souda and Leon). Heracles, in one of his labors, took the Cretan bull to the Peloponnese. Europa and Zeus made love at Gortys and conceived the kings of Crete: Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, and Minos.\nThe labyrinth of the Palace of Knossos was the setting for the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. Icarus and Daedalus were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death King Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades, while Rhadamanthys became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCrete has its own distinctive Mantinades poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based music (typically performed with the Cretan lyra and the laouto) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the Pentozali. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.Cretan authors have made important contributions to Greek literature throughout the modern period; major names include Vikentios Kornaros, creator of the 17th-century epic romance Erotokritos (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, Nikos Kazantzakis. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the Cretan School of icon painting, which influenced El Greco and through him subsequent European painting.\nCrete is also famous for its traditional cuisine. The nutritional value of the Cretan cuisine was discovered by the American epidemiologist Ancel Keys in the 1960, being later often mentioned by epidemiologists as one of the best examples of the Mediterranean diet.Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (stivania), vr\u00e1ka breeches tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (sariki). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of masculinity.\nCretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan vendettas which persist on the island to date. Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun.

        "wiki": "Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7, Modern: Kr\u00edti, ['kriti], Ancient: Kr\u1e17t\u0113, [kr\u03ad\u02d0t\u03b5\u02d0]; Egyptian: \ud80c\udfa1\ud80c\udd91\ud80c\udf58\ud80c\udd71\ud80c\ude09, keftiu; Biblical Hebrew: \u05db\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u200e, caphtor; Turkish: Girit) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 88th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus and Corsica. It bounds the southern border of the Aegean sea. Crete lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland. It has an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi).\nCrete and a number of islands and islets that surround it constitute the Region of Crete (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), which is the southernmost of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece, and the fifth most populous of Greece\u2018s regions. Its capital and largest city is Heraklion, located on the north shore of the island. As of 2011, the region had a population of 623,065. The Dodecanese are located to the northeast of Crete, while the Cyclades are situated to the north, separated by the Sea of Crete. The Peloponnese is to the region's northwest.\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Crete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.\nThe island is mostly mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, Mount Ida, and the range of the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above 2000 metres in altitude and the Samaria Gorge, a World Biosphere Reserve. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own poetry and music). The Nikos Kazantzakis airport at Heraklion and the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania serve international travelers. The palace of Knossos, a Bronze Age settlement and ancient Minoan city, is also located in Heraklion.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating from the 18th century BC, where the island is referred to as Kaptara. This is repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and the Bible (Caphtor). It was known in ancient Egyptian as Keftiu or kft\u0131\u0357w, strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.The current name \"Crete\" is first attested in the 15th century BC in Mycenaean Greek texts, written in Linear B, through the words ke-re-te (*Kr\u0113tes; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0.tes], plural of \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0s]) and ke-re-si-jo (*Kr\u0113sijos; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [kr\u03ad\u02d0sios], \"Cretan\"). In Ancient Greek, the name Crete (\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7) first appears in Homer's Odyssey.In Latin, the name of the island became Creta. The original Arabic name of Crete was Iqr\u012b\u1e6di\u0161 (Arabic: \u0627\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0634\u200e < (\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), but after the Emirate of Crete's establishment of its new capital at \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642 Rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2aandaq (modern Iraklion), both the city and the island became known as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Chandax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Chandakas), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian Candia, from which were derived French Candie and English Candy or Candia. Under Ottoman rule, in Ottoman Turkish, Crete was called Girit (\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a).\n\n\n== Physical geography ==\n\nCrete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea.\n\n\n=== Island morphology ===\nThe island has an elongated shape: it spans 260 km (160 mi) from east to west, is 60 km (37 mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12 km (7.5 mi) (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi), with a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi); to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); to the south, the South Cretian Sea (Greek: \u039d\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland.\n\n\n=== Mountains and valleys ===\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:\n\nThe White Mountains or Lefka Ori 2,454 m (8,051 ft)\nThe Idi Range (Psiloritis 35.18\u00b0N 24.82\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.18; 24.82 2,456 m (8,058 ft)\nAsterousia Mountains 1,231 m (4,039 ft)\nKedros 1,777 m (5,830 ft)\nThe Dikti Mountains 2,148 m (7,047 ft)\nThripti 1,489 m (4,885 ft)These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus); and a number of gorges.\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.\n\n\n=== Gorges, rivers and lakes ===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the Samari\u00e1 Gorge, Imbros Gorge, Kourtaliotiko Gorge, Ha Gorge, Platania Gorge, the Gorge of the Dead (at Kato Zakros, Sitia) and Richtis Gorge and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in Sitia.The rivers of Crete include the Ieropotamos River, the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake Kournas and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit. Lake Voulismeni at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi. Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of Aposelemis Dam, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Surrounding islands ===\n\nA large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands includes:\n\nGramvousa (Kissamos, Chania) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\nElafonisi (Chania), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\nChrysi island (Ierapetra, Lasithi), which hosts the largest natural Lebanon cedar forest in Europe\nPaximadia island (Agia Galini, Rethymno) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\nThe Venetian fort and leper colony at Spinalonga opposite the beach and shallow waters of Elounda (Agios Nikolaos, Lasithi)\nDionysades islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of Vai in the municipality of Sitia, LasithiOff the south coast, the island of Gavdos is located 26 nautical miles (48 km) south of Hora Sfakion and is the southernmost point of Europe.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the North African, mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily Mediterranean. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\nThe south coast, including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains, falls in the North African climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, date palms bear fruit, and swallows remain year-round rather than migrate to Africa. The fertile region around Ierapetra, on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in greenhouses throughout the winter. Western Crete (Chania province) receives more rain and the soils there suffer more erosion compared to the Eastern part of Crete.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCrete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nCrete with its nearby islands form the Crete Region (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ria Kr\u00edtis, [peri\u02c8feria \u02c8kritis]), one of the 13 regions of Greece which were established in the 1987 administrative reform. Under the 2010 Kallikratis plan, the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at Heraklion and is divided into four regional units (pre-Kallikratis prefectures). From west to east these are: Chania, Rethymno, Heraklion, and Lasithi. These are further subdivided into 24 municipalities.\nThe region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, Stavros Arnaoutakis, who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.\n\n\n=== Cities ===\n\nHeraklion is the largest city and capital of Crete. Chania was the capital until 1971. The principal cities are:\n\nHeraklion (Iraklion or Candia) (151,324 inhabitants)\nChania (Hani\u00e1) (53,910 inhabitants)\nRethymno (34,300 inhabitants)\nIerapetra (23,707 inhabitants)\nAgios Nikolaos (20,679 inhabitants)\nSitia (14,338 inhabitants)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\nThe economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry. The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\nAs in many regions of Greece, viticulture and olive groves are significant; oranges, citrons and avocadoes are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as mizithra, anthotyros, and kefalotyri.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.\n\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\nThe island has three significant airports, Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion, the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania and a smaller one in Sitia. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from Athens, by ferry companies such as Minoan Lines and ANEK Lines.\n\n\n==== Road Network ====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway. In addition, a European study has been devised from European Union to promote a modern highway that will connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. According to the study the project should be include 15.7 km of section of road between the villages Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete, benefits both tourists and local people by improving the accessibility to the southern part of the island and lessen the accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete's capital city Heraklion, which provides the island's airport and principal sea port link with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes. The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.  \nThe investment falls under Greece's \"Improvement of Accessibility\" Operational Programme. The programme aims to improve the country's transport infrastructures as well as its international connections. It will therefore have a key role to play in making Greece's remote and landlocked regions more accessible and economically attractive. This Operational Programme works to link Greece's more prosperous and less developed regions, which should help to promote greater territorial cohesion.\nTotal investment for the project \"Completion of construction of the section of Ag. Varvara - Ag. Deka (Kastelli) (22+170 km to 37+900 km) of the vertical road axis Irakleio \u2013 Messara in the prefecture of Irakleio, Kriti\" is EUR 102 273 321, of which the EU's European Regional Development Fund is contributing EUR 86 932 323 from the Operational Programme \"Improvement of Accessibility\" for the 2007 to 2013 programming period. Work falls under the priority \"Road Transport \u2013 trans-European and trans-regional route network of the regions on the Convergence objective\".\n\n\n==== Railway ====\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nNewspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, South Korea, Dubai Ports World and China for the construction of a large international container port and free trade zone in southern Crete near Tympaki; the plan is to expropriate 850 ha of land. The port would handle 2 million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact. As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to approve it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.\nThere are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus: EuroAfrica Interconnector and EuroAsia Interconnector. They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece, ending energy isolation of Crete. Now Hellenic Republic covers for Crete electricity costs difference of around \u20ac300 million per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Emirate of Crete, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. After a brief period of independence (1897\u20131913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\n\n\n=== Prehistoric Crete ===\n\nIn 2002, the paleontologist Gerard Gierlinski discovered fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5,600,000 years ago.The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Settlements dating to the aceramic Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC, used cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs as well as domesticated cereals and legumes; ancient Knossos was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later Minoan) sites. Other neolithic settlements include those at Kephala, Magasa, and Trapeza.\n\n\n=== Minoan civilization ===\n\nCrete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoan (c. 2700\u20131420 BC). This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as Linear A. Early Cretan history is replete with legends such as those of King Minos, Theseus and the Minotaur, passed on orally via poets such as Homer. The volcanic eruption of Thera may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization.\n\n\n=== Mycenaean civilization ===\n\nIn 1420 BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by Michael Ventris, is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425\u20131375 BC.\n\n\n=== Archaic and Classical period ===\nAfter the Bronze Age collapse, Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the Archaic period. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The Gortyn code (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified civil law established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, Gortyn, Kydonia (Chania), Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two opposing coalitions of cities. As a result, the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (Ierapetra) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\n\nCrete was involved in the Mithridatic Wars, initially repelling an attack by Roman general Marcus Antonius Creticus in 71 BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69 BC, earning for Metellus the title \"Creticus\". Gortyn was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with Cyrenaica that was called Creta et Cyrenaica. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire. In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the Panhellenion, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period ===\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica c.\u2009297. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by Vandals in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by Slavs in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In c.\u2009732, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the Pope to that of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Andalusian Arab rule ===\n\nIn the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman, and then Eastern Roman (Byzantine) island, Crete was captured by Andalusian Muladis led by Abu Hafs, who established the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, Nikephoros Phokas' campaign completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 second period ===\n\nIn 961, Nikephoros Phokas returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon \"the Metanoeite\". The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.\nIn 1204, the Fourth Crusade seized and sacked the imperial capital of Constantinople. Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader Boniface of Montferrat in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the Republic of Venice, whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the Republic of Genoa immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.\n\n\n=== Venetian rule ===\n\nFrom 1212, during Venice's rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a Renaissance swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as The Cretan School or Post-Byzantine Art, it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter El Greco and the writers Nicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707), Georgios Kalafatis (professor) (c.\u20091652\u20131720), Andreas Musalus (c.\u20091665\u20131721) and Vitsentzos Kornaros.Under the rule of the Catholic Venetians, the city of Candia was reputed to be the best fortified city of the Eastern Mediterranean. The three main forts were located at Gramvousa, Spinalonga, and Fortezza at Rethymnon. Other fortifications include the Kazarma fortress at Sitia. In 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island. In 1574\u201377, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and Inquisitor. According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population. Marco Foscarini was the Doge of Venice during this time period.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nThe Ottomans conquered Crete in 1669, after the siege of Candia. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the Republic of Venice after the Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars, some even prospering such as the family of Simone Stratigo (c. 1733 \u2013 c. 1824) who migrated to Dalmatia from Crete in 1669. Islamic presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the Arab occupation, was cemented by the Ottoman conquest. Most Cretan Muslims were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan Greek, but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks. Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim. A number of Sufi orders were widespread throughout the island, the Bektashi order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five tekkes. Many Cretan Turks fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by Daskalogiannis, a shipowner from Sfakia who was promised support by Orlov's fleet which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the London Protocol of 1830, and soon it was yielded to Egypt by the Ottoman sultan. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the Convention of London on 3 July 1840.\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\". The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach. The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of real-estate transactions during the Ottoman rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\nThe Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869 or Great Cretan Revolution (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the Holocaust of Arkadi. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the Arkadi Monastery, which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n\n=== Cretan State 1898\u20131908 ===\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the Great Powers decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the near future.In September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, Prince George of Greece, appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898. The flag of the Cretan State was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.\n\nIn 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos \nover the question of the enosis (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the Theriso revolt, one of the leaders being Eleftherios Venizelos.\nPrince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.\nWith the break out of the First Balkan War, the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring World War II, the island was the scene of the famous Battle of Crete in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and Adolf Hitler forbade further large-scale paratroop operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the Massacre of Kondomari and the Viannos massacres. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nCrete was one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion seven years ago made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece. Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back, when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.\nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and Chania and a smaller airport in Sitia (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012) or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, Rethimno, Agios Nikolaos and Sitia.\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of Chania, the Venetian castle at Rethymno, the gorge of Samaria, the islands of Chrysi, Elafonisi, Gramvousa, Spinalonga and the Palm Beach of Vai, which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in Heraklion. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.\n\n\n=== Holiday homes and immigration ===\nCrete's mild climate attracts interest from northern Europeans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. EU citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality. A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British immigrants, followed by German, Dutch, Scandinavian and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The British immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of Chania and Rethymno and to a lesser extent in Heraklion and Lasithi.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites and museums ===\n\nThe area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of Knossos, Malia (not to be confused with the town of the same name), Petras and Phaistos, the classical site of Gortys, and the diverse archaeology of the island of Koufonisi, which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to the latter has been restricted for the last few years, so it is best to check before heading to a port).\nThere are a number of museums throughout Crete. The Heraklion Archaeological Museum displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.\n\n\n=== Harmful effects ===\nHelen Briassoulis proposed in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism that Crete is a victim of external tourist systems applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of Hercules (who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all \"harmful\" and \"venomous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the Apostle Paul, who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a natural history museum, the Natural History Museum of Crete, operating under the direction of the University of Crete and two aquariums \u2013 Aquaworld in Hersonissos and Cretaquarium in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n\n==== Prehistoric fauna ====\nDwarf elephants, dwarf hippopotamus, dwarf mammoths, dwarf deer, and giant flightless owls were native to Pleistocene Crete.\n\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nMammals of Crete include the vulnerable kri-kri, Capra aegagrus cretica that can be seen in the national park of the Samaria Gorge and on Thodorou, Dia and Agioi Pantes (islets off the north coast), the Cretan wildcat and the Cretan spiny mouse. Other terrestrial mammals include subspecies of the Cretan marten, the Cretan weasel, the Cretan badger, the long-eared hedgehog, and the edible dormouse.The Cretan shrew, a type of white-toothed shrew is considered endemic to the island of Crete because this species of shrew is unknown elsewhere. It is a relic species of the crocidura shrews of which fossils have been found that can be dated to the Pleistocene era. In the present day it can only be found in the highlands of Crete. It is considered to be the only surviving remnant of the endemic species of the Pleistocene Mediterranean islands.Bat species include: Blasius's horseshoe bat, the lesser horseshoe bat, the greater horseshoe bat, the lesser mouse-eared bat, Geoffroy's bat, the whiskered bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle, the common pipistrelle, Savi's pipistrelle, the serotine bat, the long-eared bat, Schreibers' bat and the European free-tailed bat.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Birds ====\nA large variety of birds includes eagles (can be seen in Lasithi), swallows (throughout Crete in the summer and all the year in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and common cranes (including Gavdos and Gavdopoula). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered lammergeier vulture. Bird species include: the golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, the bearded vulture or lammergeier, the griffon vulture, Eleanora's falcon, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon, European kestrel, tawny owl, little owl, hooded crow, alpine chough, red-billed chough, and the Eurasian hoopoe.\n\n\n==== Reptiles and amphibians ====\nTortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.\nReptiles include the Aegean wall lizard, Balkan green lizard, common chameleon, ocellated skink, snake-eyed skink, moorish gecko, Turkish gecko, Kotschy's gecko, spur-thighed tortoise, and the Caspian turtle.There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the leopard snake (locally known as Ochendra), the Balkan whip snake (locally called Dendrogallia), the dice snake (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal cat snake which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.Sea turtles include the green turtle and the loggerhead turtle which are both threatened species. The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.Amphibians include the European green toad, American bullfrog (introduced), European tree frog, and the Cretan marsh frog (endemic).\n\n\n==== Arthropods ====\nCrete has an unusual variety of insects. Cicadas, known locally as Tzitzikia, make a distinctive repetitive tzi tzi sound that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the swallowtail butterfly. Moth species include the hummingbird moth. There are several species of scorpion such as Euscorpius carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.\n\n\n==== Crustaceans and molluscs ====\nRiver crabs include the semi-terrestrial Potamon potamios crab. Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.\n\n\n==== Sealife ====\nApart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks at present, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Apart from the famous endangered Mediterranean monk seal, which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts whales, sperm whales, dolphins and porpoises. These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. Squid and octopus can be found along the coast and sea turtles and hammerhead sharks swim in the sea around the coast. The Cretaquarium and the Aquaworld Aquarium, are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece. They are located in Gournes and Hersonissos respectively. Examples of the local sealife can be seen there.Some of the fish that can be seen in the waters around Crete include: scorpion fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the flying gurnard.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe Minoans contributed to the deforestation of Crete. Further deforestation occurred in the 1600s \"so that no more local supplies of firewood were available\".Common wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladiolus, hyacinth, iris, poppy, cyclamen and tulip, among others. There are more than 200 different species of wild orchid on the island and this includes 14 varieties of Ophrys cretica. Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Rare herbs include the endemic Cretan dittany. and ironwort, Sideritis syriaca, known as Malotira (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1). Varieties of cactus include the edible prickly pear. Common trees on the island include the chestnut, cypress, oak, olive tree, pine, plane, and tamarisk. Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Environmentally protected areas ===\nThere are a number of environmentally protected areas. One such area is located at the island of Elafonisi on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of Vai in eastern Crete and the Dionysades (both in the municipality of Sitia, Lasithi), have diverse animal and plant life. Vai has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of Chrysi, 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of Ierapetra, has the largest naturally-grown Juniperus macrocarpa forest in Europe. Samaria Gorge is a World Biosphere Reserve and Richtis Gorge is protected for its landscape diversity.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\nCrete has a strong association with Ancient Greek Gods but is also connected with the Minoan civilisation.\nAccording to Greek Mythology, The Diktaean Cave at Mount Dikti was the birthplace of the god Zeus. The Paximadia islands were the birthplace of the goddess Artemis and the god Apollo. Their mother, the goddess Leto, was worshipped at Phaistos. The goddess Athena bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of Dia. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of Lefkai were the result of a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of Souda and Leon). Heracles, in one of his labors, took the Cretan bull to the Peloponnese. Europa and Zeus made love at Gortys and conceived the kings of Crete: Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, and Minos.\nThe labyrinth of the Palace of Knossos was the setting for the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. Icarus and Daedalus were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death King Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades, while Rhadamanthys became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCrete has its own distinctive Mantinades poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based music (typically performed with the Cretan lyra and the laouto) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the Pentozali. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.Cretan authors have made important contributions to Greek literature throughout the modern period; major names include Vikentios Kornaros, creator of the 17th-century epic romance Erotokritos (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, Nikos Kazantzakis. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the Cretan School of icon painting, which influenced El Greco and through him subsequent European painting.\nCrete is also famous for its traditional cuisine. The nutritional value of the Cretan cuisine was discovered by the American epidemiologist Ancel Keys in the 1960, being later often mentioned by epidemiologists as one of the best examples of the Mediterranean diet.Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (stivania), vr\u00e1ka breeches tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (sariki). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of masculinity.\nCretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan vendettas which persist on the island to date. Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun.

          "The most important thing about this review is that we had a great day out here as a family, and we would recommend it. That being said the costs inside the park are a HUGE disappointment. You pay to get in and the first thing your told is that if you complete the Minotaur maze",

          "Great day out and the escape room and trojan horse is brilliant. You do have to pay for all the activities like pottery making, archary, horse riding, go karting but its great for the kids. The maze was great too but make sure you have plently of water as it was a very hot day",

          "I wasn\u2019t sure if my kids, 11, 13 and 15, would enjoy this but it was a great morning out. They absolutely loved the maze and instead of normally arguing they all seemed to work together. My 11 year old did start to get impatient though and cheated by going under the fences! If",

          "If you are at all interested in ancient greek history, visiting this museum is a must in my opinion. It is very well labeled and the exhibits are well presented. The building and the exhibitions rooms are very modern. We had only one hour there, which was not enough, but better",
          "On just two stories near the central place in Heraklion you get to meet 2.000 years of history, with a couple of very famous pieces, a lot of important originals, in a very modern and bright architecture and with a lot of information. Even if you have only one hour of spare",
          "We visited the museum on our day at Heraklion. It\u2019s a nice set up with a lot of ancious stuff like coins, plates, jewelry, sculptures and old history I would not go there with small kids as it\u2019s more like an \u201cadult thing\u201d and you need to be interested in history But we liked",
          "Wonderful collection, a must see in Crete together with the Jnossos palace compelx site, very rich collection, prepare from history",
          "Crete is a credle of civilization. The museum offers good overview on the history of this amazing island and is definitely great addition to your visit in Heraklion.",
          "Excellent and comprehensive museum. Allow at least 2 hours to enjoy the exhibits. Covid safe,masks and no of visitorsper room closely observed. Well worth a visit",
          "Even though my husband claimed he had seen enough pottery for a long time he enjoyed the exhibits as well. This museum presents a look into 7000 years of Crete civilization and is a must to visit! We spent almost 2 hours there because so many items are worth to be looked at",
          "We were amazed at the quality and amount of exhibits on display, in this museum. Artefacts in the region of 4000 years old the designs of which almost seemed so modern...shows what we borrow and take inspiration from the past. It does feel a long walk around on a hot day but",
          "We bought the combo tickets for Knossos Palace and this museum which I would recommend anyone with an interest in archeology and history to visit. Amazing collection of items in chronological order, some of which had been made around 5000 BC (pretty mind blowing). Excellent",
          "WARNING!!! IF YOU BUY ONLINE, THEN PRINT YOUR TICKETS OUT BEFORE GOING! I purchased online a combi ticket with Knossos and hired a car. Started at Knossos and went around no problem. Was taking pictures and suddenly my phone screen went blank. I could not access anything on my",
          "A museum you can't miss! So rich collections, so many iconic master pieces, specially for those who like archeology. I suggest to make it in the afternoon, after visiting Knossos palace (and I suggest the combo ticket which is so valuable)",

          "Nothing to say apart that the collections are splendid and varied. Make sense with nearly 4000 years history. About details, do not book cut the line tickets on the tripadvisor as it is expensive and worthless. Had to call the operator to get the tickets and the desk lady",

          "This museum had good, although time consuming, COVID protocols in place. When we finally got to see the exhibitions they were very detailed and there were a lot of them. Do allow plenty of time to get round them all. We possibly made the mistake of spending too much time looking",
          "It's an archeological museum like an other at an other ancient archeological site. Please do not missunderstand: you will see exhibits, of wich you neuer thought people 6000 years ago would have used it. But we've missed anything about the usage, the traditional live, the urban",

          "Good museum with a simple layout focusing on displaying as many of the Minoan (and later) artifacts as possible. I'd say its aimed at adults, not a lot for kids to see or do. Not a lot of interpretive art or reconstruction, you are left to visit Knossos for that. In mid August",

          "If you plan to visit just one museum on Crete, choose this one! It is extremely interesting - we learned a lot about the cultures living on and forming Crete som 3-4000 years ago. There are very many finds from Knossos and other cretan cultures. Should you have the opportunity,",

          "Well over 10 centuries of super interesting Minoan cultural information. Loads of history in this place, and at 6 euros it's not a bad price either. Check it out while you're in Heraklion before you go to Knossos.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. It was easy to find and well sign posted. Security was tight but I was quite happy not dragging my bag around with me. I found the layout easy to navigate and the information easily accessible in that there were plenty of English translation",
          "There is a lot to see here but a combined ticket with Knossos (one visit each - valid three days) is extremely good value and it is worth spending time on the exhibits of particular interest rather than try and see everything",
          "Hi all, Sorry I know my title seems a bit over the top but I've been to a lot of museums and really love Heraklion archeological museum,not only have they a massive and well-preserved/revelant collection but the layout is the Best I ever saw. We've been there with a friend",

          "We visited this museum as we wanted to see the artefacts from Knossos which we had visited earlier that day. There is plenty to see and the displays have information in English which is helpful. For adults who are interested in the history of the artefacts it is a great museum,",
          "Having visited the archaeological site in the morning it was interesting to visit this museum to see so many of the artifacts found at the Palace. Would recommend having a guide to make the most of it",

          "Very good museum to see lots of ancient Crete art: lots of pots, jewels, figurines, weapons, sarcophagus, wall paintings. Very modern layout, very clean, a proper museum. Recommended to buy the tickets when doing the joint visit with Knossos palace as it is only \u20ac1 additional.",
          "We loved this museum, great explanations in English and Greek, well laid out, you walk through time as the museum rooms go from the oldest ancient artifacts to the more recent ones. It was so neat to read about and see the everything. It's amazing how advanced they were, their",
          "This was a great thing to so after spending the morning at Knossos Palace. Their collection was beautifully displayed and curated. We were sorry some of the rooms upstairs were closed. A must see when Heraklion.",
          "Whether traveling with family or not, the museums is a spectacular place to visit. Due to the high volume of the exhibits we would recommend a guided tour so you will not miss all the extraordinary details and the historical facts of the ancient history of Crete",
          "Great museum, most items are well laid out and there is interpretation. A woman goes around cleaning the glass as soon as someone has gone near an exhibit which isn't very nice for the guests to inhale all the cleaning fluid! But definitely worth a visit",
          "Great Museum, especially compared to other Greek museums. The exhibits are labeled and ordered for a nice visit",
          "Truely amazing exhibits nicely set out & shown to great effect. To think that most of the exhibits are potentially 4000 years old shows how advanced & capable the Minoan people were. When we visited there was a queue to get in & through security, but overall it was pretty easy",
          "This must be on of the best museums I have ever visited. Displays are well catalogued with information in Greek and English. Starts with prehistoric Crete and move closer to the present. Highlights are the reconstruction of Knossos, the bull head and the goddess holding snakes.",
          "We drove trough old ruins for a few days Knossos, Gortyna, Phaistos, Agia Triada, Tylissos. So on the third day from Knossos (we bought a combo ticket Knossos-Museum), we found time to visit the museum. It was so much more meaningful to look at the artefacts, because we already",
          "Walked there from the port comfortably. Cost was only EUR16 for a combination ticket including Knossos Palace. The museum is packed with exhibited items - about 15 rooms full. You could spend hours looking through the Minoan artifacts. Well documented and signed in English.",
          "I was overwhelmed by the well organized and comprehensive collection in the fairly new museum on Crete. I rivals the Greece Archaeological Museum in Athens. It is close to the City center and would suggest you plan on 2-3 hours for your visit. You won't be disappointed.",
          "This museum is spectauclarly laid out.......beginning in the late Stone Age and moving up through the age of the Minoans, and finishing in the Classical age. But it is the Minoan artifacts that are just overwhelmingly beautiful, abundant, marvelously described and laid out so",
          "I loved the exhibits in this museum - yes, the staff could learn to be more courteous and less like guards, but considering the priceless objects that they are \"guarding\" perhaps it is understandable. You have to be keen on archaeology to appreciate the finds - I went twice as",
          "Loved the museum with much art work as well as artifacts. This has been my favorite museum so far in Greece. You can purchase a dual ticket for Knossis",
          "It\u2019s one of the best museums in the world. The perfect introduction to Minoan culture. Thank You!!!!!!",
          "We went four times to finish it all. I admit that we look at everything and read it all. Well worth the time if you want to see everything. Sometimes after three or four hours I get museum overload and have to have time to process. There is so much in the museum starting",
          "Fantastic museum with some really interesting pieces. The thing that let it down was the continuous hissing and shhing from the museum attendants towards particularly small children. Even more annoying when they then spoke amongst themselves loudly. I wasn\u2019t aware you had to be",
          "As a tourist experience, Knossos is both wonderful and terrible at the same time. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have visited this museum first. It is superbly laid out (starting from the oldest to the 'newest'), with lots of explanatory material which is always",
          "This is a must see - it has all the treasures of the Knossos Palace and so much more. Beautifully laid out, lots of information. Go early because the tour buses come later and it is sometimes hard to see things or contemplate the exhibits with guides rattling on!",
          "We didn't manage to see all of the exhibits in two to three hours, the dual entry ticket with Knossos ticket is very good value at 16 euros against 10 and 15 respectively, it's valid for three days, we tried to go back to the museum after visiting Knossos and found that while",
          "Pottery, paintings, mosaics, sculptures, old metalwork (Swords, coins and such) You are not allowed to bring in any liquids that may damage anything, after a tourist sprayed a painting with perfume and damaged it. You must check in anything that is banned at the cloakroom just",
          "Fascinating collection over 2 floors of Minoan history and artifacts. Fully refurbished exhibition halls and excellent display cabinets. Great supporting detail. If you visit Knossos you need to visit the museum. Well worth it.",
          "We went to the museum on the first day of our visit before going to the Knossos archeological site. Unlike Knossos, which was quite disappointimg with its deceiving restoration works, the Archeological museum was great. It gives precise historical background of the Minoan and",
          "There is a great vast amount of artifacts at this museum. She much is unknown about the minoan people that thrived at this location more than 3,600 years ago. It\u2019s amazing how advanced the people were and what they had accomplished. Anyone that goes to Crete must visit this",
          "Spent 1.5 hours in the. Museum, a stunning collection, visit before you go to Knossos. Some of the artefacts take your breath away, clean toilets and a good museum shop.",
          "Nice museum with a great collection in out and indoor displays. Tells a lot about Crete's history. We had a Nice day.",
          "Not 100%sure about restorations but glad it is there so you get a feel of the magnificance of a palace that is 3600 years old. Do go at 8 sharp to avoid the cruise ship tour buses..or maybe later in the day. We got there at 9 and too many tours. Anyways site is large so you can",
          "Many of the important Cretan relics are at this museum. The layout is logical, but the text on the walls are too small, or, worse yet, partially missing. Overall, it is a must-see if you wish to understand Crete\u2019s history",
          "Thus helped get rid the bitter experience if the concrete Knossos. The layout and variety of exhibits was brilliant. The intuitive and spacious layout made navigation easy.",
          "2nd best in Greece, after the Archeological Museum of Athens. Far more interesting than the Acropolis Museum of Athens. You don't even need a guide to visit. All you have to do is to read the explanation of the exhibits.",
          "The museum is in the centre of Heraklion. It\u2019s treasures are beautifully displayed and the layout is explained very well. We spent a fascinating 3 hours there.",
          "Went in arround 10 am. ..... Just so much to see from the earliest times of Greek and especially the Minoan civilisations for anybody with any interest in history and/or archaeology ..... surprised to find had been in there for nearly FOUR hours ....... I think that says it",
          "Having visited many of the Minoan archaeological sites around Crete which point out that all the artefacts discovered are stored at this museum, it was time to put everything together and see the discoveries. Not a necessity, but seeing one site probably helps make sense of the",
          "The richest, in exhibits, archaeological museum in the world for the greatest known civilisation that has ever existed on earth.",
          "An absolute must. We spent 3 hrs. Late afternoon till closing. Very close to our hotel, infinity boutique hotel. Amazing after going to knosses that morning. Seeing artifacts 4000BC.",
          "All of the major archeological finds from the palace of Knossos are housed in this museum. The Minoan civilization was extraordinary and the presentation of the pieces in this museum will convince you how extraordinary they were.",
          "A great place to see artifacts from history many of which have not been officially catalogued. A cool and spacious area to wander around and pass the time. Fascinating stories in every room . Just go,stroll round and enjoy the experience",
          "Recommended. The museum can be visited via an extra euro add on from a Knossos trip so good value. Lots of pots and jewelry and the famous Pareus disk.",
          "The Museum is well worth seeing. The collection exposed is beautiful and interesting also for an amateur. The posters in English explains the artefacts in an understandable way and adds meat to the bones when you visit the Palace in Knossos. If you are planning for your end",
          "We purchased a joint Knossos and archeological museum ticket so we didn\u2019t have to queue to buy one. We did have to queue to have our bags scanned, which was a bit frustrating (one scanner and LOTS of people waiting). Once inside there is a cloakroom if you don\u2019t want to carry",
          "The displays are arranged chronologically by room. This really helps in getting clearer picture of the ancient history of the island. Besides the famous artifacts like the Phaestos Disk I liked the wooden reconstruction of the Palace of Knossos. At the actual site I had a hard",
          "This is a one of the best little museums I've visited. I was entranced by the selection of pottery, small seals,statuary and other relics in this museum. I found it well curated, with good English descriptions. If you are interested in all the minutiae of ancient Minoan life,",
          "The Archaeological Museum of Heraklion is a must see in Crete . The volume of visitors inside the museum further confirms the huge interest in the Minoan art and culture this museum has on display . 1-3 hours are needed if you really want to see all the exhibits especially when",
          "It was hard to get the age of all these remarkable treasures fixed in ones head. They are SO old! What an extraordinary collection of artifacts in amazingly good condition. i am not a great one for dusty museums, but this one was mind-blowingly spectacular! The gold jewelry was",
          "Despite crowds from cruise boats, the visit went smoothly. The collection is astonishing, and beautifully curated. The building is impressive, and leads you through ancient history with clear and helpfulmexplanations. A great museum.",
          "This place contains everything of value that has been excavated in the island in the last two hundred years. Very well presented.",
          "It's nice to get inside from the heat... But it's nice and lot of Greek history. And if you are lucky you will see maybe 1 or 2 vases. It's good place to go to, and worth it",
          "We visited the museum after a visit to the Palace of Knossos with a little trepidation as we were disappointed with the Palace ruins and information about the history of the site. In my opinion a visit to the museum should be before the Palace of Knossos to fully understand this",
          "After a visit to Knossos Palace this museum is a must where all the details of the Minoan civilization come alive. See art, jewelry, pottery, religious artifacts and burial coffins. Amazing stuff from an ancient civilization. The museum is not large and you can complete a visit",
          "Wonderful collection of Minoan material, very well displayed and with a lot of explanatory English text. Fascinating pottery, implements and tools, stunning jewellery. Absolutely well worth seeing; we certainly learned a lot. An enormous amount to see - two visits would be great",
          "Too much See twice on several days is a good option Amazing Amazing Amazing Need to see it\u2019s the root of European no WORLD civilization! The museum has stuff from more before Christ then 2019 years.... Really excellent Value of entrance is 10\u20ac but free last weekend of",
          "You can see there many things. Great who intrested at history. Also good for kids, there are some entertainment for them. Minuses that some things are not working and the price is 7,5e",
          "Nice and inexpensive during the off season. No crowds and exhibition s show well. Very informative, too.",
          "It's a museum....what else do I say. Contains some of the artifacts from Knossos (plus lots of other stuff), and provides history of the area. I believe there was a discount if you bought a combined ticket for the archaeological site. Public bus to the site leaves from just",
          "You should of course visit the archeological site of Knossos, but to understand and get the context: This museum is fantastic. Beautiful and intrigueing objects, a lot to learn. If I had to choose between this and seeing the Palace of Knossos: My first priority would defnitely",
          "Excellent museum. Not too long to visit, but the exhibits are all worth the time to see. Try to arrive early before the large tour groups. 1100 should do it.",
          "The Heraklion Archeological Museum was one of the most pleasant surprises of our visit to Crete. The museum is beautiful, well designed, well laid out, and has an amazing collection of Minoan artifacts. All the displays had full descriptions in both Greek and English. Also, the",
          "Bought as part of the Knossos ticket,this museum houses artifacts found at Knossos and other sites across the island. Well worth a visit if your a history buff.",
          "Well organized and informative. Only complaint is there is so much at some point I did not want to see another pot or sculpture.",
          "Great collection of Minoan piece of arts. The visit us definitely complementary to Knossos palace since most of pieces found there are displayed herr! Also good coverage of Greek Roman and bizantine history",
          "Absolute 5 stars on a Saturday if you kick it off before 0830. We spent three hours and could have easily spent longer. So much to see, and very well laid out and informative ... then the bus loads of cruise-ship tourists arrive, clearly on pack-it-all-in timelines in guided",
          "This is in the heart of Heraklion so combine it with visiting the town centre. The museum is a modern facility with plenty of space to see the huge number of exhibits from through the ages. It\u2019s the only place to see the original wall frescoes from Knossos too. You get a very",
          "Incredibly informative displays and clearly treasured and precious; beautiful artefacts of interest and provide quite amazing insight into the civilisation - if it\u2019s a guided tour, be careful that it\u2019s not rushed as there is so much to see and you are in danger of \u2018skipping\u2019",
          "Our guide escorted us around the museum pointing out the most interesting exhibits. The frescoes were amazing as was the pottery.",
          "There can\u2019t be many places that cover the consequences and artefacts of such a long period of human history, or of so many different epochs and cultures. This museum really is everything you might expect and more and, whether or not you also make a parallel visit to Knossos or",
          "Excellent museum. Great place to discover the Minoan civilization. Fascinating place! Have at least 2 hours to see the place. You can buy the tickets of Knoss",
          "We only decided to go to this museum at the last minute and were really glad that we did not miss it. The exhibits are beautifully displayed, well explained and in fact the whole museum is a bit of a work of art in itself. We loved it.",
          "Small so easy to get around. Interesting exhibits. What we expected. Walked straight past it, whilst trying to find it.",
          "It is really worth to get the combined ticket for Knossos Palace and this museum for 1\u20ac extra, instead of the 10\u20ac you would pay to visit it. Around 1.5, 2h is enough for a visit. Well organized museum with an excellent collection.",
          "We spent the whole afternoon here as there was so much to see, with incredible artefacts and displays. It stays open until 8pm so there is time to do both Knossos Palace and the museum on the same day - although the joint ticket is valid for 3 days so you don\u2019t have to see them",
          "The main reason I came to Heraklion was to visit this museum. The building is nothing much, the cafe was closed, the gift shop is boring BUT the collection is incredible. Took me 4 hours as it was just so interesting. Guides you along the timeline of the civilisations and how",
          "Once you have seen the semi-reconstructed palace, you need to see the actual artifacts that were used as the basis for the reconstruction. I saw many artifacts that I have seen pictures of in textbooks and articles. The museum is not large and covers the Minoan civilization",
          "I visited this museum as part of the Knossos palace tour and our guide, Suki, was brilliant. Definitely recommended",
          "We visited the museum and it\u2019s not very big, however had very ancient and interesting artifacts. They are open until 8pm.",
          "I've been to many museums all over Europe, and this would easily be in my list of must sees. It is a treasure trove of finds from Knossos and other sites. The preservation of some artefacts is extraordinary, beautiful statues that pre-date almost all other finds outside of",
          "Amazing treasures from the Minoan Palace at Knossos are displayed in this museum . Beautiful ceramics ! One of the centerpiece is a Minoan athelet jumping over a raging bull , really fascinating ! Well worth a visit !",
          "The Minoan collection of artifacts is stunning and huge. A must see in Heraklion. Highlights: the miniature of Knossos Palace, the disk, the original frescoes . . . how many octopi can you count?",
          "We enjoyed this museum very much and learned so much about the Minoans. There are excellent signs in English. It\u2019s not huge to overwhelm either, just the right size. We went to the Knossos palace afterwards and wish we\u2019d skipped that and just visited the museum instead. The",
          "After taking a tour through the ruins, the tourist guide recommend to visit the museum. The museum have a lot of great argueologies exposition. Is a great place to complement your visit at the ruins. With the same ticked, you visit both places",
          "Visited on a Tui tour with a local guide who will pick out the highlights. Lots to see but a couple of hours will suffice unless you're really into archaeology. A lot of unusual artefacts such as jewellery, everyday ancient objects and coffin/bath tubs (you'll find out!!).",
          "Give yourself at least an hour to explore the collections in this museum, which originate from Knossos and other Minoan settlements. If you\u2019ve already visited Knossos, the wooden model depicting how the palace would have looked like during its heyday will be of particular",
          "We have already been to Knossos before but didn't get the chance to visit the museum. This time around we paid one euro extra at knossos for admission to the museum, and it was one will spent. We spent the whole day there and didn't leave until late. The museum is very well",
          "There are some intresting pices on display here but there are alos LOTS of diffrent types of jugs and storage containerd so it become a bit dull after a while. And the staff is always on edge , sure it is understandabel but it still makes you feel uncomfortable to have the",
          "A good way to learn more about the time before the Greeks and Romans. Because I didn\u2019t know much about this it was surely interesting. Also nice arranged everything and clear presentation. A bit too much emphasis on the 15th - 13th century BC though.",
          "After visiting the palace we stop and used our ticket again for the museum. I am personally not into museums, but I enjoyed the model of the palace and the mystery coin display.",
          "If you are on Crete this is must see. My family visited Minoan Night Experience, then Knossos palace and after Heraklion Archaeological Museum. It is all connected. And those old artifacts adds to the mosaic of deep cultural understanding of ancient civilization. Minoans were",
          "It\u2019s a relatively compact museum stuffed with archaeological treasures, mainly from Minoan time. Incredible collection. You can zoom through fast or take your time. There are lots of large groups coming through which could slow down The museum book store has a pour collection",
          "Excellent museum! It provides great historical lessons and context for the items on display and lays them out in such a way that you can walk through history and see the progression of technology from the early Bronze Age up to the early Iron Age. Interesting historical",
          "We went here directly after seeing the palace of Knossos. IT was amazing to see all of the original finds from there. So well presented and very informative also. Very nice extension to the guide tour from Knossos.",
          "Wow, what a great museum, really didn't expect to enjoy it as much, but I did! Fantastic display, well labelled and organised and certainly very well staffed. The only thing is that the staff seemed a bit over the top in terms of their extremely strict attitude if anyone even",
          "If you choose to visit Knossos, it is definitively worth combining the visit to the ruins with this museum, which actually displays the original works of arts, including frescoes, which were collected from Knossos archaeological site. It is just amazing to see what works of art",
          "The exhibits are excellent and laid out well (in date order so you can see the development over time), but the descriptions on the walls alongside (only in Greek or English) have lost some of the letters/words and are quite hard to read, even for a native English speaker - no",
          "Go and visit! Don't think about it. This will tell you so much about the civilizations in Crete and their lives.",
          "Really interesting museum. Really worth a visit. Due to government cuts and a lack of staff we were not allowed to view the mosaics which was really disappointing.",
          "Good artifacts. Small museum. Well organized. Actually preferred to the museum in Athens. Try and visit the archeological sites in the cool if the day. It's quite a trek and then come relax in the cool of museum.",
          "I was very impressed by the way the museum is organised. All labelled in Greek and English. The frescos and sculptures are well displayed. However, I got a bit overdosed on the pottery.",
          "This museum is fantastic. It's home to the most incredible collection of Minoan art and artifacts and is absolutely worth visiting. Highly recommended!!",
          "The museum has 10 of thousands of archeological artefacts. There was no audio guide and it was this difficult to enjoy or assimilate this historic treasure trove - great shame. The curators in attendance were not very helpful - additional statues with no purpose\ud83e\udd13The phaitos",
          "Big history and monuments. Love to have that experience in crete ,athens and santorini . Greece has so many interesting historical museums to enjoy . Do it",
          "decided last minute to go to the museum - glad we did. Kids enjoyed and learned so much about the culture. the museum is very clean, knowledgeable information being provided for Greek history. Definitely worth to go!",
          "Wonderful experience, we didn\u2019t realise the extensive history of Crete and in particular the beautiful collection of Minoan Art and its historical significance!",
          "A true walk back through the history of the island and it\u2019s inhabitants, take your time, check all the cases and you will get the full experience",
          "There are so many amazing artefacts! You cannot miss this museum if one visits Heraklion.The beauty of this city does not mean only beaches,sightseeings but also its stunning history that makes it unique!",
          "Me and my boyfriend had a plan to visit the museum but the staff doesn\u2019t take isic ID for a student discounts. Very disappointed.",
          "Everything that is Minoan is here. Its lovely to see a museum with 100% local artifacts but also all the important local artifacts. Good interpretation boards.",
          "This museum is world class with an amazing selection and big amount of pieces. Very impressive selection, and you can easily use 2-3 hours here, navies it is so well labeled. If you have small children keep an extra eye on them since several objects are in reach of",
          "Crete is said to be the birthplace of Europe. After seeing the incredible finds from Knossos I can understand why. If you have any interest in the history of Greece, this museum is a must-see combined with Temple Knossos. The museum helped place into context what we had just",
          "If you have any interest in the history of Greece, this museum is a must-see. In addition to offering a wealth of well explicated artifacts, it\u2019s also very comfortable and easy to navigate. It houses many of the original artifacts from the Knossos Palace, so it\u2019s advisable to",
          "The museum helped place into context what we had just seen in Knossos. Everything was well labeled in English as well as Greek. The exhibits were in a very logical order that allowed us to follow the timeline of what happened in Crete over many centuries. Well worth spending the",
          "This made a good precursor to Knossos. Good to do after lunch as it's air conditioned and indoors! Also the queue here is much shorter than it so buy the combined ticket here to skip the queue at Knossos. With kids, don't expect to spend any more than an hour though. It's a",

          "Interior is modern and each room had wonderful didactic panels in English and in Greek. Beautiful exhibition of 2 and 3rd century sculpture. Fascinating to see the objects from the palatial and post palatial eras. Nice model of Palace of Knossos miniature in wood. Not super",
          "This is some big stuff. It\u2019s old as anything and there\u2019s a whole load of it. Minoans, man. Minotaur bull heads, double headed axes. Some of the best collection of old things you could ever want to see really. If you don\u2019t like looking at old things, then maybe you can just go",
          "Crete is said to be the birthplace of Europe. After seeing the incredible finds from Knossos I can understand why. A beautiful museum with breathtaking displays.",
          "Best to combine with a visit to Knossos as this gives you all the context that simply visiting the site may not give you. Great collection which clearly lays out life in Minoan Crete. However, you may be \u2018potted out\u2019 by the end.",
          "Everything that was excavated in Knossos is displayed in this museum. The layout of this museum is perfect as you go from room to room. Good for history and museum lovers.",
          "The sculpture room on the lower floor is wonderful and full of history and interesting information. For those who enjoy old pottery and tools/jewelry, the other lower rooms are nice as well. The upstairs had the original frescos, which are mostly small pieces and re-drawn to",

          "What an incredible experience to see artifacts from as old as 6000 BCE. This is the best collection of Minoan treasures anywhere in the world, some of them so beautiful you just can't stop staring in wonderment. The top floor has the frescoes from Knossos which are wonderful to",
          "We saved money by buying a combination ticket for this museum & the Palace of Knossos. If you're interested in history & archaeology, both are \"must see\" for anyone visiting Crete. The museum has a comprehensive collection of artifacts from the Minoan civilization with detailed",

But sadly the reviewer was spot on - room after room of pottery and pots. And quite a lot of",

          "I visited the Heraklion Archeological Museum the first time several years ago when it was housed in a small buiding. You would go in through one gallery and exit through the other. The exhibition only included a few sample pieces and, of course, the most outstanding ones, like",
          "So much to learn about Minoan civilization, very informative staff and such a lovely exhibition. A visit every visitor ought to pop.",
          "A really good museum. There are security checks on arrival, sun creams etc can be stored in the free locker areas ( once you have entered). Phones aren\u2019t permitted and there are reduced photo opportunities dependent on the display. An absolutely fascinating look into the the",
          "Interesting and beautiful. Presented in ways so the children can actually follow and understand. Loved the fresco-part of the exhibition.",
          "Don't get me wrong this is a fabulous place if your interested in history of Crete especially the fabled Minoans. However I discovered I was not so found this a bit of a bore, the wide on the other hand was in her element",
          "There are many archaeological finds including jewelery, vases, tools, weapons, statues and much more from the Minoan times!!!",
          "The museum, re-opened in 2014 after an extensive renovation, houses objects from the Palace of Knossos; as such, the museum is an integral part in the experience of being introduced to the Minoan Civilization. Remember to purchase a combined ticket which allows one to visit both",
          "A lot of beautiful treasures an cultural, artistical artefacts. For all history lovers a must do. And go as well to the knossos palace.",
          "I really loved Herakleio, which, although it is a big city, it is a very civilized one, much better than many Greek cities. I loved Knossos, I loved the great Archaelogical Museum, which is one of the best in Greece. The people that have worked on it know very well about",
          "We bought the combined ticket with the palace ruins. There was so much information and so much to see. Would definitely recommend.",
          "A mysterious culture comes alive at Helaklion Archaeolgical Museum. More than 6.000 artefacts arranged in chronological order such as statues, frescoes, mosaics,coins, jewerly, inscriptions, sarcophagi and sculptures. Visitors and scientists are impressed with Phaistos Disk",

          "Nice small (air-conditioned) Museum which shows a lot of local objects, mainly connected with Knossos. Also comes in a Knossos Palace and Museum Package Deal for only 1 Euro more. Information is mainly only available in greek and english and the employees are extremly rude",
          "Nice to see The Phaistos Disc at last And the pendant with bees on - discovered in Malia..... made several thousand years before it became the resort it is now.",
          "The experts consider the Heraklion Archeological Museum as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide ; \"it contains the most notable and complete collection of artefacts of the Minoan civilization of Crete\". What more can I, a mere mortal, add ?! Visit, learn and be",
          "We went here straight from visiting Knossos so that we could see artifacts that were found at the site. Lovely and cool too after a morning in the heat.",
          "It is amazing what people accomplished thousands of years ago! Beautiful museum, very well done. Worth the time!",
          "The museum is great and it had so many exhibits from the actual palace in Knossoss. Easy to get to, with lots to see. Just be aware that you are getting told off every time you go near the open exhibits, even adults! Some staff are lovely and some very uptight! Shame, as",
          "We visited this museum before going on to Knossos Palace. You could do it the other way around but we wanted the knowledge before seeing the ruins . You can get a double ticket that covers both for 16\u20ac each The bus to Knossos is opposite bus number 2 ...but ticket before from",
          "I have been is many archeological museum around world. This is small and avrage museum that you can visit if you are tired of swimming and laying on the beach. Children's up to 17 have free entrance and you can combine the visit with shopping and good lunch at Irakilion. I will",
          "This is a well presented museum. Even the broken pieces and statues are presented beautifully. Alot of history under one roof. After passing security theres a nice garden to sit in before entering the museum",
          "Well worth the wait, set up in rooms in order of visit so you don't miss anything, 2nd floor is amazing too.",
          "At first it seemed like a long line to get in and then we realized it was the security search. This is a well laid out, well documented collection of archaeological finds. Visit every room and enjoy",
          "It's the Cnossos perfect complement. After o before visiting the Knossos ruins you must come here. You can find the most important frescos of the minoic culture and pottery and bronze works aswell.",
          "Lots to see. Some amazing statues and artifacts. There is a coffin from 3000 - 2600 BC which was the oldest item I saw but there were many more. Under 18 yr olds are free.",
          "It is amazing to see the level of sophistication the Minoan people had. The level of workmanship on jewelry, utensils, development of even small objects like tweezers, is incredible. A lot of mystery surrounds the Minoans, especially their disappearance from Crete. However,",
          "A great day visiting the Archeological museum, definitely recommend a visit to anyone going to Crete. A very well laid out museum with lots of artefacts and a great sense of Crete\u2019s development through the ages.",
          "Don\u2019t hesitate, go to this brilliant museum. You will be astonished by the sheer scale of the achievements of the first inhabitants in Crete. Do much to take in, go again!",
          "Arranged chronologically, which is very helpful for someone who is not an expert. A massive collection, with clear signage. Not too busy. I recommend a guided tour though, as the sheer volume of evidence can be overwhelming. You can easily spend 2 full days here. I did.",
          "The museum has a nice collection and you can read and learn about the history of Greece, specially Crete. But I think is very small.",
          "A wonderful museum. Certainly popular with all tourists. It has such well written descriptions in English and Greek and other languages available on pamphlets. It is the place to see artefacts from the whole history of Greece especially Crete. A nicely sized museum so that you",
          "Bought the package at Knossos (1\u20ac extra for the museum) and it was great. Good complementary museum to the palace itself since it houses some of the pieces removed from there. Careful about parking around the museum, the wardens are very motivated.",
          "Awesome place with very nice exhibits. Must do. Takes a while if you want to see it all. 3.5 - 4 hours.",
          "This is worth making time to visit to help appreciate the complex and rich history of this island. Our guide was excellent and signage is also good and in english.",
          "So many interesting artefacts from the neolithic especially from the Knossos site and other minoan sites. Simply unique and very well structured. One should start from neolithic and the Roman period",

          "Great way to learn about not just the origins of Crete, but of humankind! Amazing number of artifacts from thousands of years ago, all in incredible condition. A great introduction to Crete and a prelude to a visit to Knossos.",

          "The museum is in the center of Heraklion across the street from the Astoria Hotel. We spent several hours there looking at the ancient sculptures, pottery, coffins and jewelry. We thought it was more interesting than the Acropolis Museum in Athens.",
          "The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is an excellent collection of antiquities. Interestingly set up by themes with great explanations of the works and culture. You can get a combo ticket with Knossos. Parking is available in the nearby area.",
          "This museum was a real highlight of our holiday in Crete. There's so much on show and plenty space and light to enjoy it. Amazing to see the real Phaistos Disk and artifacts from Knossos right infront of us! If you are in Heraklion don't miss it.",
          "Fun to see the history. A lot of people though and the line in was long. Nice and cold inside. A lot of things to see",
          "In the heart of Heraklion, across from Astoria square, is a small museum that has treasures from a civilization older than that of Ancient Greece. Here you will find artifacts as old as 7000 years from the early Minoan period, and before. This is a museum which has the great",
          "The museum is a very good walk into the history B.C. it is very well set, splitting into 3 sections of Art, Artefact and sculptures. A very cheap entry tickets. A combination ticket for the museum and Knossos Palace for \u20ac16, youngsters under 16 go free and the retired people",
          "If you consider to visit the ruins of Knossos palace you should visit the museum too. It takes 2 hours to see it all exploring and the development of the Minoan culture in Crete. Some examples of their achievements you find there are really astonishing if you consider that it",
          "A very interesting museum, with a very beutiful exhibition. I missed more information in english. Take the tour in conection with a tour on Knosos.",
          "Money spent well, with a guide. Gave us plenty information about the ancient history and Knossos. Lovely staff who is always helpful when traveling with kids.",
          "This museum has an abundance of treasure to see. Loads of well preserved goodies to admirer. The kids (4 and 8) really enjoyed it but the museum staff didn\u2019t really like their enthusiasm. We were told to be quiet a couple of times, which was annoying as everyone else was",
          "Would highly recommend visiting Heraklion Archaeological Museum before visiting Knossos. You will see not only many artifacts from Knossos but also a miniature reconstruction that will give you an idea of exactly how Knossos looked originally. Either take a good, detailed",
          "I loved this museum and would suggest that you go there before you visit Knossos and would suggest that if its an either or decision, go for the museum. So much to see and what really came home to me was the creativity of the Minoans.",
          "Visited here and went just after opening time before the tours start for a calm visit round the museum. It\u2019s on 2 levels, with a lift if required, and fascinating looking at all the exhibits, some of which date back to about 4,000 years ago. It takes you through different",
          "Most of the exhibits are Minoan. I got a much clearer picture of how advanced and impressive the Minoans were from the museum visit than I did from the Knossos site itself. The highlights were a bull with intact golden horns and a statuette of the snake goddess that was revered",
          "This museum holds many amazing finds of the Minoan culture that was in many aspects the start of all of western civilisation. Of course there are also more recent artifacts. It's very straightforward to navigate. Some parts of the museum were closed off due to reconstruction,",
          "Went into the museum perhaps at the wrong time as a couple of coaches had just arrived, exhibits are well presented but half the museum was closed off.",
          "Beautiful collection of Minoan (and graeco-roman) archaeological treasures. Go and see for yourself!",
          "I am a moderate fan of museums but this was tremendous, I spend 1 hour in a rush but it would be good to stay 2h, they have splendid collection of masterpieces from Crete, they are beautiful now and hard to imagine that they were created 4000 years ago, definetely worth going",
          "This museum is a must if you visit Crete, is a great complement to your visit Knossos!. I gave a really bad review to our visit based on our experience with the personnel working at the museum, my family and I had the opportunity to visit multiple museums around the globe and",
          "Unless you are an archaeologist, Minoan site visits can be frustrating and disappointing. A prior visit to this excellent museum will give you a few clues about what you will find at the sites.",
          "A wonderful large museum which we visited after spending the morning at Knossos Archeological Site. This museum is full of amazing exhibits from the site and you need a minimum of two hours to absorb all the history on show.",
          "Great location with so many excellent treasures from Knossos palace and other places. It is near the pedestrian street with great shopping and restaurants.",
          "Incredible artefacts on display well laid out and very informative. Brings the whole Minoan civilisation to life. Really enjoyed our visit.",
          "The Museum exhibits some of the most significant and unique objects, and artefacts, sculptures and murals from the glorious Minoan era and Ancient times. Moreover the Museum frequently organizes various interesting events, increasing interaction with local community. The Museum",
          "Get the joint ticket for the museum and Knossos, but go to the museum first. So much was dug up out of Crete rulers\u2019 tombs from 5000 BC, and it\u2019s on display here, in very good condition with easy to read descriptions. The sophistication of Crete\u2019s culture at the time of Egypt",
          "This museum is so interesting. There are so many things to see and learn. The exhibitions and rooms are spectacular, the building itself is beautiful, and there is an area outside where you can eat or just sit and relax with a view of the city. Love this place.",
          "Europe\u2019s ancient history presented simply and beautifully. You do not need a guide to enjoy this lovely place. The gift shop is minimal",
          "I had purchased a combined ticket for the Knossos archaeological site and the museum. I was not aware about what exactly was exhibited in this museum and hence very pleasantly surprised. There are around 25 rooms, chronologically arranged, in which there are exhibits of the",
          "We visited Crete for the first time this year and had high hopes of this museum; it had been hyped to the skies. As I'd recently finished a museum skills course, I was also very interested to see how things were done in a country other than my own. And there were some beautiful",
          "Wonderful collection of Greek artifacts and plenty of information available, this museum is perfect for anyone who is interested in Greek history. However be advised, in conjunction with much of Crete, toilet paper is to thrown in a bin rather than down a toilet. This is fine,",
          "Do not miss visiting this museum. Wonderful artifacts and frescoes found at the Knossos Palace site. We had a private guide while touring the museum which enhanced our visit. A must see.",
          "Great display of Minoan artefacts, Roman/Greek statues & Frescoes. Part of the Greek/ Roman section was closed off. Spent over 2 hours there. You can buy a combined ticket, which allows you into Knossos Palace too. Warning though to those over 65, you must have 'proof of age' to",
          "I liked it a lot i went there my second day it was very interesting place to visit , its exactly in the center of Heraklion",
          "I advise you to combine a visit to this museum with a visit to the Palace at Knossos. You can buy a combination ticked if you wish to do so. This museum has a impressive display of Minoan art and/or other Minoan objects. I was especially impressed by the famous bull head and the",
          "The best museum to see Minoan civilization in Greece located in Heraklion Town centre. The complete collection of Cretan artefacts from Minoan era. A must visit & important attraction in Crete !",
          "Lots of archeological things, really versatile collection, a travel through time. I suggest to visit the museum first, then Knossos palace, so you can imagine better how the palace looked like. Here it's well explained and illustrated. I only rated 4 not 5 because less would be",
          "We ended up here before we went to Knossos but it honestly didn't matter. The age of the artifacts here is astounding and really makes you reconsider how you think about history.",
          "Had a fantastic tour of the Knossos Palace with We Guide, Joanna, and then got to see the many artifacts she mentioned on the tour.",
          "Very interesting walk around the museum you can easily do this yourself without a guide if you\u2019re prepared to take public transport from the suburbs. Amazing a lot of these items have survived such a long time! Only sight drawback it was heavy on the items such as pots and",
          "We spent two and a half hours at this museum. One of the best of its kind. Beautifully displayed with artifacts from different ancient sites.",
          "It's nice it's weird to get too and drive its easier... Toilets are on site, clean and well maintained",
          "Make sure you go here after visiting the Palace of Knossos, it all makes sense and shows off a fantastic collection of wonderful findings, there is a joint ticket available currently 16 Euros for both attractions, which represents a saving of 4 Euros as otherwise its 10 Euros",
          "This is a beautifully curated collection. Even with crowds it is enjoyable to visit. Getting in is efficient, but once in facilities such as bathrooms need an upgrade. At the time of our visit there was no cafe! Unbelievable for a museum of this importance. What a missed",
          "This museum is excellent. It has an excellent selection of artifacts from the region and is well curated. I often get impatient in museums, but I wish I could have spent more time here. It was impressive! I purchased the ticket that also got me into the palace at Knossos, which",
          "Went to this museum following a tour of Knossos on 5 June.. The museum is on 2 floors but after touring the ground floor exhibits when we went upstairs the only part open was the fresco display the rest of the floor was closed. This meant nearly half the museum was closed. When",
          "A detailed and interesting collection of historic Greek artefacts. Lots of information. Some amazing pieces that demonstrate the incredible craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks. A large amount of artefacts from Knossos are here and we preferred the museum to visiting the site",
          "This is a modern museum with a treasure trove of artefacts. Well presented, easy to move around and very well lit.",
          "My wife and I were truly in awe of what is on show at this amazing museum. Every item is unique and not one is duplicated. From beautiful Minoan relics 3000BC which make you wonder how they could produce such items given this was the Bronze Age! The layout is excellent and moves",
          "Not Le Louvre or the British national museum or any other great famous museum but a very large illustration and explanation of the mineo\u00e0n civilization !Amazing !",
          "Personally I would say this was the best museum I have ever been to. Truly I am amazed.The ancient Minoan artefacts are as stunning as anything you'd see in a museum of 20th century art. Even if you're not particularly interested in history or archaeology, I'd suggest",
          "We spent an entire day at the museum taking a deep dive into the amazing array of wonderful archaeological findings. The only complaint was the cafeteria was not open so we had to leave the museum to go to lunch. When we returned they told us there was no re-entry even though we",
          "Although not massive it has some amazing things, fantastic insight into the history of Crete. Some of the articles are beautiful and the craftsmanship from the period beggars belief. Worth a visit . Entrance is \u20ac10 for an adult the staff were very friendly and helpful too.",
          "This museum is considered one of the best archeological museums one must not miss the opportunity to visit whenbin Heraklion Crete.It focuses on mimoan civilazation and displays magnificent articrafts of that period.The mozaics are spectacular they are so vivid and fascinating",
          "It took us about 3 hours to get through the museum, and it wowed us all the way through, from the earliest civilizations through the entire history of ancient Greece. Every time I thought I had seen the coolest piece ever, there was another piece on display that was even",
          "For anyone interested in our past history the Minoan culture is mind blowing. The exhibition is first class and for a non historian very humbling. If you are Heraklion then don\u2019t miss this. I saw with a tour group but hung around until everyone left, I could then the the",
          "An excellent museum! So many things to see. The Greek civilization exposed in a perfect way. Don\u2019t leave without visiting the upper floor with the frescos.",
          "A very nice museum who somebody can see details for Minoan civilization through different eras, from 3500 BC to 1100 BC. It's located in city centre, at old town. Average time of visit lasts from two to three hours and price ticket is 10 euros for adults. Definitely a good value",
          "We actually visited this collection twice during our stay as we are particularly interested in ceramics and the collection is stunning. However I couldn\u2019t bring myself to give five stars as I\u2019m in agreement with the people who have mentioned the staff, who in my opinion were",
          "I have been to alot of museums in alot of different countries and this was a whole new experience. The artifacts and material are very interesting however we did not spend as long as I would have liked as I felt all the staff were staring. Anytime you go near anything to look at",
          "The Museum is well laid out and has a blizzard of interesting artifacts. Incredibly they are mostly BC and if you go here first, then Knossos as a secondary visit might be mads a more interesting to your imagination. Surely, you have to add this Museum to your list if you have",
          "I think that the museum itself is very nice, but the organisation of tour guides are entirely below the standards. I was so unlucky that I meet inside the museum four guides. Two of them were ok - Polish and English - they were using microphones and headphones - usual standard",
          "The museum is stunning and full of amazing Artefacts. It's incredible to think that most of the items on display are thousands of years old. It takes you back in time and allows you to marvel at how such intricate items were made with basic tooling and materials. One thing that",
          "Toured the museum with a guide, which was excellent. However, we had to zip around a great deal of the rooms, which took about an hour. Not enough time, but if you leave, your ticket does not allow you to re enter! So many wonderful items!",
          "After visiting the palaces at Knossos, Malia and others, come here to this beautiful new museum and see the fabulous art and artifacts from the Minoan archaological sites. The upstairs also has some Greek and Roman works but they were closed as was the small cafe when we were",
          "So interesting! You need time to see all these fantastic things! So you need to arrange to have enough time to spend.",
          "We visited here on a guided tour after we had been to the Knossos Temple earlier in the day. It has some amazing artefacts from the Minoan and early roman civilisations. Our tour guide said it had only just reopened after three years of renovation. It is good to combine both",
          "An almost unbelievable collection of artefacts from pre-Minoan to Romano-Greek sites on the island. The Minoan era collection is mostly of grave goods and, because these personal possessions and offerings were carefully buried, they are in outstanding condition. The decoration",
          "An extremely interesting visit to this museum. Part of the museum was closed along with the restaurant. Very well laid out interior with well presented artefacts dating back to 7000 BC right up to 0 AD.",
          "We had been looking forward to visiting the museum (and then visiting Knossos) for years, and the place is beautifully laid out and perfectly lit. So much to see! But...about a third of the museum was closed off (one guard said that they didn\u2019t have the staff to keep it open)",
          "A very well laid out myseum with fabulous, mind-bogglingly beautiful artefacts from all the sites in Crete. Should not be missed. Strategically placed benches. Lifts to the upper floor. Do not miss the film at the end explaining the history of the museum itself.",
          "Well organised and presented. Very pleasant and specious venue with a superb Collection. Helpful staff that were keen to answer questions.",
          "This is a well laid out the museum that depicts the ancient history of Knossos. I would probably recommend visiting this museum for about an hour before visiting Knossos itself. It provides a good background that allows one to better associate the ruined at Knossos.",
          "A stunning collection of artefacts which were displayed well with very indepth explanations along the way. The best part however is the layout, which you follow room by room until you reach the exit. Spent 2 hours there and loved it. Only improvement would be either A/C or",
          "Chose to go here as it was too hot to walk around Knossos, after speaking with people I think we got more information here than at Knossos ruins. The artefacts themselves, quality of displays etc. were very good. I would have liked shorter information labels on individual",
          "The quality of some of the pieces is amazing given the period they come from. We had an excellent guide who gave us much contextual history. Really great space, good displays.",
          "The museum displays artifacts from the Island's history dating back thousands of years. from the stone age onwards. It has an excellent collection of artifacts from the Minoan civilization which flourished on the island and is considered the best in the World for Minoan Art.",
          "This is a must see if one is at all interested in the origins of Western Civilization. Extensive collection of artifacts from Minoan and earlier civilizations. Many of the artifacts are from the nearby Knossos Palace archeological site, but also include artifacts from other",
          "Interesting, but more information about every object would be necessary, or a guided Tour. A little bit boring for children as there are no interactive activities.",
          "Best visited after a trip to the Kinossos Palace ruins, and easily accessible by the same #2 bus on your return journey. Remember to buy a joint entry ticket at Kinossos Nicely laid out and explained. Wealth of artefacts from 2000BC onwards. Amazing condition and artistry/",
          "This museum is amazing, nothing like the usual dusty array of boring artefacts. Some of the exhibits are incredible, hard to believe they date from 1600-3000 bc. The jewellery on display is fantastic.",
          "So many artefacts on show, I spent hours here. An absolute steal for the price of entry. I bought the ticket to this combined with access to the Palace of Knossos. Mindblowing displays, with everything very well explained in concise English.",
          "2 floors. Simple layout. Glad we had a tour guide with us to lead us through or I might not have appreciated it as much. Beautiful murals and pottery.",
          "I spent hours and hours in this wonderful museum. What a tremendous collection of artifacts from the ancient Greek civilization! This is a MUST SEE when in Crete.",
          "The museum houses many artefacts displayed in a chronological manner. The staff advise as to the best route and although notices say no photography is allowed no one prevented photographs being taken although no flash was used. The fresco displays on the second floor are",
          "The museum is a very good place to get a great overview from the Minoan time and history. Take your time, for sure you will need 2 hours or more.",
          "double up and see the place of knossos for 16 euros a great way to spend an afternoon . went on a Sunday and the cafe was closed which was dissapopinting. but the exhibits are excellent and lots of places to sit , when you get to our age and having spent 3 hours walking around",
          "Well worth a visit , very interesting to learn about the past of such a fascinating place we all enjoyed it",
          "The ticket is sold along with Knossos palace by paying just 1 euro extra. It is recommended to visit the place after seeing the palace. The museum is on 2 floors. The ground has all artifacts recovered from Knossos. The bee pendant is the highlight. Scripts, statues, vessels,",
          "We enjoyed the Archaeological Museum very much, it is even free for students in the EU! There was a lot of information on all the artefacts which were well maintained. There was a lot of history that I recognised from visiting Knossos Palace and there is certainly a lot to learn",
          "see Crete from years gone by.you need a good few hours to see all the amazing artifacts on show here,great day out",
          "If you intended to visite Knossos then YOU-must visit the museum first or you won\u2019t understand all the guide will tell you, it is important to take your time and read all the information provided, the museum would clearly benefit from some audio guide or a tablet application to",
          "We were informed that the museum does not provide guided tours. This however was no drawback because of the description on the object lables was also in English.",
          "We visit here prior to going to Knossos & what a good idea that was. The exhibits are well laid out & the information is good. If you are over 65 & take photo I.d. you can get a combined ticket for this, & Knossos, at half price.",
          "Very attractive in layout and presentation of a huge array of artifacts from Neolithic times forward to Roman era. Great insights into skills and wealth of the Minoan and Cretan cultures and Empires. Especially the development of pottery, jewelry and working with rocks.",
          "Great museum with lots of English explanations, tons of material and very much a professional museum! Well worth the money, and we learned a lot!",
          "It was interesting, yet the information could be more elaborate. We missed the interaction and would have liked more different items and explanations",
          "We purchased the combination ticket for Knossos and the museum and enjoyed both. There were lots of helpful signs along with displays. Some of the frescoes were more modern completion than original, but still beautiful. Sometimes can get clogged up with big groups, but well",
          "Both the collection of this museum and its presentation are breathtaking. A definite must-see. Go there before you visit Knossos.",
          "Okay, so I know a bit about history and archaeology and a lot of the exhibits had meaning for me but the overall effect of this 'modern' museum was simply a let-down. For the average customer I can see much of the display falling into the boring category. Little attention has",
          "Great to do after the palace of Knossos so very interesting stuff here over 6000 years old not to be missed",
          "Well-presented items from the archaeological sites in Crete and the surrounding islands. Explanations in English. A manageable museum that enhances your understanding of the Minoan and later civilizations. If you visit the ruins, you need to visit the museum.",
          "Interesting Museum with lots of beautiful vessels and gold jewellery even the modern women would be proud to wear. The history behind each display was fascinating. Really enjoyed our visit here.",
          "If you like ancient Greece it is a must see for you. Rich descriptions, well organized displays and hundreds of excellent artifacts showing what was lost. It is really amazing collection. What I missed most was more modern times. Have at least 2 hrs to see all rooms.",
          "Museum is laid out well, without crowding, so we were able to browse around others fairly easily. The combined ticket with knossos makes thia good value. We parked at the port for \u00a32.50 for the day.",
          "Beautiful museum dedicated to the extraordinary finds taken by the 20th century finds of Evans at Knossos. Priceless pieces of mosaic, ceramics and Gold jewelry. Plan at least an hour to work your way through thevexhabits",
          "This museum is a gem. Very different content to the new archeological museum in Athens. We particularly loved the frescoes from around 2000 B.C., many of which were from the Minoan Knossos palace (about 6km away), but there is much, much more. Artefacts are beautifully",
          "Since the construction of a brand new archaeological museum in Heraklion (I think it opened it 2012) the stunning finds from all over Crete are now properly displayed for the very first time. A joint ticket (valid for three days) is available for both entrance to the",
          "It was worth the visit. The communities in that era was very advanced. It came as a surprise. I was very impressed with some of the pottery design and functionality. I can see where a lot of gold jewellery design cane from ( even the ones from a India and China). There was a",
          "Once you have visited Knossos, the palace at Phaistos or the palace at Malia head back to this museum and spend a wonderful afternoon absorbed in history. At Knossos you can buy a joint ticket so entry to the museum will only be 1 euro rather than 5 euros - not sure whether",
          "This is a very good museum with exhibits from many different periods showing extensive history of Crete",
          "For an intro to Minoan culture, visitors should plan for a few hours at least at this modern museum. Lots of fascinating artifacts with descriptions in Greek and in English.",
          "went there with a package tour and tour guide. it was very interesting and leant a lot about history of Crete and minoan kingdom. definitely worth a visit if you are interest in the culture and history of Crete.",
          "This museum provides a very important complement to a visit to the ruins of the Temple of Knossos. As much as the Knossos site is very poorly presented, this museum makes up for it with beautifully presented and described artefacts dating back to the beginnings of the Minoan",
          "The exhibits are superb and the museum itself is a joy. Everything is displayed beautifully. What a great collection they have. The treasures of Knossos are in the museum.",
          "Nicely organized and a great pair to see before knossos. Lots of great minoan artifacts showing the evolution of their culture.",
          "The museum we well designed and there were good informatics. The title sounds a bit glib but we were genuinely blown away by the exhibits especially those from over 5000 years ago. Some of the jewellery and ceramics could match those produced today. The cafe was closed so go for",
          "Absolutely amazing exhibits from the minion civilization..... cap this off with a trip to the larger archeological museum in Athens !",
          "23 years since my last visit to the museum and (being older and possibly wiser) my decision to re-visit was a good one. The museum is amazing and the number of exhibits, both large and small, overwhelming and breathtaking, allowing you to appreciate the unbelievable artistry and",
          "Great place for history, but go here as well as Knossos Palace so you can see where they got a lot of the exhibits from.",
          "I visited after I saw the attraction (Knossos, downtown, port) and I learned so much more about the history. I highly recommend a visit.",
          "Amazed about the history of crete !!! Very friendly staff i definetely recomend it . Its a must going there .",
          "If you are interested in history, and planning on visiting any ruins on Crete, you must stop first at this fantastic museum. The displays are informative, and very well laid out. Phenomenal objects on display! It could definitely be improved for children and those interested in",
          "Don't miss this-worth the trip to Crete. Do not let your tour group short-change the time you need to visit this museum.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It's well thought out, and the content is really interesting. The miniature reconstructions of Knossos was helpful and beautiful. Good collections and good organization.",
          "So much rich ancient history for the region I had no idea! Great educational experience for the whole family. Also great companion to the Knossos site.",
          "We ran round and had a great time here. Really fascinating exhibits with some great pieces from the palace at Knossos - best done after the palace so that the pieces add up.",
          "Allow plenty of time to read, gaze, wander and reflect on the magnificent collection of Cretan artefacts, many from Knossos, assembled in this one place, from long ago! One has to marvel at the ingenuity, creativity, sophistication, hard work, training, loveliness and beauty of",
          "A great collection of objects from Minoan sites, sorted chronologically and supported by informative boards and interactive screens. Most exhibited items are ceramics but the styles and uses are so varied that it would be hard to get bored. You can also learn about the Minoan",
          "A nice museum, but have a guide! My second time here, and there is hard to understand stories and stuff just by looking!",
          "The numerous findings from the Palace of Knossos such as art, pottery, vessels, figurines, and the original wall-paintings, are all housed in Archaeological Museum of Heraklion. This museum contains the most important Minoan collection.",
          "Minimum 2 hours to enjoy it. Best sight in town. Indoor, fully air conditioning during summer. I was thrilled by the golden ring of King Minos. Ideal to be combined with shopping. There is combined ticket with Knossos Palace which is 5km south of the town. There is cheap blue",
          "An excellent presentation of artifacts of vases, statues, jewellery that have been dated 2000 and 3000 BC. Makes you realise there was a well ordered civilisation that the Greeks of today feel in their DNA. I felt that this was much more enlightening than Knossos. Of course",
          "Just of off the large central square is the museum which costs 16 per adult for a three day ticket including Knossos The museum is firstly well laid out in date order and colour coded so easy to walk through However what is more interesting is the collection which has many",
          "Truly unique pieces to Crete. Quite a bit of history here so ensure you have at least an hour or two to visit. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum is quite small but very interesting and well presented ! I much more appreciated that place to the Cnossos Palace and I really felt here the importance of the civilization presented there. Definiticely the place to see in Heraklion !",
          "It is definitely essential, not only for the fans of history tourism to pay a visit to this museum, since it its expedition includes the most significant parts of Greek history and especially the Minoan culture 2500 years BC.One disadvantage is that auto guide is not available.",
          "If you want to see the miracles a great ancient civilization can create you must visit the Historical museum of Crete. A unique experience that you will remember for the rest of your life.",
          "Please go there to watch and admire a great ancient civilization, the Minoan one. Wonderful pieces of art magnificently displayed. You will not regret your visit.",
          "The museum was straightforward and easy to understand. It was also winter time during our visit, so the tickets were half-priced. We walked through the museum without a guide, and it was manageable. The rooms are labeled and a suggested route is plotted out, so you just have",
          "This is a wonderful museum showcasing the finds from the Minoan Civilisation in Crete. Dating from early times onwards the main focus is 2000 - 1200 BCE. There are statues, pottery, flints and much more. The colourful wall paintings are stunning. You can spend 1,2, 3 or even 4",
          "We greatly enjoyed this superb museum. Having visited three Minoan sites it was so rewarding to see so many treasured artefacts clearly displayed. There was an excellent introduction to each section and good descriptions in English by the artefacts. The Minoan civilisation was",
          "This is an incredible collection of artefacts and a must see if visiting the area. Not expensive and easy place to find. Close to the centre of town so easy walking distance.",
          "We visited the Heraklion Archeological Museum last September. Place is awsome! Very nice and organised!",
          "Great overview of the major historical artefacts around Crete and giving the back story on the island and its history. While this attraction is by no means cheap, if you enjoy museums you will find this attraction a must see. I would say the quality of the exhibits are on par",
          "Such a great museum. I really appreciated the phaestus disc. So cool and interesting to read about. The museum takes a long time so come prepared. We did it at night and loved it. Not many people and cooler temps. Highly recommended. Our favorite thing besides going to Knossos.",
          "The museum is perfect: modern, full of information, clean, well illuminated. Today it was half price so I even got a great bargain at five euros. I strongly suggest it to anyone, more than Knossos. I stayed inside two hours...",
          "Very well presented, with good explanations. Not too many people and the area of this city is worth being visited as well A few parkings outside",
          "Good Museum, lots to see and well displayed, visited just on a day visits as part of a cruise party. Would've been good to have more time to look at the artefacts in more depth.",
          "Everything you ever wanted to know about the Minoan civilisation. Unbeatable. Later Greek and Roman period, also good. Down side is that it can be a bit hard for kids, as it is not interactive.",
          "If you go to only one museum on Crete, make it this one, and plan to spend at least 3 hours, or better, go 2 days in a row. Great collection, well displayed. Only downside is that they close at 3, as do other museums in Heraklion.",
          "This Museum was wonderful. However, if you buy the \u20183 day combo ticket with Knossos Palace\u2019 you can only visit each place once. When we went to the Museum the entire 1st floor was closed. We were told that we couldn\u2019t come back the next day. Eventually, the ticket seller did",
          "Exceptional and exciting place! The beginnings of European civilization, but also of the visible influences of other civilizations of the Middle East! Each exhibit leaves a deep impression. Artistic expression, craftsmanship, beauty of these objects fascinates you. It was worth",
          "A museum well worth visiting. The range and quality of the artefacts is truly stunning. Recommend giving yourselves plenty of time or even making two visits to take it all in!",
          "After extensive renovation, the museum finally has the facilities needed to house such a wide and important array of exhibits hailing mainly from the Minoan civilization. Only thing I would like to comment is that I didn't find an easily accessible map of the ancient cities",
          "Great exhibits of some of the most famous and significant historical arifacts of ancient civilizations. I am glad I can now say I saw these with my own eyes before I die.",
          "I travel a lot and have been to many museums and honestly it is one of the best perhaps the best. Why? the layout of the museum allow for easy follow of history. The artefacts are fantastic. I was amazed at how the Minoan people were such great artisans. Definitely worth the",
          "Heraklion (or more accurately, Heracleon) has an excellent museum, unlike anything you can find on the planet. It houses the best exchibition of Minoan art. The Minoans, at their peak, generated culture that still feels contemporary, and influenced abstract art (Picasso and the",
          "We had just 2 hours. Not enough time! There is so much to see, so much to wonder at, such beauty & ingenuity, so well displayed. We only had time to dip in here & there, and left feeling quite frustrated at how much we missed, as we know we'll never be back. PS be careful not",
          "One of the oldest, largest and most important museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. The Herakleion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.",
          "This is worth a visit to see the famous frescoes from the palace at Knossos. It is not the best type of museum for kids as not very interactive at all. So if you travel with kids...concentrate on the main things and try to help them engage with the artefacts.",
          "This is fairly new and worth seeing. We were on a cruise and only had a half day in crete so we bought a combo ticket for this s=and knossos palace great value!",
          "Must see it ! Perfect archeological museum and it was good occasion with free entrance on Saturday afternoon",
          "You need to go there. It's a cultural journey that you must be in. It's actually accessible cause it's close to the most know square : the lion square.",
          "An excellent museum, really well curated - taking you through the Minoan, Greek and Roman periods. Definitely recommend visiting here before going to any of the actual archaeological sites around Crete.",
          "Visited this lovely museum before Knosses. Feel it was right way to do it. Bought joint tickets for both venues. Learnt a lot in well laid out museum. Not busy this time of year. Could have stayed longer than the 2 hours we stayed there but, it closes earlier in winter. 4pm.",
          "You can easily spend up to a couple of hours here, very informative and well laid out. Be careful of the times in winter, as it closes at 4pm.",
          "Very informative place, great works of art and archeological foundings. Here You can learn about Cretan (and greek) history, You can almost feel and touch it. Many beautiful subjects from minoan age, i love the FAISTOS, the bull's head and the original pieces of Knossos frescs.",
          "On a short one day visit to Heraklion we visited both the Palace of Knossos and the Archaeological Museum. Doing both complemented each other well. We took a private tour at the Palace but did a self-tour in the museum. The museum was top-notch in its presentation and have",
          "You just cannot go to Crete and fail to visit the Heraklion museum! You will get amazed by the findings, the detailed decorations, the drawings, the coins, and jewelry. I keep wondering what a great civilization that was! No wonder why Minoans had no enemies and their",
          "We had a short visit unfortunately, but the collection, pieces as well as the organisation, but the staff is awfully rude, which quite spoil the visit... I advise to have at least 2hours ahead.",
          "It is a must! We only had a half day, and I could have easily spent an entire day in there and wish I were closer so I could go back. The restaurant was not open, so I can't comment on it, but there are a lot of places to eat in the vicinity.",
          "We went to the museum on the first Sunday of the month (Free admission). Even with the large crowds the staff kept everything flowing smoothly. Pictures are allowed (no flash). They have a lot of items from pre historic (11 century BC and earlier) times and a wonderful display",
          "Well worth a visit shows so much of the history of Crete makes it easier to understand even if you are not a history fan.",
          "Not at all impressive externally but surprisingly good museum inside! What you are left with is the story of the inevitable rise and fall of the Minoan civilization, from the start in the Bronze Age, through Iron Age, it\u2019s peak and decline.. except it lasted over 1,500 years!",
          "2 floors of stuff, the main things of interest are the Minoan-era items prior to the Hellenic era. Very interesting 'Kamares ware' pottery style I've never seen before. Also the fresco styles are unique, somewhat Egyptian-influenced. I didnt know bull-jumping was a sport!",
          "We spent the day at this amazing museum. There are so so many wonderful exhibits to see here you really need time to take everything in. I thought the bathtub exhibit was the most amazing. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful to be able to see all of the things that are in this museum. It",
          "Excellent museum, showing artefacts from Knossos and other Minoan sites. Exhibits set out in a very organized way with plenty of light and space. It certainly enhanced our visit to Knossos.",
          "This is an absolute must-visit location when in Crete. So glad we took time to see it after our visit to Knossos, it gave a much much better perspective of the Minoan civilization. Very impressive collection of artefacts, all real and authentic (not reconstructed as in Knossos),",
          "We were on a short holiday in Crete and decided that we would like to take a day trip to Heraklion and the Palace of Knossos, We found a tour by Sparrow Travel, which suited us as it picked us up and dropped us off near to our hotel. We paid a combined ticket for the",
          "Really enjoyed our visit after seeing Knossos, brought home the importance of the dig with some really interesting art & jewellery. All displays in French, English, German, Greek & Russian. No queuing lots of Information.",
          "First visit to this Museum. We went on an organised tour from Rethymno with Klados. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and my niece listened intently and found the whole experience wonderful.",
          "The exterior of the building can in no way prepare you for the amazing inside of this spacious museum, which in my opinion is easily one of the top 3 Greek museums. It will take some time to explore but it's the ABSOLUTE MUST when you visit Heraklion!",
          "A must when in Heraklion. The exhibits of one of the most ancient civilisations in the world are spectacular. Don't miss the Phestos discus. Great renovation work.",
          "Easy going museum in the center of Heraklion. Well laid out and interesting without being boring. Highly recommend.",
          "This is a mst if you like history. Very well displayd, although they could work a liitle with the lights. Generous photo policy. Good explanations. Not to be missed if you are interested in history.",
          "After visited Knosos that lacks good and scientific explanations, we also visited Archeological museum, which was great and to me it seemed like everything makes much more sense. There are two floors + usually one extra, smaller exhibition. Btw: there are some dates when they",
          "If you like artifacts and history this place is for you. Very interesting to see how the civilization developed on Crete. I didn\u2019t have time to go to the actual site, but felt like this gave me a good feel for the development of the early civilizations and their beliefs. Highly",
          "One of the best archaeological museums although it doesn't have the size of the British Museum or Louvre. Every object shown is absolutely unique and notable for understanding of the importance of Crete civilization at the time of Minoans.",
          "Spent the day touring the palace of Knossos and also this museum. They really go hand in hand as most of the artifacts here come from Knossos. I would actually stop here first if you have a choice and if you can get a good tour guide it is a major plus. Mostly pottery and",
          "I went on a Sunday after going to the Palace of Knossos. I ended up being free entry. The courtyard was beautiful: columns, shaded with trees and lots of places to sit. A great place to sit and chill out before or after a visit to the museum. You do have to go through a little",
          "Excellent museum, showing artefacts from Knossos and other Minoan sites. Allow two hours or more if you want to rest between exhibits. See this before going to Knossos. There is a combined ticket for both, and if you are over 65, hold and bring an EU passport with you, it's",
          "We went all they way from Sissi to see this museum but unfortunately it was closed as the staff were on strike!",

          "We visited with are 6 month old and used a stroller inside. The Museum has lots to look at and the combo ticket with the archeological site does not cost much more. We first went to the museum and then the site but I would do it the other way around on the next visit.",
          "Do not miss this museum if you go to Heraklion!! Everything is well-thought-out and you move through the museum in chronological order, which helps you to build on what you learn and do so progressively. Took 2 hours to go through all the rooms (2 floors); I took lots of pics.",
          "An incredible wealth of artifacts and information about the past. One could spend much more than 2-3 hours here, but I found that 3 hours was the maximum amount of time before I was so exhausted that i couldn't take in any more (and I did not read every sign or look closely at",
          "Everything Minoan you can think of. Spent about three hours here. Well organized and presented artifacts.",
          "I have never seen anything like these artifacts. So much history and so much truth. We rented a car and saw CRETE. It was an unbelievably Amazing trip. If you visit Greece please island hop and make sure to stop by Crete and see this BEAUTIFUL island full of history and",
          "It was totally one of the best museums I have visited. Really organized and all of its exhibits were stunning!",
          "The exhibits are well done and displayed many artifacts. We learned a lot from the descriptions. We appreciated the free stroller to use for our baby and there is a coat check as well. The garden area outside the museum is peaceful. It was nice that the museum stayed open until",
          "A story well told and explained of the life of human of Crete, through its objects of everyday life, art and other artifacts, with details that are worth to know. I also enjoyed very much the discovery of their civilizations, their moments, their religion, and much more.",
          "The museum holds most of the great finds from the early civilisation on Crete. Wonderful. Early jewellery is exquisite and early writing v important as well as huge pots and tiny statues of female deities. Really valuable to go before Knossos and Malia etc. Get an idea of the",
          "Interesting artifacts to view. You can take pictures in some areas of the museum. There are good descriptions in each area to identify what you are looking at. Also, there are museum personnel in each room who can assist with questions. If you are going to visit the Palace or",
          "Don't leave Heraklion without seeing this incredible museum, which opened up a new world of old history for me.",
          "Visited this museum on a recent trip to Heraklion would recommend highly. It is well laid out and extremely informative and needs at least 3/4 hours to get the best out of it. Well worth a visit.",
          "What could I say: incredible museum, a must-do in a trip to Crete to learn the history and events that made this island. But most of all, to understand how small we are thinking to our technology comparing with what they were able to do at that time with nothing. I don't know",
          "A very interesting and modern Museum with lots of exhibits from Cretan history. Good facilities toilets, restaurant etc,",
          "The artifacts on display are very impressive and give an excellent record of (particularly) the Minoan history and culture. The downside for me was the the lack of explanation of the 'bigger picture'. A bit more effort explaining the context in which these artifacts were found",
          "This museums contains a collection of all things Minoan such as jewellery, pottery, seals, art, etc, as well as some original frescos from arechelogical sites. Considering the age of the Minoan culture the displayed objects are really impressive and give an idea how advanced the",

          "I'm not usually a museum person, I'll admit, but my friend convinced me to visit the Archaeological Museum with her and I'm honestly glad I did. If you go to the Palace of Knossos before, for one Euro more, you can also include a ticket to the Museum, so it's worth it to check",
          "His museum is a must see attraction. Even if you are a clueless fool who loves only celebrity culture you should come here just to see how little we have developed in 5000 years. The museum is stuffed full of magnificent artefacts from the Minoan culture, many of which were",
          "The museum focuses on the Minoan and Roman periods of Crete's history. The Minoan component is particularly well-presented, and is an essential complement to a visit to Knosssos or any other of the Minoan sites in the region. The museum is easily accessible. Tickets to visit",
          "My husband and I just went to the Heraklion Archaeological Museum this afternoon, and were completely impressed with both the size and scope of the collection, and its presentation. The museum begins with the Minoan civilization, that began around 7000 B.C. and ended around 1100",
          "We had a great time exploring the elaborate collection of the museum, they have a lot of beautifull pieces that help you visualise the life in the old civilisations. If you plan on visiting the Knossos palace site within 3 days it\u2019s worth buying the combo ticket, saves you a lot",
          "I you are in Crete even for one day, a visit to an Archaeological museum is a must. The building seems to be newly renovated, spacious halls, amazing artifacts on display with English commentaries. Highly recommended!",

          "16 euros gets you a combined ticket for the museum and knossos which you can spread over 3 days. It's basically full of artefacts from 5000 bc to the Roman period but specialising in the Minoan period up to 1450bc. If you like pots this is for you. Seriously some impressive",
          "This is really one of the best places in the world to see an extensive collection of Minoan art and artefacts. This is now housed in a modern purpose built museum which overlays some historic ruins in the grounds. If you plan to visit Knossos buy a joint entry ticket for",

          "The ruins of Knossos near Heraklion are impressive, but they have no museum, you only see footings and the ruins of buildings, many restored in the early 20th century. To truly see Cretan culture - from the earliest times through the Minoan civilisation to the time of the Romans",
          "This is a must visit after the Knossos Archaeological Site.....there is so much to see and so many exhibits are in amazing condition considering their age. Make sure you purchase the combo ticket which gives you entry to both.",

          "We visited this museum in October 2018. The collection of rare artifacts is unbelievable. The exhibition is very well organised. Although it was busy with many German groups we could find a chance to approach every showcase we were interested in. One recommendation for tourists",
          "We did things the opposite of the tours. we saw the museum first and then Knossos. We like this better because we feel we can place the items in the museum better when we go the site. This worked out well in this case as their is a scale model in the museum. It is very well laid",
          "Made two trips to the Archaeological Museum - there is a lot to see. It is all very well presented. Can be crowded.",

        "wiki": "Sonar (sound navigation ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name \"sonar\": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of \"targets\" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward-looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.\nThe first recorded use of the technique was by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490 who used a tube inserted into the water to detect vessels by ear. It was developed during World War I to counter the growing threat of submarine warfare, with an operational passive sonar system in use by 1918. Modern active sonar systems use an acoustic transducer to generate a sound wave which is reflected from target objects.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough some animals (dolphins, bats, some shrews, and others) have used sound for communication and object detection for millions of years, use by humans in the water is initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490: a tube inserted into the water was said to be used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube.In the late 19th century an underwater bell was used as an ancillary to lighthouses or lightships to provide warning of hazards.The use of sound to \"echo-locate\" underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation seems to have been prompted by the Titanic disaster of 1912. The world's first patent for an underwater echo-ranging device was filed at the British Patent Office by English meteorologist Lewis Fry Richardson a month after the sinking of Titanic, and a German physicist Alexander Behm obtained a patent for an echo sounder in 1913.The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden, while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston, Massachusetts, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse code) and echo ranging (detecting an iceberg at a 2-mile, 3.2 km range). The \"Fessenden oscillator\", operated at about 500 Hz frequency, was unable to determine the bearing of the iceberg due to the 3-metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer's radiating face (less than \u200b1\u20443 wavelength in diameter). The ten Montreal-built British H-class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with Fessenden oscillators.During World War I the need to detect submarines prompted more research into the use of sound. The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer Constantin Chilowsky, worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915. Although piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, this work influenced future designs. Lightweight sound-sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones, while Terfenol-D and PMN (lead magnesium niobate) have been developed for projectors.\n\n\n=== ASDIC ===\n\nIn 1916, under the British Board of Invention and Research, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A. B. Wood, producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917. This work, for the Anti-Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff, was undertaken in utmost secrecy, and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world's first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus. To maintain secrecy, no mention of sound experimentation or quartz was made \u2013 the word used to describe the early work (\"supersonics\") was changed to \"ASD\"ics, and the quartz material to \"ASD\"ivite: \"ASD\" for \"Anti-Submarine Division\", hence the British acronym ASDIC. In 1939, in response to a question from the Oxford English Dictionary, the Admiralty made up the story that it stood for \"Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee\", and this is still widely believed, though no committee bearing this name has been found in the Admiralty archives.By 1918, Britain and France had built prototype active systems. The British tested their ASDIC on HMS Antrim in 1920 and started production in 1922. The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC-equipped vessels in 1923. An anti-submarine school HMS Osprey and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924. \nBy the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hampered by the use of the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied with new tactics and new weapons.\nThe tactical improvements developed by Frederic John Walker included the creeping attack. 2 anti-submarine ships were needed for this (usually sloops or corvettes). The \"directing ship\" tracked the target submarine on ASDIC from a position about 1500 to 2000 yards behind the submarine. The second ship, with her ASDIC turned off and running at 5 knots, started an attack from a position between the directing ship and the target. This attack was controlled by radio telephone from the directing ship, based on their ASDIC and the range (by rangefinder) and bearing of the attacking ship. As soon as the depth charges had been released, the attacking ship left the immediate area at full speed. The directing ship then entered the target area and also released a pattern of depth charges. The low speed of the approach meant the submarine could not predict when depth charges were going to be released. Any evasive action was detected by the directing ship and steering orders to the attacking ship given accordingly. The low speed of the attack had the advantage that the German acoustic torpedo was not effective against a warship travelling so slowly. A variation of the creeping attack was the \"plaster\" attack, in which 3 attacking ships working in a close line abreast were directed over the target by the directing ship.The new weapons to deal with the ASDIC blind spot were \"ahead-throwing weapons\", such as Hedgehogs and later Squids, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and still in ASDIC contact. These allowed a single escort to make better aimed attacks on submarines. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets that used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used.\nEarly in World War II (September 1940), British ASDIC technology was transferred for free to the United States. Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US. Many new types of military sound detection were developed. These included sonobuoys, first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename High Tea, dipping/dunking sonar and mine-detection sonar. This work formed the basis for post-war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine.\n\n\n=== SONAR ===\nDuring the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound-detection technology, and important discoveries were made, such as the existence of thermoclines and their effects on sound waves. Americans began to use the term SONAR for their systems, coined by Frederick Hunt to be the equivalent of RADAR.\n\n\n=== US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory ===\nIn 1917, the US Navy acquired J. Warren Horton's services for the first time. On leave from Bell Labs, he served the government as a technical expert, first at the experimental station at Nahant, Massachusetts, and later at US Naval Headquarters, in London, England. At Nahant he applied the newly developed vacuum tube, then associated with the formative stages of the field of applied science now known as electronics, to the detection of underwater signals. As a result, the carbon button microphone, which had been used in earlier detection equipment, was replaced by the precursor of the modern hydrophone. Also during this period, he experimented with methods for towing detection. This was due to the increased sensitivity of his device. The principles are still used in modern towed sonar systems.\nTo meet the defense needs of Great Britain, he was sent to England to install in the Irish Sea bottom-mounted hydrophones connected to a shore listening post by submarine cable. While this equipment was being loaded on the cable-laying vessel, World War I ended and Horton returned home.\nDuring World War II, he continued to develop sonar systems that could detect submarines, mines, and torpedoes. He published Fundamentals of Sonar in 1957 as chief research consultant at the US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory. He held this position until 1959 when he became technical director, a position he held until mandatory retirement in 1963.\n\n\n=== Materials and designs in the US and Japan ===\nThere was little progress in US sonar from 1915 to 1940. In 1940, US sonars typically consisted of a magnetostrictive transducer and an array of nickel tubes connected to a 1-foot-diameter steel plate attached back-to-back to a Rochelle salt crystal in a spherical housing. This assembly penetrated the ship hull and was manually rotated to the desired angle. The piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystal had better parameters, but the magnetostrictive unit was much more reliable. High losses to US merchant supply shipping early in World War II led to large scale high priority US research in the field, pursuing both improvements in magnetostrictive transducer parameters and Rochelle salt reliability. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), a superior alternative, was found as a replacement for Rochelle salt; the first application was a replacement of the 24 kHz Rochelle-salt transducers. Within nine months, Rochelle salt was obsolete. The ADP manufacturing facility grew from few dozen personnel in early 1940 to several thousands in 1942.\nOne of the earliest application of ADP crystals were hydrophones for acoustic mines; the crystals were specified for low-frequency cutoff at 5 Hz, withstanding mechanical shock for deployment from aircraft from 3,000 m (10,000 ft), and ability to survive neighbouring mine explosions. One of key features of ADP reliability is its zero aging characteristics; the crystal keeps its parameters even over prolonged storage.\nAnother application was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were mounted on the torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar \u2013 a transducer was added to the torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.\nPassive sonar arrays for submarines were developed from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were arranged in a steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays.\nThe standard US Navy scanning sonar at the end of World War II operated at 18 kHz, using an array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5 kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and \"expendable modular design\", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.The Imperial Japanese Navy at the onset of World War II used projectors based on quartz. These were big and heavy, especially if designed for lower frequencies; the one for Type 91 set, operating at 9 kHz, had a diameter of 30 inches (760 mm) and was driven by an oscillator with 5 kW power and 7 kV of output amplitude. The Type 93 projectors consisted of solid sandwiches of quartz, assembled into spherical cast iron bodies. The Type 93 sonars were later replaced with Type 3, which followed German design and used magnetostrictive projectors; the projectors consisted of two rectangular identical independent units in a cast iron rectangular body about 16 by 9 inches (410 mm \u00d7 230 mm). The exposed area was half the wavelength wide and three wavelengths high. The magnetostrictive cores were made from 4 mm stampings of nickel, and later of an iron-aluminium alloy with aluminium content between 12.7% and 12.9%. The power was provided from a 2 kW at 3.8 kV, with polarization from a 20 V, 8 A DC source.\nThe passive hydrophones of the Imperial Japanese Navy were based on moving-coil design, Rochelle salt piezo transducers, and carbon microphones.\n\n\n=== Later developments in transducers ===\nMagnetostrictive transducers were pursued after World War II as an alternative to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to 13 feet (4.0 m) in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by prestressing. Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent of these improved magnetostrictive materials is Galfenol.\nOther types of transducers include variable-reluctance (or moving-armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on the surfaces of gaps, and moving coil (or electrodynamic) transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.\n\n\n== Active sonar ==\n\nActive sonar uses a sound transmitter (or projector) and a receiver. When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation.  When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation.  When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation.  Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically.\nActive sonar creates a pulse of sound, often called a \"ping\", and then listens for reflections (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals (\"pings\"). A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. chemically using explosives,  airguns or  plasma sound sources.\nTo measure the distance to an object, the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range using the known speed of sound. To measure the bearing, several hydrophones are used, and the set measures the relative arrival time to each, or with an array of hydrophones, by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called beamforming. Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multibeam systems are used. The target signal (if present) together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal processing, which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement.  It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise. This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display, or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software. Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it, as well as measuring its velocity.\nThe pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency (to allow pulse compression on reception). Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique. Since digital processing became available pulse compression has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques.  Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all-round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc, although the beam may be rotated, relatively slowly, by mechanical scanning.\nParticularly when single frequency transmissions are used, the Doppler effect can be used to measure the radial speed of a target.  The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity. Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion, allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform.\nOne useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight. The head is pointed into the water, a button is pressed, and the device displays the distance to the target. Another variant is a \"fishfinder\" that shows a small display with shoals of fish. Some civilian sonars (which are not designed for stealth) approach active military sonars in capability, with three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat.\nWhen active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom, it is known as echo sounding. Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement.\nActive sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.\nIn combat situations, an active pulse can be detected by an enemy and will reveal a submarine's position at twice the maximum distance that the submarine can itself detect a contact and give clues as to the submarines identity based on the characteristics of the outgoing ping. For these reasons, active sonar is not frequently used by military submarines.\nA very directional, but low-efficiency, type of sonar (used by fisheries, military, and for port security) makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non-linear sonar, the virtual transducer being known as a parametric array.\n\n\n=== Project Artemis ===\nProject Artemis was an experimental research and development project in the late 1950s to mid 1960s to examine acoustic propagation and signal processing for a low-frequency active sonar system that might be used for ocean surveillance. A secondary objective was examination of engineering problems of fixed active bottom systems. The receiving array was located on the slope of Plantagnet Bank off Bermuda. The active source array was deployed from the converted World War II tanker USNS Mission Capistrano. Elements of Artemis were used experimentally after the main experiment was terminated.\n\n\n=== Transponder ===\nThis is an active sonar device that receives a specific stimulus and immediately (or with a delay) retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one. Transponders can be used to remotely activate or recover subsea equipment.\n\n\n=== Performance prediction ===\nA sonar target is small relative to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, the power of the reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000 W/m2 signal at 1 m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m2 signal. At 100 m the signal will be 1 W/m2 (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m2 target, it will be at 0.001 W/m2 when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001 W/m2 until 3000 m. Any 10 m2 target between 100 and 3000 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse, but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes. Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example).\nActive sonar have two performance limitations: due to noise and reverberation.  In general, one or other of these will dominate, so that the two effects can be initially considered separately.\nIn noise-limited conditions at initial detection:\nSL \u2212 2PL + TS \u2212 (NL \u2212 AG) = DT,where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss (sometimes referred to as transmission loss), TS is the target strength, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain of the receiving array (sometimes approximated by its directivity index) and DT is the detection threshold.\nIn reverberation-limited conditions at initial detection (neglecting array gain):\n\nSL \u2212 2PL + TS = RL + DT,where RL is the reverberation level, and the other factors are as before.\n\n\n=== Hand-held sonar for use by a diver ===\nThe LIMIS (limpet mine imaging sonar) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar for use by a diver. Its name is because it was designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.\nThe LUIS (lensing underwater imaging system) is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.\nThere is or was a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers, that merely displays range.\nFor the INSS (integrated navigation sonar system)\n\n\n== Passive sonar ==\nPassive sonar listens without transmitting. It is often employed in military settings, although it is also used in science applications, e.g., detecting fish for presence/absence studies in various aquatic environments \u2013 see also passive acoustics and passive radar. In the very broadest usage, this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound, though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment.\n\n\n=== Identifying sound sources ===\nPassive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound. For example, U.S. vessels usually operate 60 Hz alternating current power systems. If transformers or generators are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull or become flooded, the 60 Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the submarine or ship. This can help to identify its nationality, as all European submarines and nearly every other nation's submarine have 50 Hz power systems. Intermittent sound sources (such as a wrench being dropped), called \"transients,\" may also be detectable to passive sonar. Until fairly recently, an experienced, trained operator identified signals, but now computers may do this.\nPassive sonar systems may have large sonic databases, but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually. A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e. the speed of a ship, or the type of weapon released), and even particular ships.\n\n\n=== Noise limitations ===\nPassive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.\nThe sonar hydrophones may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself. Towed units also combat the thermocline, as the unit may be towed above or below the thermocline.\nThe display of most passive sonars used to be a two-dimensional waterfall display. The horizontal direction of the display is bearing. The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays.\n\n\n=== Performance prediction ===\nUnlike active sonar, only one-way propagation is involved.  Because of the different signal processing used, the minimal detectable signal-to-noise ratio will be different.  The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar is\nSL \u2212 PL = NL \u2212 AG + DT,where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain and DT is the detection threshold.  The figure of merit of a passive sonar is\n\nFOM = SL + AG \u2212 (NL + DT).\n\n\n== Performance factors ==\nThe detection, classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment, as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar.\n\n\n=== Sound propagation ===\nSonar operation is affected by variations in sound speed, particularly in the vertical plane. Sound travels more slowly in fresh water than in sea water, though the difference is small.  The speed is determined by the water's bulk modulus and mass density.  The bulk modulus is affected by temperature, dissolved impurities (usually salinity), and pressure. The density effect is small.  The speed of sound (in feet per second) is approximately:\n\n4388 + (11.25 \u00d7 temperature (in \u00b0F)) + (0.0182 \u00d7 depth (in feet)) + salinity (in parts-per-thousand ).This empirically derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths. Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make up the rest of the ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.\nIf the sound source is deep and the conditions are right, propagation may occur in the 'deep sound channel'. This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel.  This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries.  Similar propagation can occur in the 'surface duct' under suitable conditions.  However, in this case there are reflection losses at the surface.\nIn shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom, where considerable losses can occur.\nSound propagation is affected by absorption in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom.  This absorption depends upon frequency, with several different mechanisms in sea water.  Long-range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects.\nThe sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature.  The main noise sources are waves and shipping.  The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed-dependent low frequency noise.\n\n\n=== Scattering ===\n\nWhen active sonar is used, scattering occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface.  This can be a major source of interference. This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car's headlights in fog: a high-intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent, but broader-beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions, much of which is scattered back to the observer, overwhelming that reflected from the target (\"white-out\").  For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimize scattering.\n\n \nThe scattering of sonar from objects (mines, pipelines, zooplankton, geological features, fish etc.) is how active sonar detects them, but this ability can be masked by strong scattering from false targets, or 'clutter'. Where they occur (under breaking waves; in ship wakes; in gas emitted from seabed seeps and leaks etc.), gas bubbles are powerful sources of clutter, and can readily hide targets. TWIPS (Twin Inverted Pulse Sonar) is currently the only sonar that can overcome this clutter problem. This is important as many recent conflicts have occurred in coastal waters, and the inability to detect whether mines are present or not present hazards and delays to military vessels, and also to aid convoys and merchant shipping trying to support the region long after the conflict has ceased.\n\n\n=== Target characteristics ===\nThe sound reflection characteristics of the target of an active sonar, such as a submarine, are known as its target strength.  A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales, wakes, schools of fish and rocks.\nPassive sonar detects the target's radiated noise characteristics.  The radiated spectrum comprises a continuous spectrum of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification.\n\n\n=== Countermeasures ===\nActive (powered) countermeasures may be launched by a submarine under attack to raise the noise level, provide a large false target, and obscure the signature of the submarine itself.\nPassive (i.e., non-powered) countermeasures include:\n\nMounting noise-generating devices on isolating devices.\nSound-absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines, for example anechoic tiles.\n\n\n== Military applications ==\nModern naval warfare makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.\nThe use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.\nSince active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.\nPassive sonar has several advantages, most importantly that it is silent. If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending on the level of noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar \"sees\" around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270\u00b0, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160\u00b0 on each side, and the towed array of a full 360\u00b0. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or ACINT.\nAnother use of passive sonar is to determine the target's trajectory. This process is called target motion analysis (TMA), and the resultant \"solution\" is the target's range, course, and speed. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases.\nPassive sonar is stealthy and very useful. However, it requires high-tech electronic components and is costly. It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection. Surface ships use it to good effect; it is even better used by submarines, and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters, mostly to a \"surprise effect\", since submarines can hide under thermal layers. If a submarine's commander believes he is alone, he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect, or go deeper and faster, and thus make more sound.\nExamples of sonar applications in military use are given below.  Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use.\n\n\n=== Anti-submarine warfare ===\n\nUntil recently, ship sonars were usually with hull mounted arrays, either amidships or at the bow.  It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required.  The first were made of canvas on a framework, then steel ones were used.  Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber.  Such sonars are primarily active in operation.  An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the SQS-56.\nBecause of the problems of ship noise, towed sonars are also used.  These also have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water.  However, there are limitations on their use in shallow water.  These are called towed arrays (linear) or variable depth sonars (VDS) with 2/3D arrays.  A problem is that the winches required to deploy/recover these are large and expensive.  VDS sets are primarily active in operation while towed arrays are passive.\nAn example of a modern active-passive ship towed sonar is Sonar 2087 made by Thales Underwater Systems.\n\n\n=== Torpedoes ===\nModern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active/passive sonar.  This may be used to home directly on the target, but wake homing torpedoes are also used.  An early example of an acoustic homer was the Mark 37 torpedo.\nTorpedo countermeasures can be towed or free.  An early example was the German Sieglinde device while the Bold was a chemical device.  A widely used US device was the towed AN/SLQ-25 Nixie while the mobile submarine simulator (MOSS) was a free device. A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system.\n\n\n=== Mines ===\nMines may be fitted with a sonar to detect, localize and recognize the required target.  An example is the CAPTOR mine.\n\n\n=== Mine countermeasures ===\nMine countermeasure (MCM) sonar, sometimes called \"mine and obstacle avoidance sonar (MOAS)\", is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects.  Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design.  An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the Type 2193 while the SQQ-32 mine-hunting sonar and Type 2093 systems are VDS designs.\n\n\n=== Submarine navigation ===\n\nSubmarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar at depth.  The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed.  Information fitted on typical fits is given in Oyashio-class submarine and Swiftsure-class submarine.\n\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n\nHelicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active-passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping sonar, such as the AQS-13.  Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy sonobuoys and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them.  Processing from the sonobuoys or dipping sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship.  Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions. Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS-20A.\n\n\n=== Underwater communications ===\nDedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication.\n\n\n=== Ocean surveillance ===\nThe United States began a system of passive, fixed ocean surveillance systems in 1950 with the classified name Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) with American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), with its Bell Laboratories research and Western Electric manufacturing entities being contracted for development and installation. The systems exploited the deep sound (SOFAR) channel and were based on an AT&T sound spectrograph, which converted sound into a visual spectrogram representing a time\u2013frequency analysis of sound that was developed for speech analysis and modified to analyze low-frequency underwater sounds. That process was Low Frequency Analysis and Recording and the equipment was termed the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder, both with the acronym LOFAR. LOFAR research was termed Jezebel and led to usage in air and surface systems, particularly sonobuys using the process and sometimes using \"Jezebel\" in their name. The proposed system offered such promise of long-range submarine detection that the Navy ordered immediate moves for implementation.\n\nBetween installation of a test array followed by a full scale, forty element, prototype operational array in 1951 and 1958 systems were installed in the Atlantic and then the Pacific under the unclassified name Project Caesar. The original systems were terminated at classified shore stations designated Naval Facility (NAVFAC) explained as engaging in \"ocean research\" to cover their classified mission. The system was upgraded multiple times with more advanced cable allowing the arrays to be installed in ocean basins and upgraded processing. The shore stations were eliminated in a process of consolidation and rerouting the arrays to central processing centers into the 1990s. In 1985, with new mobile arrays and other systems becoming operational the collective system name was changed to Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). In 1991 the mission of the system was declassified. The year before IUSS insignia were authorized for wear. Access was granted to some systems for scientific research.A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union.  \n\n\n=== Underwater security ===\n\nSonar can be used to detect frogmen and other scuba divers.  This can be applicable around ships or at entrances to ports.  Active sonar can also be used as a deterrent and/or disablement mechanism.  One such device is the Cerberus system.\n\n\n=== Hand-held sonar ===\n\nLimpet mine imaging sonar (LIMIS) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.\nThe LUIS is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.\nIntegrated navigation sonar system (INSS) is a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers that displays range.\n\n\n=== Intercept sonar ===\nThis is a sonar designed to detect and locate the transmissions from hostile active sonars.  An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British Vanguard-class submarines.\n\n\n== Civilian applications ==\n\n\n=== Fisheries ===\nFishing is an important industry that is seeing growing demand, but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems. The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of sustainability can be reached. However, the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors, sounders and sonars.  Historically, fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish. However, acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries.\nSound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.\n\nCompanies such as eSonar, Raymarine, Marport Canada, Wesmar, Furuno, Krupp, and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry. For example, net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel. Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function. Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone. The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor.\n\n\n=== Echo sounding ===\n\nEcho sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.The value of underwater acoustics to the fishing industry has led to the development of other acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo-sounders but, because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo-sounder, have been given different terms.\n\n\n=== Net location ===\nThe net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable-less net-sounder \u2013 such as Marport's Trawl Explorer \u2013 in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver-hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.\nThe display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.\nModern versions of the net sounder, using multiple element transducers, function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used.\nThe sonar is an echo-sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel.\n\n\n=== ROV and UUV ===\nSmall sonars have been fitted to remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) to allow their operation in murky conditions.  These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle.  The Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System is a UUV for MCM purposes.\n\n\n=== Vehicle location ===\nSonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea.  Short and long baseline sonars may be used for caring out the location, such as LBL.\n\n\n=== Prosthesis for the visually impaired ===\nIn 2013 an inventor in the United States unveiled a \"spider-sense\" bodysuit, equipped with ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback systems, which alerts the wearer of incoming threats; allowing them to respond to attackers even when blindfolded.\n\n\n== Scientific applications ==\n\n\n=== Biomass estimation ===\n\nDetection of fish, and other marine and aquatic life, and estimation their individual sizes or total biomass using active sonar techniques.  As the sound pulse travels through water it encounters objects that are of different density or acoustic characteristics than the surrounding medium, such as fish, that reflect sound back toward the sound source. These echoes provide information on fish size, location, abundance and behavior.  Data is usually processed and analysed using a variety of software such as Echoview.\n\n\n=== Wave measurement ===\nAn upward looking echo sounder mounted on the bottom or on a platform may be used to make measurements of wave height and period.  From this statistics of the surface conditions at a location can be derived.\n\n\n=== Water velocity measurement ===\nSpecial short range sonars have been developed to allow measurements of water velocity.\n\n\n=== Bottom type assessment ===\nSonars have been developed that can be used to characterise the sea bottom into, for example, mud, sand, and gravel. Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add-on modules, converting echo parameters into sediment type. Different algorithms exist, but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings.  Advanced substrate classification analysis can be achieved using calibrated (scientific) echosounders and parametric or fuzzy-logic analysis of the acoustic data.\n\n\n=== Bathymetric mapping ===\n\nSide-scan sonars can be used to derive maps of seafloor topography (bathymetry) by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom. Low frequency sonars such as GLORIA have been used for continental shelf wide surveys while high frequency sonars are used for more detailed surveys of smaller areas.\n\n\n=== Sub-bottom profiling ===\nPowerful low frequency echo-sounders have been developed for providing profiles of the upper layers of the ocean bottom.\n\n\n=== Gas leak detection from the seabed ===\nGas bubbles can leak from the seabed, or close to it, from multiple sources. These can be detected by both passive and active sonar (shown in schematic figure by yellow and red systems respectively). Natural seeps of methane and carbon dioxide occur. Gas pipelines can leak, and it is important to be able to detect whether leakage occurs from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities (CCSFs; e.g. depleted oil wells into which extracted atmospheric carbon is stored). Quantification of the amount of gas leaking is difficult, and although estimates can be made use active and passive sonar, it is important to question their accuracy because of the assumptions inherent in making such estimations from sonar data.\n\n\n=== Synthetic aperture sonar ===\nVarious synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine-hunting and search systems.  An explanation of their operation is given in synthetic aperture sonar.\n\n\n=== Parametric sonar ===\nParametric sources use the non-linearity of water to generate the difference frequency between two high frequencies.  A virtual end-fire array is formed. Such a projector has advantages of broad bandwidth, narrow beamwidth, and when fully developed and carefully measured it has no obvious sidelobes: see Parametric array. Its major disadvantage is very low efficiency of only a few percent.  P.J. Westervelt summarizes the trends involved.\n\n\n=== Sonar in extraterrestrial contexts ===\nUse of both passive and active sonar has been proposed for various extraterrestrial uses,. An example of the use of active sonar is in determining the depth of hydrocarbon seas on Titan, An example of the use of passive sonar is in the detection of methanefalls on Titan,It has been noted that those proposals which suggest use of sonar without taking proper account of the difference between the Earthly (atmosphere, ocean, mineral) environments and the extraterrestrial ones, can lead to erroneous values\n\n\n== Effect of sonar on marine life ==\n\n\n=== Effect on marine mammals ===\n\nResearch has shown that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals. Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, have been shown to be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar. Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar, while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins. The US Navy, which part-funded some of the studies, said that the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but they \"will evaluate the effectiveness of [their] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings\". A 2008 US Supreme Court ruling on the use of sonar by the US Navy noted that there had been no cases where sonar had been conclusively shown to have harmed or killed a marine mammal.Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation systems, sometimes called biosonar to locate predators and prey. Research on the effects of sonar on blue whales in the Southern California Bight shows that mid-frequency sonar use disrupts the whales' feeding behavior. This indicates that sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on baleen whale foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health.A review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used was published in 2019. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier's beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations. The review suggested the strength of response of individual animals may depend on whether they had prior exposure to sonar, and that symptoms of decompression sickness have been found in stranded whales that may be a result of such response to sonar.  It noted that in the Canary Islands where multiple strandings had been previously reported, no more mass strandings had occurred once naval exercises during which sonar was used were banned in the area, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur.\n\n\n=== Effect on fish ===\nHigh-intensity sonar sounds can create a small temporary shift in the hearing threshold of some fish.\n\n\n== Frequencies and resolutions ==\nThe frequencies of sonars range from infrasonic to above a megahertz. Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher frequencies offer better resolution, and smaller size for a given directionality.\nTo achieve reasonable directionality, frequencies below 1 kHz generally require large size, usually achieved as towed arrays.Low frequency sonars are loosely defined as 1\u20135 kHz, albeit some navies regard 5\u20137 kHz also as low frequency. Medium frequency is defined as 5\u201315 kHz. Another style of division considers low frequency to be under 1 kHz, and medium frequency at between 1\u201310 kHz.American World War II era sonars operated at a relatively high frequency of 20\u201330 kHz, to achieve directionality with reasonably small transducers, with typical maximum operational range of 2500 yd. Postwar sonars used lower frequencies to achieve longer range; e.g. SQS-4 operated at 10 kHz with range up to 5000 yd. SQS-26 and SQS-53 operated at 3 kHz with range up to 20,000 yd; their domes had size of approx. a 60-ft personnel boat, an upper size limit for conventional hull sonars. Achieving larger sizes by conformal sonar array spread over the hull has not been effective so far, for lower frequencies linear or towed arrays are therefore used.Japanese WW2 sonars operated at a range of frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9 kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5 kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19 kHz magnetostrictive) at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6 km. The later Type 3, with German-design magnetostrictive transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20 kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except model 1 which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The simple type used 14.5 kHz magnetostrictive transducers at 0.25 kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5 km.The sonar's resolution is angular; objects further apart are imaged with lower resolutions than nearby ones.\nAnother source lists ranges and resolutions vs frequencies for sidescan sonars. 30 kHz provides low resolution with range of 1000\u20136000 m, 100 kHz gives medium resolution at 500\u20131000 m, 300 kHz gives high resolution at 150\u2013500 m, and 600 kHz gives high resolution at 75\u2013150 m. Longer range sonars are more adversely affected by nonhomogenities of water. Some environments, typically shallow waters near the coasts, have complicated terrain with many features; higher frequencies become necessary there.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDring, Thomas R.

        "wiki": "The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is a museum located in Heraklion on Crete. It is one of the greatest museums in Greece and the best in the world for Minoan art, as it contains the most notable and complete collection of artefacts of the Minoan civilization of Crete.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe museum began in 1883 as a simple collection of antiquities. A dedicated building was constructed from 1904 to 1912 at the instigation of two Cretan archaeologists, Iosif Hatzidakis and Stefanos Xanthoudidis. After three destructive earthquakes in 1926, 1930, and 1935, the museum nearly collapsed. The director of the Heraklion Museum was then Spyridon Marinatos, who made great efforts to find funds and persuade the locals and the central government alike that a new solid building was needed. In 1935, Marinatos succeeded in engaging Patroklos Karantinos to build a sturdy structure that has withstood both natural disasters and the bombing that accompanied the German invasion in 1941. Although the museum was damaged during World War II, the collection survived intact and again became accessible to the public in 1952. A new wing was added in 1964.\nThe Herakleion Archaeological Museum is one of the largest and most important museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. It houses representative artifacts from all the periods of Cretan prehistory and history, covering a chronological span of over 5,500 years from the Neolithic period to Roman times. The singularly important Minoan collection contains unique examples of Minoan art, many of them true masterpieces. The Heraklion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.\nThe museum is located in the town centre. It was built between 1937 and 1940 by architect Patroklos Karantinos on a site previously occupied by the Roman Catholic monastery of Saint-Francis which was destroyed by earthquake in 1856. The museum's antiseismic building is an important example of modernist architecture and was awarded a Bauhaus commendation. Karantinos applied the principles of modern architecture to the specific needs of a museum by providing good lighting from the skylights above and along the top of the walls, and facilitating the easy flow of large groups of people. He also anticipated future extensions to the museum. The colours and construction materials, such as the veined polychrome marbles, recall certain Minoan wall-paintings which imitate marble revetment. The two-storeyed building has large exhibition spaces, laboratories, a drawing room, a library, offices and a special department, the so-called Scientific Collection, where numerous finds are stored and studied. The museum shop, run by the Archaeological Receipts Fund, sells museum copies, books, postcards and slides. There is also a caf\u00e9.\nMost of the museum was closed for renovation from 2006 and reopened in May 2013.The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is a Special Regional Service of the Ministry of Culture and its purpose is to acquire, safeguard, conserve, record, study, publish, display and promote Cretan artefacts from the Prehistoric to the Late Roman periods. The museum organizes temporary exhibitions in Greece and abroad, collaborates with scientific and scholarly institutions, and houses a variety of cultural events.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Room I ===\nCovers findings from 6000 BCE to the pre-Palatial period, including:\n\nNeolithic fertility goddess\nVasiliki ware\nstone jars from the island of Mochlos\nminiature clay sculptures\n\n\n=== Room II ===\nCovers findings from 2000 BCE to 1700 BCE in Knossos, Malia and several peak sanctuaries, including:\n\nKamares ware pottery\nglazed plaques of Minoan houses (aka the \"Town Mosaic\")\npeak sanctuary figurines\n\n\n=== Room III ===\nPhaistos Disc\nKamares ware pottery\n\n\n=== Room IV ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1450 BCE, including:\n\nbull's head rhyton from Knossos\nsnake goddess figurines\ntools and weapons, mostly cast in bronze\ncups with Linear A inscriptions\n\n\n=== Room V ===\nCovers findings from 1450 BCE to 1400 BCE, including:\n\nancient Egyptian trade objects\nclay model of a house\nexamples of a Linear A and Linear B scripts\n\n\n=== Room VI ===\nCovers findings from cemeteries at Knossos, Phaistos and Archanes, including:\n\nclay figurines\ngold jewellery\nhorse burial from a tholos tomb at Archanes\n\n\n=== Room VII ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1300 BCE from smaller villas and sacred caves, including:\n\nbronze double axes\nthe \"Harvesters Vase\"\nsteatite vases from Hagia Triada\ngold jewelry from Malia\n\n\n=== Room VIII \u2013 Zakros ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1450 BCE from the palace of Zakros, including:\n\nrock crystal rhyton\nbull's head rhyton\npottery with floral and marine motifs\n\n\n=== Room IX ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1450 BCE in eastern Crete, including:\n\nterracotta figurines from Pisokephalo peak sanctuary\nseal stones\n\n\n=== Room X \u2013 Mycenaean ===\nCovers findings from 1400 BCE to 1100 BCE, including:\n\nclay figurines\nclay sculpture of dancers with a lyre player\n\n\n=== Room XI \u2013 Dorian ===\nCovers findings from 1100 BCE to 900 BCE during the arrival of the Dorian Greeks, including:\n\nweapons and tools, mostly of iron\nclay fertility figurines\nvotive offerings\n\n\n=== Room XII ===\nCovers findings up to 650 BCE, including:\n\npottery decorated with griffins\nartefacts and figurines from Kato Syme\n\n\n=== Room XIII \u2013 Larnakes ===\nMinoan larnakes (clay coffins) are on display here.\n\n\n=== Room XIV \u2013 Hall of the Frescoes ===\nFrescoes from Knossos and Hagia Triada\nThe Hagia Triada sarcophagus\n\n\n=== Room XV & Room XVI ===\nMore frescoes, including the famous \"La Parisienne\"\n\n\n=== Room XX \u2013 Classical Greek, Greco-Roman ===\nSculptures from Classical Greek and Greco-Roman periods\n\n\n== Visitor information ==\nThe museum is open April\u2013September, Monday 12\u20137pm Tuesday\u2013Sunday 8am\u20137pm, October\u2013March daily 8am\u20135pm.\nEU students can receive a discounted entry.\nThere is air conditioning within the building.\nSome of the collection cannot be photographed due to publication or another reason.

          "Good museum, especially in combination with the Knossos palast. Under 25 years you don\u2019t have to pay",
          "If you are at all interested in ancient greek history, visiting this museum is a must in my opinion. It is very well labeled and the exhibits are well presented. The building and the exhibitions rooms are very modern. We had only one hour there, which was not enough, but better",
          "On just two stories near the central place in Heraklion you get to meet 2.000 years of history, with a couple of very famous pieces, a lot of important originals, in a very modern and bright architecture and with a lot of information. Even if you have only one hour of spare",
          "We visited the museum on our day at Heraklion. It\u2019s a nice set up with a lot of ancious stuff like coins, plates, jewelry, sculptures and old history I would not go there with small kids as it\u2019s more like an \u201cadult thing\u201d and you need to be interested in history But we liked",
          "Wonderful collection, a must see in Crete together with the Jnossos palace compelx site, very rich collection, prepare from history",
          "Crete is a credle of civilization. The museum offers good overview on the history of this amazing island and is definitely great addition to your visit in Heraklion.",
          "Excellent and comprehensive museum. Allow at least 2 hours to enjoy the exhibits. Covid safe,masks and no of visitorsper room closely observed. Well worth a visit",
          "Even though my husband claimed he had seen enough pottery for a long time he enjoyed the exhibits as well. This museum presents a look into 7000 years of Crete civilization and is a must to visit! We spent almost 2 hours there because so many items are worth to be looked at",
          "We were amazed at the quality and amount of exhibits on display, in this museum. Artefacts in the region of 4000 years old the designs of which almost seemed so modern...shows what we borrow and take inspiration from the past. It does feel a long walk around on a hot day but",
          "We bought the combo tickets for Knossos Palace and this museum which I would recommend anyone with an interest in archeology and history to visit. Amazing collection of items in chronological order, some of which had been made around 5000 BC (pretty mind blowing). Excellent",
          "WARNING!!! IF YOU BUY ONLINE, THEN PRINT YOUR TICKETS OUT BEFORE GOING! I purchased online a combi ticket with Knossos and hired a car. Started at Knossos and went around no problem. Was taking pictures and suddenly my phone screen went blank. I could not access anything on my",
          "A museum you can't miss! So rich collections, so many iconic master pieces, specially for those who like archeology. I suggest to make it in the afternoon, after visiting Knossos palace (and I suggest the combo ticket which is so valuable)",
          "Excellent set up - lots and lots to see so good to have a read a guide to get you to the key exhibits",
          "Nothing to say apart that the collections are splendid and varied. Make sense with nearly 4000 years history. About details, do not book cut the line tickets on the tripadvisor as it is expensive and worthless. Had to call the operator to get the tickets and the desk lady",
          "It is worth a trip to see so much and if for nothing else but see the 3000 year old bee pendent. This old Chao found it mesmerising.",
          "Wonderful collection of ancient artifacts. I spent the entire day here, as there were so many interesting exhibits, and nearly every exhibit had an accompanying description that helped me understand the context. Of course the phaistos disc is a must-see, and there were also lots",
          "This museum had good, although time consuming, COVID protocols in place. When we finally got to see the exhibitions they were very detailed and there were a lot of them. Do allow plenty of time to get round them all. We possibly made the mistake of spending too much time looking",
          "It's an archeological museum like an other at an other ancient archeological site. Please do not missunderstand: you will see exhibits, of wich you neuer thought people 6000 years ago would have used it. But we've missed anything about the usage, the traditional live, the urban",
          "beautiful collections of Minoan and Greek artefacts, lots in very good shape.. lots of vases and amphoraes.. some impressive clay coffins.. museum is very large and require a 2 hours visit .. entrance can be combined with Knossos palace if you buy the ticket in the museum only..",
          "Good museum with a simple layout focusing on displaying as many of the Minoan (and later) artifacts as possible. I'd say its aimed at adults, not a lot for kids to see or do. Not a lot of interpretive art or reconstruction, you are left to visit Knossos for that. In mid August",
          "After Knossos palace you must go to visit the museum with a lot of micenean vessels and much more. The museum is big on 2 floors and you need at least 3 hours to visit completely.",
          "This museum holds a spectacular collection. The gallery\u2019s are modern, well laid out and have good bilingual labels. We booked online and arrived early. Really good social distancing in place with very low visitors allowed in at one time. Can not recommend enough!",
          "Nice museum. Worth going to. More explanation of content would help but the film was good. Staff very friendly",
          "To breathe an authentic atmosphere about the history of Crete, you cannot miss a visit to this very interesting museum. Duration of the visit is almost two hours. I suggest to combine the visit with the Cnosso Palace; it is also possible to buy the combined ticket.",
          "This would have been an informative and enjoyable trip if I did not have the children with me. The security guards clearly did not want the children there and constantly reprimanded them for making a noise or for pointing a finger at a glass case and, heaven forbid, had the",
          "Really impressive museum intelligently presenting how the minoean culture was subtile and influenced all the Mediterranean world. The museography is one of the most modern and smart I saw in Europe and US. Do not hesitate to visit !",
          "Great place to learn about the culture of this beautiful place. It was quite busy and places to eat are limited when we went.",
          "Very nice/wide collection that displays the complete history of Crete. Also, for people under 25, entrance is free!",
          "Excellently organized museum! We bought combined tickets with Knossos palace and the whole package gives you wonderful insight into minoan culture. We did some pre-reads with children, especially ancient stories about myths connected with Knossos, Crete (i.e. Minotaur) and we",
          "The Heraklion Archeological Museum has an excellent collection of artefacts from the Minoan (ca. 1700 BC) civilisation which predates that of classical Greece. The collection includes pottery, jewellery, coins, mosaics, frescoes, statues and weapons and is the ideal complement",
          "Before you go to Knossos, you must visit this excellent museum. It puts the excavations in context and opens up the fascinating world of Minoan cu!ture. Well laid out - allow plenty of time to appreciate the wealth of artefacts displayed here.",
          "I can\u2019t imagine not going to this museum. It\u2019s terrific Knossos was disappointing and I knew it would be but this is why I came Greatest Minoan artifacts in the world are here I even went back it was so good",
          "I was blown away by the intricacy and beauty of many of these relics from Crete's ancient past. Well worth the time when you're in Heraklion.",
          "For antiquarians, the Athens museum should be the best. But I personally was thrilled more by the massive Heraklion Museum--and be prepared to spend at least three hours here--for several reasons. First, Knossos, well worth a visit, was pretty-well Disney-ed up 110 years ago by",
          "Tons of interesting artifacts from Neolithic through Roman periods with good explanations in English. And the snake goddess! We spent over 3 hours and could have honestly stayed longer but the museum was closing.",
          "A wonderfull museum of all the artifacts recovered from Knossos and other locations in Crete. Easy to find at the east edge of the old city and medium size venue with all the displays well shown and explained. Includes the not to be missed Phaistos disc. Head phone and guded",
          "One of the greatest collections that I have seen from a local museum so far. The history of this island zipped in there \ud83d\ude04",
          "a wide variety of artefacts, beautifully presented and notated. Well worth visiting. The building itself was worth a visit.",
          "Spent 3 hours here, very well presented and enlightening, amazing. Then took a taxi up the road and spent 30 minutes at Knossos Palace site,.. that says it all really.",
          "A beautiful museum, with a wonderful collection! You can really learn a lot about the early civilizations! Spacious, clean and with a friendly staff! You must visit!",
          "A must visit when in Crete. All exhibits are amazing. Primarly from the Minoan Civilization period. Honestly one of world\u2019s best museums.",
          "Visit this amazing museum after your visit to the knossis site to getter understand some of the stunning artefacts displayed. Beautifully displayed visiting this museum gives one real insight into the Minoan civilization. Definitely recommend.",
          "The museum had the entire 2nd floor closed the day we visited. Yes, it was posted but there definitely should have been a discount price that day. All the Creten frescoes and Roman pieces weren't available for viewing. It was a short visit for the rainy day we stopped in on. The",
          "To think we almost missed this one. At the end of our trip we had overdosed on museums and almost didn't see this. Out guide at the Palace of Knossos recommended that we not miss this and she was right! Absolutely stunning exhibit items and more meaningful after having viewed",
          "Extensive collection from prehistoric, Minoan to Roman. We went on a guided tour arranged by our cruise ship and saw the highlights of the extensive collection. Not to be missed attraction if one is interested in the history of Crete.",
          "All the history of the Minoan civilazation is presented in a unique way. Commerce, war, art, every day life, religion and burial customs.",
          "Modern and well presented. Cafe not open on the day we visited. Busy even out of the main holiday season.",
          "New museum, great location, \u00e0 LOT to see, all the history in front of your eyes. A must see, takes less than 2 hours to look around some of the most famous antiques.",
          "It is not like you have a choice if you are in Heraklion. You visit the Temple of Knossos and all the original stuff was moved to the museum. But I bet the really awesome stuff went to London with Evans. So to sum up the experience. This place is clean and well maintained but I",
          "This museum has a collection that dates back several thousand years. The displays explain the ancient history of Crete starting with the Minoans. A walk down history lane.",
          "If you plan to visit just one museum on Crete, choose this one! It is extremely interesting - we learned a lot about the cultures living on and forming Crete som 3-4000 years ago. There are very many finds from Knossos and other cretan cultures. Should you have the opportunity,",
          "We were only able to see the highlights of the Museum, but it was all wonderful and well displayed. There is so much to see and it is organised so you can get a taste of different developments of time.",
          "A wealth of exquisite objects beautifully displayed. Allow a whole morning, afternoon or even the whole day to fully enjoy this museum. Definitely a must!",
          "Well over 10 centuries of super interesting Minoan cultural information. Loads of history in this place, and at 6 euros it's not a bad price either. Check it out while you're in Heraklion before you go to Knossos.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. It was easy to find and well sign posted. Security was tight but I was quite happy not dragging my bag around with me. I found the layout easy to navigate and the information easily accessible in that there were plenty of English translation",
          "There is a lot to see here but a combined ticket with Knossos (one visit each - valid three days) is extremely good value and it is worth spending time on the exhibits of particular interest rather than try and see everything",
          "Hi all, Sorry I know my title seems a bit over the top but I've been to a lot of museums and really love Heraklion archeological museum,not only have they a massive and well-preserved/revelant collection but the layout is the Best I ever saw. We've been there with a friend",
          "This large museum has well documented written information in Greek and English to educate the viewer of the historical era the displayed artifacts are from. The number of items in the collection is massive, and could take up to a couple hours to view if you are interested in",
          "This really is a must see. Ensure that you have allotted enough time. I really enjoyed the chronological layout of the different rooms. The written guides introducing a room and the details of the objects really helped understand this most fascinating epoc of Grecian history",
          "Excellent layout in chronological order and all well displayed and labelled. Would definetly recommend a visit.",
          "Very modern building, very good explanations. The display is on two floors. There is a nice outside area with a gorgeous view of the city from a terrace. A must when in Heraklion.",
          "We visited this museum as we wanted to see the artefacts from Knossos which we had visited earlier that day. There is plenty to see and the displays have information in English which is helpful. For adults who are interested in the history of the artefacts it is a great museum,",
          "Having visited the archaeological site in the morning it was interesting to visit this museum to see so many of the artifacts found at the Palace. Would recommend having a guide to make the most of it",
          "After visiting Knossos we also visited the museum to see all the things our guide in Knossos was referring to. Many things to see if a remarkable period.",
          "I've had the fortune to visit the Heraklion Archaeological Museum twice now and hope to get to visit again! The collection and displays are incredible. I could spend hours looking at the highlights and also every item in the museum is exquisite.",
          "Look for the model of the Palace of Knossos to see the sheer size of the place. There are many different exhibits in this museum and it is well worth it to take your time to see all that is included.",
          "Well worth a visit! An incredible amount of artefacts on display. Visit here before going to Knossos as it will help to identify certain aspects.",
          "Very good museum to see lots of ancient Crete art: lots of pots, jewels, figurines, weapons, sarcophagus, wall paintings. Very modern layout, very clean, a proper museum. Recommended to buy the tickets when doing the joint visit with Knossos palace as it is only \u20ac1 additional.",
          "We loved this museum, great explanations in English and Greek, well laid out, you walk through time as the museum rooms go from the oldest ancient artifacts to the more recent ones. It was so neat to read about and see the everything. It's amazing how advanced they were, their",
          "This was a great thing to so after spending the morning at Knossos Palace. Their collection was beautifully displayed and curated. We were sorry some of the rooms upstairs were closed. A must see when Heraklion.",
          "Whether traveling with family or not, the museums is a spectacular place to visit. Due to the high volume of the exhibits we would recommend a guided tour so you will not miss all the extraordinary details and the historical facts of the ancient history of Crete",
          "Great museum, most items are well laid out and there is interpretation. A woman goes around cleaning the glass as soon as someone has gone near an exhibit which isn't very nice for the guests to inhale all the cleaning fluid! But definitely worth a visit",
          "Great Museum, especially compared to other Greek museums. The exhibits are labeled and ordered for a nice visit",
          "Truely amazing exhibits nicely set out & shown to great effect. To think that most of the exhibits are potentially 4000 years old shows how advanced & capable the Minoan people were. When we visited there was a queue to get in & through security, but overall it was pretty easy",
          "This must be on of the best museums I have ever visited. Displays are well catalogued with information in Greek and English. Starts with prehistoric Crete and move closer to the present. Highlights are the reconstruction of Knossos, the bull head and the goddess holding snakes.",
          "We drove trough old ruins for a few days Knossos, Gortyna, Phaistos, Agia Triada, Tylissos. So on the third day from Knossos (we bought a combo ticket Knossos-Museum), we found time to visit the museum. It was so much more meaningful to look at the artefacts, because we already",
          "Walked there from the port comfortably. Cost was only EUR16 for a combination ticket including Knossos Palace. The museum is packed with exhibited items - about 15 rooms full. You could spend hours looking through the Minoan artifacts. Well documented and signed in English.",
          "I was overwhelmed by the well organized and comprehensive collection in the fairly new museum on Crete. I rivals the Greece Archaeological Museum in Athens. It is close to the City center and would suggest you plan on 2-3 hours for your visit. You won't be disappointed.",
          "This museum is spectauclarly laid out.......beginning in the late Stone Age and moving up through the age of the Minoans, and finishing in the Classical age. But it is the Minoan artifacts that are just overwhelmingly beautiful, abundant, marvelously described and laid out so",
          "I loved the exhibits in this museum - yes, the staff could learn to be more courteous and less like guards, but considering the priceless objects that they are \"guarding\" perhaps it is understandable. You have to be keen on archaeology to appreciate the finds - I went twice as",
          "Loved the museum with much art work as well as artifacts. This has been my favorite museum so far in Greece. You can purchase a dual ticket for Knossis",
          "It\u2019s one of the best museums in the world. The perfect introduction to Minoan culture. Thank You!!!!!!",
          "We went four times to finish it all. I admit that we look at everything and read it all. Well worth the time if you want to see everything. Sometimes after three or four hours I get museum overload and have to have time to process. There is so much in the museum starting",
          "Fantastic museum with some really interesting pieces. The thing that let it down was the continuous hissing and shhing from the museum attendants towards particularly small children. Even more annoying when they then spoke amongst themselves loudly. I wasn\u2019t aware you had to be",
          "As a tourist experience, Knossos is both wonderful and terrible at the same time. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have visited this museum first. It is superbly laid out (starting from the oldest to the 'newest'), with lots of explanatory material which is always",
          "This is a must see - it has all the treasures of the Knossos Palace and so much more. Beautifully laid out, lots of information. Go early because the tour buses come later and it is sometimes hard to see things or contemplate the exhibits with guides rattling on!",
          "We didn't manage to see all of the exhibits in two to three hours, the dual entry ticket with Knossos ticket is very good value at 16 euros against 10 and 15 respectively, it's valid for three days, we tried to go back to the museum after visiting Knossos and found that while",
          "Pottery, paintings, mosaics, sculptures, old metalwork (Swords, coins and such) You are not allowed to bring in any liquids that may damage anything, after a tourist sprayed a painting with perfume and damaged it. You must check in anything that is banned at the cloakroom just",
          "Fascinating collection over 2 floors of Minoan history and artifacts. Fully refurbished exhibition halls and excellent display cabinets. Great supporting detail. If you visit Knossos you need to visit the museum. Well worth it.",
          "We went to the museum on the first day of our visit before going to the Knossos archeological site. Unlike Knossos, which was quite disappointimg with its deceiving restoration works, the Archeological museum was great. It gives precise historical background of the Minoan and",
          "There is a great vast amount of artifacts at this museum. She much is unknown about the minoan people that thrived at this location more than 3,600 years ago. It\u2019s amazing how advanced the people were and what they had accomplished. Anyone that goes to Crete must visit this",
          "Spent 1.5 hours in the. Museum, a stunning collection, visit before you go to Knossos. Some of the artefacts take your breath away, clean toilets and a good museum shop.",
          "Nice museum with a great collection in out and indoor displays. Tells a lot about Crete's history. We had a Nice day.",
          "Not 100%sure about restorations but glad it is there so you get a feel of the magnificance of a palace that is 3600 years old. Do go at 8 sharp to avoid the cruise ship tour buses..or maybe later in the day. We got there at 9 and too many tours. Anyways site is large so you can",
          "Many of the important Cretan relics are at this museum. The layout is logical, but the text on the walls are too small, or, worse yet, partially missing. Overall, it is a must-see if you wish to understand Crete\u2019s history",
          "Thus helped get rid the bitter experience if the concrete Knossos. The layout and variety of exhibits was brilliant. The intuitive and spacious layout made navigation easy.",
          "2nd best in Greece, after the Archeological Museum of Athens. Far more interesting than the Acropolis Museum of Athens. You don't even need a guide to visit. All you have to do is to read the explanation of the exhibits.",
          "The museum is in the centre of Heraklion. It\u2019s treasures are beautifully displayed and the layout is explained very well. We spent a fascinating 3 hours there.",
          "Went in arround 10 am. ..... Just so much to see from the earliest times of Greek and especially the Minoan civilisations for anybody with any interest in history and/or archaeology ..... surprised to find had been in there for nearly FOUR hours ....... I think that says it",
          "Having visited many of the Minoan archaeological sites around Crete which point out that all the artefacts discovered are stored at this museum, it was time to put everything together and see the discoveries. Not a necessity, but seeing one site probably helps make sense of the",
          "The richest, in exhibits, archaeological museum in the world for the greatest known civilisation that has ever existed on earth.",
          "An absolute must. We spent 3 hrs. Late afternoon till closing. Very close to our hotel, infinity boutique hotel. Amazing after going to knosses that morning. Seeing artifacts 4000BC.",
          "All of the major archeological finds from the palace of Knossos are housed in this museum. The Minoan civilization was extraordinary and the presentation of the pieces in this museum will convince you how extraordinary they were.",
          "A great place to see artifacts from history many of which have not been officially catalogued. A cool and spacious area to wander around and pass the time. Fascinating stories in every room . Just go,stroll round and enjoy the experience",
          "Recommended. The museum can be visited via an extra euro add on from a Knossos trip so good value. Lots of pots and jewelry and the famous Pareus disk.",
          "The Museum is well worth seeing. The collection exposed is beautiful and interesting also for an amateur. The posters in English explains the artefacts in an understandable way and adds meat to the bones when you visit the Palace in Knossos. If you are planning for your end",
          "We purchased a joint Knossos and archeological museum ticket so we didn\u2019t have to queue to buy one. We did have to queue to have our bags scanned, which was a bit frustrating (one scanner and LOTS of people waiting). Once inside there is a cloakroom if you don\u2019t want to carry",
          "The displays are arranged chronologically by room. This really helps in getting clearer picture of the ancient history of the island. Besides the famous artifacts like the Phaestos Disk I liked the wooden reconstruction of the Palace of Knossos. At the actual site I had a hard",
          "This is a one of the best little museums I've visited. I was entranced by the selection of pottery, small seals,statuary and other relics in this museum. I found it well curated, with good English descriptions. If you are interested in all the minutiae of ancient Minoan life,",
          "The Archaeological Museum of Heraklion is a must see in Crete . The volume of visitors inside the museum further confirms the huge interest in the Minoan art and culture this museum has on display . 1-3 hours are needed if you really want to see all the exhibits especially when",
          "It was hard to get the age of all these remarkable treasures fixed in ones head. They are SO old! What an extraordinary collection of artifacts in amazingly good condition. i am not a great one for dusty museums, but this one was mind-blowingly spectacular! The gold jewelry was",
          "Despite crowds from cruise boats, the visit went smoothly. The collection is astonishing, and beautifully curated. The building is impressive, and leads you through ancient history with clear and helpfulmexplanations. A great museum.",
          "This place contains everything of value that has been excavated in the island in the last two hundred years. Very well presented.",
          "It's nice to get inside from the heat... But it's nice and lot of Greek history. And if you are lucky you will see maybe 1 or 2 vases. It's good place to go to, and worth it",
          "We visited the museum after a visit to the Palace of Knossos with a little trepidation as we were disappointed with the Palace ruins and information about the history of the site. In my opinion a visit to the museum should be before the Palace of Knossos to fully understand this",
          "After a visit to Knossos Palace this museum is a must where all the details of the Minoan civilization come alive. See art, jewelry, pottery, religious artifacts and burial coffins. Amazing stuff from an ancient civilization. The museum is not large and you can complete a visit",
          "Wonderful collection of Minoan material, very well displayed and with a lot of explanatory English text. Fascinating pottery, implements and tools, stunning jewellery. Absolutely well worth seeing; we certainly learned a lot. An enormous amount to see - two visits would be great",
          "Too much See twice on several days is a good option Amazing Amazing Amazing Need to see it\u2019s the root of European no WORLD civilization! The museum has stuff from more before Christ then 2019 years.... Really excellent Value of entrance is 10\u20ac but free last weekend of",
          "You can see there many things. Great who intrested at history. Also good for kids, there are some entertainment for them. Minuses that some things are not working and the price is 7,5e",
          "Nice and inexpensive during the off season. No crowds and exhibition s show well. Very informative, too.",
          "It's a museum....what else do I say. Contains some of the artifacts from Knossos (plus lots of other stuff), and provides history of the area. I believe there was a discount if you bought a combined ticket for the archaeological site. Public bus to the site leaves from just",
          "You should of course visit the archeological site of Knossos, but to understand and get the context: This museum is fantastic. Beautiful and intrigueing objects, a lot to learn. If I had to choose between this and seeing the Palace of Knossos: My first priority would defnitely",
          "Excellent museum. Not too long to visit, but the exhibits are all worth the time to see. Try to arrive early before the large tour groups. 1100 should do it.",
          "The Heraklion Archeological Museum was one of the most pleasant surprises of our visit to Crete. The museum is beautiful, well designed, well laid out, and has an amazing collection of Minoan artifacts. All the displays had full descriptions in both Greek and English. Also, the",
          "Bought as part of the Knossos ticket,this museum houses artifacts found at Knossos and other sites across the island. Well worth a visit if your a history buff.",
          "Well organized and informative. Only complaint is there is so much at some point I did not want to see another pot or sculpture.",
          "Great collection of Minoan piece of arts. The visit us definitely complementary to Knossos palace since most of pieces found there are displayed herr! Also good coverage of Greek Roman and bizantine history",
          "Absolute 5 stars on a Saturday if you kick it off before 0830. We spent three hours and could have easily spent longer. So much to see, and very well laid out and informative ... then the bus loads of cruise-ship tourists arrive, clearly on pack-it-all-in timelines in guided",
          "This is in the heart of Heraklion so combine it with visiting the town centre. The museum is a modern facility with plenty of space to see the huge number of exhibits from through the ages. It\u2019s the only place to see the original wall frescoes from Knossos too. You get a very",
          "Incredibly informative displays and clearly treasured and precious; beautiful artefacts of interest and provide quite amazing insight into the civilisation - if it\u2019s a guided tour, be careful that it\u2019s not rushed as there is so much to see and you are in danger of \u2018skipping\u2019",
          "Our guide escorted us around the museum pointing out the most interesting exhibits. The frescoes were amazing as was the pottery.",
          "There can\u2019t be many places that cover the consequences and artefacts of such a long period of human history, or of so many different epochs and cultures. This museum really is everything you might expect and more and, whether or not you also make a parallel visit to Knossos or",
          "Excellent museum. Great place to discover the Minoan civilization. Fascinating place! Have at least 2 hours to see the place. You can buy the tickets of Knoss",
          "We only decided to go to this museum at the last minute and were really glad that we did not miss it. The exhibits are beautifully displayed, well explained and in fact the whole museum is a bit of a work of art in itself. We loved it.",
          "Small so easy to get around. Interesting exhibits. What we expected. Walked straight past it, whilst trying to find it.",
          "It is really worth to get the combined ticket for Knossos Palace and this museum for 1\u20ac extra, instead of the 10\u20ac you would pay to visit it. Around 1.5, 2h is enough for a visit. Well organized museum with an excellent collection.",
          "We spent the whole afternoon here as there was so much to see, with incredible artefacts and displays. It stays open until 8pm so there is time to do both Knossos Palace and the museum on the same day - although the joint ticket is valid for 3 days so you don\u2019t have to see them",
          "The main reason I came to Heraklion was to visit this museum. The building is nothing much, the cafe was closed, the gift shop is boring BUT the collection is incredible. Took me 4 hours as it was just so interesting. Guides you along the timeline of the civilisations and how",
          "Once you have seen the semi-reconstructed palace, you need to see the actual artifacts that were used as the basis for the reconstruction. I saw many artifacts that I have seen pictures of in textbooks and articles. The museum is not large and covers the Minoan civilization",
          "I visited this museum as part of the Knossos palace tour and our guide, Suki, was brilliant. Definitely recommended",
          "We visited the museum and it\u2019s not very big, however had very ancient and interesting artifacts. They are open until 8pm.",
          "I've been to many museums all over Europe, and this would easily be in my list of must sees. It is a treasure trove of finds from Knossos and other sites. The preservation of some artefacts is extraordinary, beautiful statues that pre-date almost all other finds outside of",
          "Amazing treasures from the Minoan Palace at Knossos are displayed in this museum . Beautiful ceramics ! One of the centerpiece is a Minoan athelet jumping over a raging bull , really fascinating ! Well worth a visit !",
          "The Minoan collection of artifacts is stunning and huge. A must see in Heraklion. Highlights: the miniature of Knossos Palace, the disk, the original frescoes . . . how many octopi can you count?",
          "We enjoyed this museum very much and learned so much about the Minoans. There are excellent signs in English. It\u2019s not huge to overwhelm either, just the right size. We went to the Knossos palace afterwards and wish we\u2019d skipped that and just visited the museum instead. The",
          "After taking a tour through the ruins, the tourist guide recommend to visit the museum. The museum have a lot of great argueologies exposition. Is a great place to complement your visit at the ruins. With the same ticked, you visit both places",
          "Visited on a Tui tour with a local guide who will pick out the highlights. Lots to see but a couple of hours will suffice unless you're really into archaeology. A lot of unusual artefacts such as jewellery, everyday ancient objects and coffin/bath tubs (you'll find out!!).",
          "Give yourself at least an hour to explore the collections in this museum, which originate from Knossos and other Minoan settlements. If you\u2019ve already visited Knossos, the wooden model depicting how the palace would have looked like during its heyday will be of particular",
          "We have already been to Knossos before but didn't get the chance to visit the museum. This time around we paid one euro extra at knossos for admission to the museum, and it was one will spent. We spent the whole day there and didn't leave until late. The museum is very well",
          "There are some intresting pices on display here but there are alos LOTS of diffrent types of jugs and storage containerd so it become a bit dull after a while. And the staff is always on edge , sure it is understandabel but it still makes you feel uncomfortable to have the",
          "A good way to learn more about the time before the Greeks and Romans. Because I didn\u2019t know much about this it was surely interesting. Also nice arranged everything and clear presentation. A bit too much emphasis on the 15th - 13th century BC though.",
          "After visiting the palace we stop and used our ticket again for the museum. I am personally not into museums, but I enjoyed the model of the palace and the mystery coin display.",
          "If you are on Crete this is must see. My family visited Minoan Night Experience, then Knossos palace and after Heraklion Archaeological Museum. It is all connected. And those old artifacts adds to the mosaic of deep cultural understanding of ancient civilization. Minoans were",
          "It\u2019s a relatively compact museum stuffed with archaeological treasures, mainly from Minoan time. Incredible collection. You can zoom through fast or take your time. There are lots of large groups coming through which could slow down The museum book store has a pour collection",
          "Excellent museum! It provides great historical lessons and context for the items on display and lays them out in such a way that you can walk through history and see the progression of technology from the early Bronze Age up to the early Iron Age. Interesting historical",
          "We went here directly after seeing the palace of Knossos. IT was amazing to see all of the original finds from there. So well presented and very informative also. Very nice extension to the guide tour from Knossos.",
          "Wow, what a great museum, really didn't expect to enjoy it as much, but I did! Fantastic display, well labelled and organised and certainly very well staffed. The only thing is that the staff seemed a bit over the top in terms of their extremely strict attitude if anyone even",
          "If you choose to visit Knossos, it is definitively worth combining the visit to the ruins with this museum, which actually displays the original works of arts, including frescoes, which were collected from Knossos archaeological site. It is just amazing to see what works of art",
          "The exhibits are excellent and laid out well (in date order so you can see the development over time), but the descriptions on the walls alongside (only in Greek or English) have lost some of the letters/words and are quite hard to read, even for a native English speaker - no",
          "Go and visit! Don't think about it. This will tell you so much about the civilizations in Crete and their lives.",
          "Really interesting museum. Really worth a visit. Due to government cuts and a lack of staff we were not allowed to view the mosaics which was really disappointing.",
          "Good artifacts. Small museum. Well organized. Actually preferred to the museum in Athens. Try and visit the archeological sites in the cool if the day. It's quite a trek and then come relax in the cool of museum.",
          "I was very impressed by the way the museum is organised. All labelled in Greek and English. The frescos and sculptures are well displayed. However, I got a bit overdosed on the pottery.",
          "This museum is fantastic. It's home to the most incredible collection of Minoan art and artifacts and is absolutely worth visiting. Highly recommended!!",
          "The museum has 10 of thousands of archeological artefacts. There was no audio guide and it was this difficult to enjoy or assimilate this historic treasure trove - great shame. The curators in attendance were not very helpful - additional statues with no purpose\ud83e\udd13The phaitos",
          "Big history and monuments. Love to have that experience in crete ,athens and santorini . Greece has so many interesting historical museums to enjoy . Do it",
          "decided last minute to go to the museum - glad we did. Kids enjoyed and learned so much about the culture. the museum is very clean, knowledgeable information being provided for Greek history. Definitely worth to go!",
          "Wonderful experience, we didn\u2019t realise the extensive history of Crete and in particular the beautiful collection of Minoan Art and its historical significance!",
          "A true walk back through the history of the island and it\u2019s inhabitants, take your time, check all the cases and you will get the full experience",
          "There are so many amazing artefacts! You cannot miss this museum if one visits Heraklion.The beauty of this city does not mean only beaches,sightseeings but also its stunning history that makes it unique!",
          "Me and my boyfriend had a plan to visit the museum but the staff doesn\u2019t take isic ID for a student discounts. Very disappointed.",

          "This museum is world class with an amazing selection and big amount of pieces. Very impressive selection, and you can easily use 2-3 hours here, navies it is so well labeled. If you have small children keep an extra eye on them since several objects are in reach of",
          "Crete is said to be the birthplace of Europe. After seeing the incredible finds from Knossos I can understand why. If you have any interest in the history of Greece, this museum is a must-see combined with Temple Knossos. The museum helped place into context what we had just",
          "If you have any interest in the history of Greece, this museum is a must-see. In addition to offering a wealth of well explicated artifacts, it\u2019s also very comfortable and easy to navigate. It houses many of the original artifacts from the Knossos Palace, so it\u2019s advisable to",
          "The museum helped place into context what we had just seen in Knossos. Everything was well labeled in English as well as Greek. The exhibits were in a very logical order that allowed us to follow the timeline of what happened in Crete over many centuries. Well worth spending the",
          "This made a good precursor to Knossos. Good to do after lunch as it's air conditioned and indoors! Also the queue here is much shorter than it so buy the combined ticket here to skip the queue at Knossos. With kids, don't expect to spend any more than an hour though. It's a",
          "Spent a few hours in here out of scorching \ud83e\udd75 heat outside well laid out very informative and plenty of exhibits well worth another visit next year",

          "Interior is modern and each room had wonderful didactic panels in English and in Greek. Beautiful exhibition of 2 and 3rd century sculpture. Fascinating to see the objects from the palatial and post palatial eras. Nice model of Palace of Knossos miniature in wood. Not super",
          "This is some big stuff. It\u2019s old as anything and there\u2019s a whole load of it. Minoans, man. Minotaur bull heads, double headed axes. Some of the best collection of old things you could ever want to see really. If you don\u2019t like looking at old things, then maybe you can just go",
          "Crete is said to be the birthplace of Europe. After seeing the incredible finds from Knossos I can understand why. A beautiful museum with breathtaking displays.",
          "Best to combine with a visit to Knossos as this gives you all the context that simply visiting the site may not give you. Great collection which clearly lays out life in Minoan Crete. However, you may be \u2018potted out\u2019 by the end.",
          "Everything that was excavated in Knossos is displayed in this museum. The layout of this museum is perfect as you go from room to room. Good for history and museum lovers.",
          "The sculpture room on the lower floor is wonderful and full of history and interesting information. For those who enjoy old pottery and tools/jewelry, the other lower rooms are nice as well. The upstairs had the original frescos, which are mostly small pieces and re-drawn to",

But sadly the reviewer was spot on - room after room of pottery and pots. And quite a lot of",

          "Bought the package at Knossos (1\u20ac extra for the museum) and it was great. Good complementary museum to the palace itself since it houses some of the pieces removed from there. Careful about parking around the museum, the wardens are very motivated.",
          "Awesome place with very nice exhibits. Must do. Takes a while if you want to see it all. 3.5 - 4 hours.",
          "This is worth making time to visit to help appreciate the complex and rich history of this island. Our guide was excellent and signage is also good and in english.",
          "So many interesting artefacts from the neolithic especially from the Knossos site and other minoan sites. Simply unique and very well structured. One should start from neolithic and the Roman period",
          "If you are in Heraklion, you must visit this museum. Tickets are not expensive, and there is a lot to see. Finishing not to spoil anything.",
          "Great way to learn about not just the origins of Crete, but of humankind! Amazing number of artifacts from thousands of years ago, all in incredible condition. A great introduction to Crete and a prelude to a visit to Knossos.",
          "Well-organized and amazing place where you can observe the roots and development of stunning Minoan civilization. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "The museum is in the center of Heraklion across the street from the Astoria Hotel. We spent several hours there looking at the ancient sculptures, pottery, coffins and jewelry. We thought it was more interesting than the Acropolis Museum in Athens.",
          "The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is an excellent collection of antiquities. Interestingly set up by themes with great explanations of the works and culture. You can get a combo ticket with Knossos. Parking is available in the nearby area.",
          "This museum was a real highlight of our holiday in Crete. There's so much on show and plenty space and light to enjoy it. Amazing to see the real Phaistos Disk and artifacts from Knossos right infront of us! If you are in Heraklion don't miss it.",
          "Fun to see the history. A lot of people though and the line in was long. Nice and cold inside. A lot of things to see",
          "In the heart of Heraklion, across from Astoria square, is a small museum that has treasures from a civilization older than that of Ancient Greece. Here you will find artifacts as old as 7000 years from the early Minoan period, and before. This is a museum which has the great",
          "The museum is a very good walk into the history B.C. it is very well set, splitting into 3 sections of Art, Artefact and sculptures. A very cheap entry tickets. A combination ticket for the museum and Knossos Palace for \u20ac16, youngsters under 16 go free and the retired people",
          "If you consider to visit the ruins of Knossos palace you should visit the museum too. It takes 2 hours to see it all exploring and the development of the Minoan culture in Crete. Some examples of their achievements you find there are really astonishing if you consider that it",
          "A very interesting museum, with a very beutiful exhibition. I missed more information in english. Take the tour in conection with a tour on Knosos.",
          "Money spent well, with a guide. Gave us plenty information about the ancient history and Knossos. Lovely staff who is always helpful when traveling with kids.",
          "This museum has an abundance of treasure to see. Loads of well preserved goodies to admirer. The kids (4 and 8) really enjoyed it but the museum staff didn\u2019t really like their enthusiasm. We were told to be quiet a couple of times, which was annoying as everyone else was",
          "Would highly recommend visiting Heraklion Archaeological Museum before visiting Knossos. You will see not only many artifacts from Knossos but also a miniature reconstruction that will give you an idea of exactly how Knossos looked originally. Either take a good, detailed",
          "I loved this museum and would suggest that you go there before you visit Knossos and would suggest that if its an either or decision, go for the museum. So much to see and what really came home to me was the creativity of the Minoans.",
          "Visited here and went just after opening time before the tours start for a calm visit round the museum. It\u2019s on 2 levels, with a lift if required, and fascinating looking at all the exhibits, some of which date back to about 4,000 years ago. It takes you through different",
          "Most of the exhibits are Minoan. I got a much clearer picture of how advanced and impressive the Minoans were from the museum visit than I did from the Knossos site itself. The highlights were a bull with intact golden horns and a statuette of the snake goddess that was revered",
          "This museum holds many amazing finds of the Minoan culture that was in many aspects the start of all of western civilisation. Of course there are also more recent artifacts. It's very straightforward to navigate. Some parts of the museum were closed off due to reconstruction,",
          "Went into the museum perhaps at the wrong time as a couple of coaches had just arrived, exhibits are well presented but half the museum was closed off.",
          "Beautiful collection of Minoan (and graeco-roman) archaeological treasures. Go and see for yourself!",
          "I am a moderate fan of museums but this was tremendous, I spend 1 hour in a rush but it would be good to stay 2h, they have splendid collection of masterpieces from Crete, they are beautiful now and hard to imagine that they were created 4000 years ago, definetely worth going",
          "This museum is a must if you visit Crete, is a great complement to your visit Knossos!. I gave a really bad review to our visit based on our experience with the personnel working at the museum, my family and I had the opportunity to visit multiple museums around the globe and",
          "Unless you are an archaeologist, Minoan site visits can be frustrating and disappointing. A prior visit to this excellent museum will give you a few clues about what you will find at the sites.",
          "A wonderful large museum which we visited after spending the morning at Knossos Archeological Site. This museum is full of amazing exhibits from the site and you need a minimum of two hours to absorb all the history on show.",
          "Great location with so many excellent treasures from Knossos palace and other places. It is near the pedestrian street with great shopping and restaurants.",
          "Incredible artefacts on display well laid out and very informative. Brings the whole Minoan civilisation to life. Really enjoyed our visit.",
          "The Museum exhibits some of the most significant and unique objects, and artefacts, sculptures and murals from the glorious Minoan era and Ancient times. Moreover the Museum frequently organizes various interesting events, increasing interaction with local community. The Museum",
          "Get the joint ticket for the museum and Knossos, but go to the museum first. So much was dug up out of Crete rulers\u2019 tombs from 5000 BC, and it\u2019s on display here, in very good condition with easy to read descriptions. The sophistication of Crete\u2019s culture at the time of Egypt",
          "This museum is so interesting. There are so many things to see and learn. The exhibitions and rooms are spectacular, the building itself is beautiful, and there is an area outside where you can eat or just sit and relax with a view of the city. Love this place.",
          "Europe\u2019s ancient history presented simply and beautifully. You do not need a guide to enjoy this lovely place. The gift shop is minimal",
          "I had purchased a combined ticket for the Knossos archaeological site and the museum. I was not aware about what exactly was exhibited in this museum and hence very pleasantly surprised. There are around 25 rooms, chronologically arranged, in which there are exhibits of the",
          "We visited Crete for the first time this year and had high hopes of this museum; it had been hyped to the skies. As I'd recently finished a museum skills course, I was also very interested to see how things were done in a country other than my own. And there were some beautiful",
          "Wonderful collection of Greek artifacts and plenty of information available, this museum is perfect for anyone who is interested in Greek history. However be advised, in conjunction with much of Crete, toilet paper is to thrown in a bin rather than down a toilet. This is fine,",
          "Do not miss visiting this museum. Wonderful artifacts and frescoes found at the Knossos Palace site. We had a private guide while touring the museum which enhanced our visit. A must see.",
          "Great display of Minoan artefacts, Roman/Greek statues & Frescoes. Part of the Greek/ Roman section was closed off. Spent over 2 hours there. You can buy a combined ticket, which allows you into Knossos Palace too. Warning though to those over 65, you must have 'proof of age' to",
          "I liked it a lot i went there my second day it was very interesting place to visit , its exactly in the center of Heraklion",
          "I advise you to combine a visit to this museum with a visit to the Palace at Knossos. You can buy a combination ticked if you wish to do so. This museum has a impressive display of Minoan art and/or other Minoan objects. I was especially impressed by the famous bull head and the",
          "The best museum to see Minoan civilization in Greece located in Heraklion Town centre. The complete collection of Cretan artefacts from Minoan era. A must visit & important attraction in Crete !",
          "Lots of archeological things, really versatile collection, a travel through time. I suggest to visit the museum first, then Knossos palace, so you can imagine better how the palace looked like. Here it's well explained and illustrated. I only rated 4 not 5 because less would be",
          "We ended up here before we went to Knossos but it honestly didn't matter. The age of the artifacts here is astounding and really makes you reconsider how you think about history.",
          "Had a fantastic tour of the Knossos Palace with We Guide, Joanna, and then got to see the many artifacts she mentioned on the tour.",
          "Very interesting walk around the museum you can easily do this yourself without a guide if you\u2019re prepared to take public transport from the suburbs. Amazing a lot of these items have survived such a long time! Only sight drawback it was heavy on the items such as pots and",
          "We spent two and a half hours at this museum. One of the best of its kind. Beautifully displayed with artifacts from different ancient sites.",
          "It's nice it's weird to get too and drive its easier... Toilets are on site, clean and well maintained",
          "Make sure you go here after visiting the Palace of Knossos, it all makes sense and shows off a fantastic collection of wonderful findings, there is a joint ticket available currently 16 Euros for both attractions, which represents a saving of 4 Euros as otherwise its 10 Euros",
          "This is a beautifully curated collection. Even with crowds it is enjoyable to visit. Getting in is efficient, but once in facilities such as bathrooms need an upgrade. At the time of our visit there was no cafe! Unbelievable for a museum of this importance. What a missed",
          "This museum is excellent. It has an excellent selection of artifacts from the region and is well curated. I often get impatient in museums, but I wish I could have spent more time here. It was impressive! I purchased the ticket that also got me into the palace at Knossos, which",
          "Went to this museum following a tour of Knossos on 5 June.. The museum is on 2 floors but after touring the ground floor exhibits when we went upstairs the only part open was the fresco display the rest of the floor was closed. This meant nearly half the museum was closed. When",
          "A detailed and interesting collection of historic Greek artefacts. Lots of information. Some amazing pieces that demonstrate the incredible craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks. A large amount of artefacts from Knossos are here and we preferred the museum to visiting the site",
          "This is a modern museum with a treasure trove of artefacts. Well presented, easy to move around and very well lit.",
          "My wife and I were truly in awe of what is on show at this amazing museum. Every item is unique and not one is duplicated. From beautiful Minoan relics 3000BC which make you wonder how they could produce such items given this was the Bronze Age! The layout is excellent and moves",
          "Not Le Louvre or the British national museum or any other great famous museum but a very large illustration and explanation of the mineo\u00e0n civilization !Amazing !",
          "Personally I would say this was the best museum I have ever been to. Truly I am amazed.The ancient Minoan artefacts are as stunning as anything you'd see in a museum of 20th century art. Even if you're not particularly interested in history or archaeology, I'd suggest",
          "We spent an entire day at the museum taking a deep dive into the amazing array of wonderful archaeological findings. The only complaint was the cafeteria was not open so we had to leave the museum to go to lunch. When we returned they told us there was no re-entry even though we",
          "Although not massive it has some amazing things, fantastic insight into the history of Crete. Some of the articles are beautiful and the craftsmanship from the period beggars belief. Worth a visit . Entrance is \u20ac10 for an adult the staff were very friendly and helpful too.",
          "This museum is considered one of the best archeological museums one must not miss the opportunity to visit whenbin Heraklion Crete.It focuses on mimoan civilazation and displays magnificent articrafts of that period.The mozaics are spectacular they are so vivid and fascinating",
          "It took us about 3 hours to get through the museum, and it wowed us all the way through, from the earliest civilizations through the entire history of ancient Greece. Every time I thought I had seen the coolest piece ever, there was another piece on display that was even",
          "For anyone interested in our past history the Minoan culture is mind blowing. The exhibition is first class and for a non historian very humbling. If you are Heraklion then don\u2019t miss this. I saw with a tour group but hung around until everyone left, I could then the the",
          "An excellent museum! So many things to see. The Greek civilization exposed in a perfect way. Don\u2019t leave without visiting the upper floor with the frescos.",
          "A very nice museum who somebody can see details for Minoan civilization through different eras, from 3500 BC to 1100 BC. It's located in city centre, at old town. Average time of visit lasts from two to three hours and price ticket is 10 euros for adults. Definitely a good value",
          "We actually visited this collection twice during our stay as we are particularly interested in ceramics and the collection is stunning. However I couldn\u2019t bring myself to give five stars as I\u2019m in agreement with the people who have mentioned the staff, who in my opinion were",
          "I have been to alot of museums in alot of different countries and this was a whole new experience. The artifacts and material are very interesting however we did not spend as long as I would have liked as I felt all the staff were staring. Anytime you go near anything to look at",
          "The Museum is well laid out and has a blizzard of interesting artifacts. Incredibly they are mostly BC and if you go here first, then Knossos as a secondary visit might be mads a more interesting to your imagination. Surely, you have to add this Museum to your list if you have",
          "I think that the museum itself is very nice, but the organisation of tour guides are entirely below the standards. I was so unlucky that I meet inside the museum four guides. Two of them were ok - Polish and English - they were using microphones and headphones - usual standard",
          "The museum is stunning and full of amazing Artefacts. It's incredible to think that most of the items on display are thousands of years old. It takes you back in time and allows you to marvel at how such intricate items were made with basic tooling and materials. One thing that",
          "Toured the museum with a guide, which was excellent. However, we had to zip around a great deal of the rooms, which took about an hour. Not enough time, but if you leave, your ticket does not allow you to re enter! So many wonderful items!",
          "After visiting the palaces at Knossos, Malia and others, come here to this beautiful new museum and see the fabulous art and artifacts from the Minoan archaological sites. The upstairs also has some Greek and Roman works but they were closed as was the small cafe when we were",
          "So interesting! You need time to see all these fantastic things! So you need to arrange to have enough time to spend.",
          "We visited here on a guided tour after we had been to the Knossos Temple earlier in the day. It has some amazing artefacts from the Minoan and early roman civilisations. Our tour guide said it had only just reopened after three years of renovation. It is good to combine both",
          "An almost unbelievable collection of artefacts from pre-Minoan to Romano-Greek sites on the island. The Minoan era collection is mostly of grave goods and, because these personal possessions and offerings were carefully buried, they are in outstanding condition. The decoration",
          "An extremely interesting visit to this museum. Part of the museum was closed along with the restaurant. Very well laid out interior with well presented artefacts dating back to 7000 BC right up to 0 AD.",
          "We had been looking forward to visiting the museum (and then visiting Knossos) for years, and the place is beautifully laid out and perfectly lit. So much to see! But...about a third of the museum was closed off (one guard said that they didn\u2019t have the staff to keep it open)",
          "A very well laid out myseum with fabulous, mind-bogglingly beautiful artefacts from all the sites in Crete. Should not be missed. Strategically placed benches. Lifts to the upper floor. Do not miss the film at the end explaining the history of the museum itself.",
          "Well organised and presented. Very pleasant and specious venue with a superb Collection. Helpful staff that were keen to answer questions.",
          "This is a well laid out the museum that depicts the ancient history of Knossos. I would probably recommend visiting this museum for about an hour before visiting Knossos itself. It provides a good background that allows one to better associate the ruined at Knossos.",
          "A stunning collection of artefacts which were displayed well with very indepth explanations along the way. The best part however is the layout, which you follow room by room until you reach the exit. Spent 2 hours there and loved it. Only improvement would be either A/C or",
          "Chose to go here as it was too hot to walk around Knossos, after speaking with people I think we got more information here than at Knossos ruins. The artefacts themselves, quality of displays etc. were very good. I would have liked shorter information labels on individual",
          "The quality of some of the pieces is amazing given the period they come from. We had an excellent guide who gave us much contextual history. Really great space, good displays.",
          "The museum displays artifacts from the Island's history dating back thousands of years. from the stone age onwards. It has an excellent collection of artifacts from the Minoan civilization which flourished on the island and is considered the best in the World for Minoan Art.",
          "This is a must see if one is at all interested in the origins of Western Civilization. Extensive collection of artifacts from Minoan and earlier civilizations. Many of the artifacts are from the nearby Knossos Palace archeological site, but also include artifacts from other",
          "Interesting, but more information about every object would be necessary, or a guided Tour. A little bit boring for children as there are no interactive activities.",
          "Best visited after a trip to the Kinossos Palace ruins, and easily accessible by the same #2 bus on your return journey. Remember to buy a joint entry ticket at Kinossos Nicely laid out and explained. Wealth of artefacts from 2000BC onwards. Amazing condition and artistry/",
          "This museum is amazing, nothing like the usual dusty array of boring artefacts. Some of the exhibits are incredible, hard to believe they date from 1600-3000 bc. The jewellery on display is fantastic.",
          "So many artefacts on show, I spent hours here. An absolute steal for the price of entry. I bought the ticket to this combined with access to the Palace of Knossos. Mindblowing displays, with everything very well explained in concise English.",
          "2 floors. Simple layout. Glad we had a tour guide with us to lead us through or I might not have appreciated it as much. Beautiful murals and pottery.",
          "I spent hours and hours in this wonderful museum. What a tremendous collection of artifacts from the ancient Greek civilization! This is a MUST SEE when in Crete.",
          "The museum houses many artefacts displayed in a chronological manner. The staff advise as to the best route and although notices say no photography is allowed no one prevented photographs being taken although no flash was used. The fresco displays on the second floor are",
          "The museum is a very good place to get a great overview from the Minoan time and history. Take your time, for sure you will need 2 hours or more.",
          "double up and see the place of knossos for 16 euros a great way to spend an afternoon . went on a Sunday and the cafe was closed which was dissapopinting. but the exhibits are excellent and lots of places to sit , when you get to our age and having spent 3 hours walking around",
          "Well worth a visit , very interesting to learn about the past of such a fascinating place we all enjoyed it",
          "The ticket is sold along with Knossos palace by paying just 1 euro extra. It is recommended to visit the place after seeing the palace. The museum is on 2 floors. The ground has all artifacts recovered from Knossos. The bee pendant is the highlight. Scripts, statues, vessels,",
          "We enjoyed the Archaeological Museum very much, it is even free for students in the EU! There was a lot of information on all the artefacts which were well maintained. There was a lot of history that I recognised from visiting Knossos Palace and there is certainly a lot to learn",
          "see Crete from years gone by.you need a good few hours to see all the amazing artifacts on show here,great day out",
          "If you intended to visite Knossos then YOU-must visit the museum first or you won\u2019t understand all the guide will tell you, it is important to take your time and read all the information provided, the museum would clearly benefit from some audio guide or a tablet application to",
          "We were informed that the museum does not provide guided tours. This however was no drawback because of the description on the object lables was also in English.",
          "We visit here prior to going to Knossos & what a good idea that was. The exhibits are well laid out & the information is good. If you are over 65 & take photo I.d. you can get a combined ticket for this, & Knossos, at half price.",
          "Very attractive in layout and presentation of a huge array of artifacts from Neolithic times forward to Roman era. Great insights into skills and wealth of the Minoan and Cretan cultures and Empires. Especially the development of pottery, jewelry and working with rocks.",
          "Great museum with lots of English explanations, tons of material and very much a professional museum! Well worth the money, and we learned a lot!",
          "It was interesting, yet the information could be more elaborate. We missed the interaction and would have liked more different items and explanations",
          "We purchased the combination ticket for Knossos and the museum and enjoyed both. There were lots of helpful signs along with displays. Some of the frescoes were more modern completion than original, but still beautiful. Sometimes can get clogged up with big groups, but well",
          "Both the collection of this museum and its presentation are breathtaking. A definite must-see. Go there before you visit Knossos.",
          "Okay, so I know a bit about history and archaeology and a lot of the exhibits had meaning for me but the overall effect of this 'modern' museum was simply a let-down. For the average customer I can see much of the display falling into the boring category. Little attention has",
          "Great to do after the palace of Knossos so very interesting stuff here over 6000 years old not to be missed",
          "Well-presented items from the archaeological sites in Crete and the surrounding islands. Explanations in English. A manageable museum that enhances your understanding of the Minoan and later civilizations. If you visit the ruins, you need to visit the museum.",
          "Interesting Museum with lots of beautiful vessels and gold jewellery even the modern women would be proud to wear. The history behind each display was fascinating. Really enjoyed our visit here.",
          "If you like ancient Greece it is a must see for you. Rich descriptions, well organized displays and hundreds of excellent artifacts showing what was lost. It is really amazing collection. What I missed most was more modern times. Have at least 2 hrs to see all rooms.",
          "Museum is laid out well, without crowding, so we were able to browse around others fairly easily. The combined ticket with knossos makes thia good value. We parked at the port for \u00a32.50 for the day.",
          "Beautiful museum dedicated to the extraordinary finds taken by the 20th century finds of Evans at Knossos. Priceless pieces of mosaic, ceramics and Gold jewelry. Plan at least an hour to work your way through thevexhabits",
          "This museum is a gem. Very different content to the new archeological museum in Athens. We particularly loved the frescoes from around 2000 B.C., many of which were from the Minoan Knossos palace (about 6km away), but there is much, much more. Artefacts are beautifully",
          "Since the construction of a brand new archaeological museum in Heraklion (I think it opened it 2012) the stunning finds from all over Crete are now properly displayed for the very first time. A joint ticket (valid for three days) is available for both entrance to the",
          "It was worth the visit. The communities in that era was very advanced. It came as a surprise. I was very impressed with some of the pottery design and functionality. I can see where a lot of gold jewellery design cane from ( even the ones from a India and China). There was a",
          "Once you have visited Knossos, the palace at Phaistos or the palace at Malia head back to this museum and spend a wonderful afternoon absorbed in history. At Knossos you can buy a joint ticket so entry to the museum will only be 1 euro rather than 5 euros - not sure whether",
          "This is a very good museum with exhibits from many different periods showing extensive history of Crete",
          "For an intro to Minoan culture, visitors should plan for a few hours at least at this modern museum. Lots of fascinating artifacts with descriptions in Greek and in English.",
          "went there with a package tour and tour guide. it was very interesting and leant a lot about history of Crete and minoan kingdom. definitely worth a visit if you are interest in the culture and history of Crete.",
          "This museum provides a very important complement to a visit to the ruins of the Temple of Knossos. As much as the Knossos site is very poorly presented, this museum makes up for it with beautifully presented and described artefacts dating back to the beginnings of the Minoan",
          "The exhibits are superb and the museum itself is a joy. Everything is displayed beautifully. What a great collection they have. The treasures of Knossos are in the museum.",
          "Nicely organized and a great pair to see before knossos. Lots of great minoan artifacts showing the evolution of their culture.",
          "The museum we well designed and there were good informatics. The title sounds a bit glib but we were genuinely blown away by the exhibits especially those from over 5000 years ago. Some of the jewellery and ceramics could match those produced today. The cafe was closed so go for",
          "Absolutely amazing exhibits from the minion civilization..... cap this off with a trip to the larger archeological museum in Athens !",
          "23 years since my last visit to the museum and (being older and possibly wiser) my decision to re-visit was a good one. The museum is amazing and the number of exhibits, both large and small, overwhelming and breathtaking, allowing you to appreciate the unbelievable artistry and",
          "Great place for history, but go here as well as Knossos Palace so you can see where they got a lot of the exhibits from.",
          "I visited after I saw the attraction (Knossos, downtown, port) and I learned so much more about the history. I highly recommend a visit.",
          "Amazed about the history of crete !!! Very friendly staff i definetely recomend it . Its a must going there .",
          "If you are interested in history, and planning on visiting any ruins on Crete, you must stop first at this fantastic museum. The displays are informative, and very well laid out. Phenomenal objects on display! It could definitely be improved for children and those interested in",
          "Don't miss this-worth the trip to Crete. Do not let your tour group short-change the time you need to visit this museum.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It's well thought out, and the content is really interesting. The miniature reconstructions of Knossos was helpful and beautiful. Good collections and good organization.",
          "So much rich ancient history for the region I had no idea! Great educational experience for the whole family. Also great companion to the Knossos site.",
          "We ran round and had a great time here. Really fascinating exhibits with some great pieces from the palace at Knossos - best done after the palace so that the pieces add up.",
          "Allow plenty of time to read, gaze, wander and reflect on the magnificent collection of Cretan artefacts, many from Knossos, assembled in this one place, from long ago! One has to marvel at the ingenuity, creativity, sophistication, hard work, training, loveliness and beauty of",
          "A great collection of objects from Minoan sites, sorted chronologically and supported by informative boards and interactive screens. Most exhibited items are ceramics but the styles and uses are so varied that it would be hard to get bored. You can also learn about the Minoan",
          "A nice museum, but have a guide! My second time here, and there is hard to understand stories and stuff just by looking!",
          "The numerous findings from the Palace of Knossos such as art, pottery, vessels, figurines, and the original wall-paintings, are all housed in Archaeological Museum of Heraklion. This museum contains the most important Minoan collection.",
          "Minimum 2 hours to enjoy it. Best sight in town. Indoor, fully air conditioning during summer. I was thrilled by the golden ring of King Minos. Ideal to be combined with shopping. There is combined ticket with Knossos Palace which is 5km south of the town. There is cheap blue",
          "An excellent presentation of artifacts of vases, statues, jewellery that have been dated 2000 and 3000 BC. Makes you realise there was a well ordered civilisation that the Greeks of today feel in their DNA. I felt that this was much more enlightening than Knossos. Of course",
          "Just of off the large central square is the museum which costs 16 per adult for a three day ticket including Knossos The museum is firstly well laid out in date order and colour coded so easy to walk through However what is more interesting is the collection which has many",
          "Truly unique pieces to Crete. Quite a bit of history here so ensure you have at least an hour or two to visit. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum is quite small but very interesting and well presented ! I much more appreciated that place to the Cnossos Palace and I really felt here the importance of the civilization presented there. Definiticely the place to see in Heraklion !",
          "It is definitely essential, not only for the fans of history tourism to pay a visit to this museum, since it its expedition includes the most significant parts of Greek history and especially the Minoan culture 2500 years BC.One disadvantage is that auto guide is not available.",
          "If you want to see the miracles a great ancient civilization can create you must visit the Historical museum of Crete. A unique experience that you will remember for the rest of your life.",
          "Please go there to watch and admire a great ancient civilization, the Minoan one. Wonderful pieces of art magnificently displayed. You will not regret your visit.",
          "The museum was straightforward and easy to understand. It was also winter time during our visit, so the tickets were half-priced. We walked through the museum without a guide, and it was manageable. The rooms are labeled and a suggested route is plotted out, so you just have",
          "This is a wonderful museum showcasing the finds from the Minoan Civilisation in Crete. Dating from early times onwards the main focus is 2000 - 1200 BCE. There are statues, pottery, flints and much more. The colourful wall paintings are stunning. You can spend 1,2, 3 or even 4",
          "We greatly enjoyed this superb museum. Having visited three Minoan sites it was so rewarding to see so many treasured artefacts clearly displayed. There was an excellent introduction to each section and good descriptions in English by the artefacts. The Minoan civilisation was",
          "This is an incredible collection of artefacts and a must see if visiting the area. Not expensive and easy place to find. Close to the centre of town so easy walking distance.",
          "We visited the Heraklion Archeological Museum last September. Place is awsome! Very nice and organised!",
          "Great overview of the major historical artefacts around Crete and giving the back story on the island and its history. While this attraction is by no means cheap, if you enjoy museums you will find this attraction a must see. I would say the quality of the exhibits are on par",
          "Such a great museum. I really appreciated the phaestus disc. So cool and interesting to read about. The museum takes a long time so come prepared. We did it at night and loved it. Not many people and cooler temps. Highly recommended. Our favorite thing besides going to Knossos.",
          "The museum is perfect: modern, full of information, clean, well illuminated. Today it was half price so I even got a great bargain at five euros. I strongly suggest it to anyone, more than Knossos. I stayed inside two hours...",
          "Very well presented, with good explanations. Not too many people and the area of this city is worth being visited as well A few parkings outside",
          "Good Museum, lots to see and well displayed, visited just on a day visits as part of a cruise party. Would've been good to have more time to look at the artefacts in more depth.",
          "Everything you ever wanted to know about the Minoan civilisation. Unbeatable. Later Greek and Roman period, also good. Down side is that it can be a bit hard for kids, as it is not interactive.",
          "If you go to only one museum on Crete, make it this one, and plan to spend at least 3 hours, or better, go 2 days in a row. Great collection, well displayed. Only downside is that they close at 3, as do other museums in Heraklion.",
          "This Museum was wonderful. However, if you buy the \u20183 day combo ticket with Knossos Palace\u2019 you can only visit each place once. When we went to the Museum the entire 1st floor was closed. We were told that we couldn\u2019t come back the next day. Eventually, the ticket seller did",
          "Exceptional and exciting place! The beginnings of European civilization, but also of the visible influences of other civilizations of the Middle East! Each exhibit leaves a deep impression. Artistic expression, craftsmanship, beauty of these objects fascinates you. It was worth",
          "A museum well worth visiting. The range and quality of the artefacts is truly stunning. Recommend giving yourselves plenty of time or even making two visits to take it all in!",
          "After extensive renovation, the museum finally has the facilities needed to house such a wide and important array of exhibits hailing mainly from the Minoan civilization. Only thing I would like to comment is that I didn't find an easily accessible map of the ancient cities",
          "Great exhibits of some of the most famous and significant historical arifacts of ancient civilizations. I am glad I can now say I saw these with my own eyes before I die.",
          "I travel a lot and have been to many museums and honestly it is one of the best perhaps the best. Why? the layout of the museum allow for easy follow of history. The artefacts are fantastic. I was amazed at how the Minoan people were such great artisans. Definitely worth the",
          "Heraklion (or more accurately, Heracleon) has an excellent museum, unlike anything you can find on the planet. It houses the best exchibition of Minoan art. The Minoans, at their peak, generated culture that still feels contemporary, and influenced abstract art (Picasso and the",
          "We had just 2 hours. Not enough time! There is so much to see, so much to wonder at, such beauty & ingenuity, so well displayed. We only had time to dip in here & there, and left feeling quite frustrated at how much we missed, as we know we'll never be back. PS be careful not",
          "One of the oldest, largest and most important museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. The Herakleion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.",
          "This is worth a visit to see the famous frescoes from the palace at Knossos. It is not the best type of museum for kids as not very interactive at all. So if you travel with kids...concentrate on the main things and try to help them engage with the artefacts.",
          "This is fairly new and worth seeing. We were on a cruise and only had a half day in crete so we bought a combo ticket for this s=and knossos palace great value!",
          "Must see it ! Perfect archeological museum and it was good occasion with free entrance on Saturday afternoon",
          "You need to go there. It's a cultural journey that you must be in. It's actually accessible cause it's close to the most know square : the lion square.",
          "An excellent museum, really well curated - taking you through the Minoan, Greek and Roman periods. Definitely recommend visiting here before going to any of the actual archaeological sites around Crete.",
          "Visited this lovely museum before Knosses. Feel it was right way to do it. Bought joint tickets for both venues. Learnt a lot in well laid out museum. Not busy this time of year. Could have stayed longer than the 2 hours we stayed there but, it closes earlier in winter. 4pm.",
          "You can easily spend up to a couple of hours here, very informative and well laid out. Be careful of the times in winter, as it closes at 4pm.",
          "Very informative place, great works of art and archeological foundings. Here You can learn about Cretan (and greek) history, You can almost feel and touch it. Many beautiful subjects from minoan age, i love the FAISTOS, the bull's head and the original pieces of Knossos frescs.",
          "On a short one day visit to Heraklion we visited both the Palace of Knossos and the Archaeological Museum. Doing both complemented each other well. We took a private tour at the Palace but did a self-tour in the museum. The museum was top-notch in its presentation and have",
          "You just cannot go to Crete and fail to visit the Heraklion museum! You will get amazed by the findings, the detailed decorations, the drawings, the coins, and jewelry. I keep wondering what a great civilization that was! No wonder why Minoans had no enemies and their",
          "We had a short visit unfortunately, but the collection, pieces as well as the organisation, but the staff is awfully rude, which quite spoil the visit... I advise to have at least 2hours ahead.",
          "It is a must! We only had a half day, and I could have easily spent an entire day in there and wish I were closer so I could go back. The restaurant was not open, so I can't comment on it, but there are a lot of places to eat in the vicinity.",
          "We went to the museum on the first Sunday of the month (Free admission). Even with the large crowds the staff kept everything flowing smoothly. Pictures are allowed (no flash). They have a lot of items from pre historic (11 century BC and earlier) times and a wonderful display",
          "Well worth a visit shows so much of the history of Crete makes it easier to understand even if you are not a history fan.",
          "Not at all impressive externally but surprisingly good museum inside! What you are left with is the story of the inevitable rise and fall of the Minoan civilization, from the start in the Bronze Age, through Iron Age, it\u2019s peak and decline.. except it lasted over 1,500 years!",
          "2 floors of stuff, the main things of interest are the Minoan-era items prior to the Hellenic era. Very interesting 'Kamares ware' pottery style I've never seen before. Also the fresco styles are unique, somewhat Egyptian-influenced. I didnt know bull-jumping was a sport!",
          "We spent the day at this amazing museum. There are so so many wonderful exhibits to see here you really need time to take everything in. I thought the bathtub exhibit was the most amazing. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful to be able to see all of the things that are in this museum. It",
          "Excellent museum, showing artefacts from Knossos and other Minoan sites. Exhibits set out in a very organized way with plenty of light and space. It certainly enhanced our visit to Knossos.",
          "This is an absolute must-visit location when in Crete. So glad we took time to see it after our visit to Knossos, it gave a much much better perspective of the Minoan civilization. Very impressive collection of artefacts, all real and authentic (not reconstructed as in Knossos),",
          "We were on a short holiday in Crete and decided that we would like to take a day trip to Heraklion and the Palace of Knossos, We found a tour by Sparrow Travel, which suited us as it picked us up and dropped us off near to our hotel. We paid a combined ticket for the",
          "Really enjoyed our visit after seeing Knossos, brought home the importance of the dig with some really interesting art & jewellery. All displays in French, English, German, Greek & Russian. No queuing lots of Information.",
          "First visit to this Museum. We went on an organised tour from Rethymno with Klados. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and my niece listened intently and found the whole experience wonderful.",
          "The exterior of the building can in no way prepare you for the amazing inside of this spacious museum, which in my opinion is easily one of the top 3 Greek museums. It will take some time to explore but it's the ABSOLUTE MUST when you visit Heraklion!",
          "A must when in Heraklion. The exhibits of one of the most ancient civilisations in the world are spectacular. Don't miss the Phestos discus. Great renovation work.",
          "Easy going museum in the center of Heraklion. Well laid out and interesting without being boring. Highly recommend.",
          "This is a mst if you like history. Very well displayd, although they could work a liitle with the lights. Generous photo policy. Good explanations. Not to be missed if you are interested in history.",
          "After visited Knosos that lacks good and scientific explanations, we also visited Archeological museum, which was great and to me it seemed like everything makes much more sense. There are two floors + usually one extra, smaller exhibition. Btw: there are some dates when they",
          "If you like artifacts and history this place is for you. Very interesting to see how the civilization developed on Crete. I didn\u2019t have time to go to the actual site, but felt like this gave me a good feel for the development of the early civilizations and their beliefs. Highly",
          "One of the best archaeological museums although it doesn't have the size of the British Museum or Louvre. Every object shown is absolutely unique and notable for understanding of the importance of Crete civilization at the time of Minoans.",
          "Spent the day touring the palace of Knossos and also this museum. They really go hand in hand as most of the artifacts here come from Knossos. I would actually stop here first if you have a choice and if you can get a good tour guide it is a major plus. Mostly pottery and",
          "I went on a Sunday after going to the Palace of Knossos. I ended up being free entry. The courtyard was beautiful: columns, shaded with trees and lots of places to sit. A great place to sit and chill out before or after a visit to the museum. You do have to go through a little",
          "Excellent museum, showing artefacts from Knossos and other Minoan sites. Allow two hours or more if you want to rest between exhibits. See this before going to Knossos. There is a combined ticket for both, and if you are over 65, hold and bring an EU passport with you, it's",
          "We went all they way from Sissi to see this museum but unfortunately it was closed as the staff were on strike!",

          "We visited with are 6 month old and used a stroller inside. The Museum has lots to look at and the combo ticket with the archeological site does not cost much more. We first went to the museum and then the site but I would do it the other way around on the next visit.",
          "Do not miss this museum if you go to Heraklion!! Everything is well-thought-out and you move through the museum in chronological order, which helps you to build on what you learn and do so progressively. Took 2 hours to go through all the rooms (2 floors); I took lots of pics.",
          "An incredible wealth of artifacts and information about the past. One could spend much more than 2-3 hours here, but I found that 3 hours was the maximum amount of time before I was so exhausted that i couldn't take in any more (and I did not read every sign or look closely at",
          "Everything Minoan you can think of. Spent about three hours here. Well organized and presented artifacts.",
          "I have never seen anything like these artifacts. So much history and so much truth. We rented a car and saw CRETE. It was an unbelievably Amazing trip. If you visit Greece please island hop and make sure to stop by Crete and see this BEAUTIFUL island full of history and",
          "It was totally one of the best museums I have visited. Really organized and all of its exhibits were stunning!",
          "The exhibits are well done and displayed many artifacts. We learned a lot from the descriptions. We appreciated the free stroller to use for our baby and there is a coat check as well. The garden area outside the museum is peaceful. It was nice that the museum stayed open until",
          "A story well told and explained of the life of human of Crete, through its objects of everyday life, art and other artifacts, with details that are worth to know. I also enjoyed very much the discovery of their civilizations, their moments, their religion, and much more.",
          "The museum holds most of the great finds from the early civilisation on Crete. Wonderful. Early jewellery is exquisite and early writing v important as well as huge pots and tiny statues of female deities. Really valuable to go before Knossos and Malia etc. Get an idea of the",
          "Interesting artifacts to view. You can take pictures in some areas of the museum. There are good descriptions in each area to identify what you are looking at. Also, there are museum personnel in each room who can assist with questions. If you are going to visit the Palace or",
          "Don't leave Heraklion without seeing this incredible museum, which opened up a new world of old history for me.",
          "Visited this museum on a recent trip to Heraklion would recommend highly. It is well laid out and extremely informative and needs at least 3/4 hours to get the best out of it. Well worth a visit.",
          "What could I say: incredible museum, a must-do in a trip to Crete to learn the history and events that made this island. But most of all, to understand how small we are thinking to our technology comparing with what they were able to do at that time with nothing. I don't know",
          "A very interesting and modern Museum with lots of exhibits from Cretan history. Good facilities toilets, restaurant etc,",
          "The artifacts on display are very impressive and give an excellent record of (particularly) the Minoan history and culture. The downside for me was the the lack of explanation of the 'bigger picture'. A bit more effort explaining the context in which these artifacts were found",
          "This museums contains a collection of all things Minoan such as jewellery, pottery, seals, art, etc, as well as some original frescos from arechelogical sites. Considering the age of the Minoan culture the displayed objects are really impressive and give an idea how advanced the",

          "I'm not usually a museum person, I'll admit, but my friend convinced me to visit the Archaeological Museum with her and I'm honestly glad I did. If you go to the Palace of Knossos before, for one Euro more, you can also include a ticket to the Museum, so it's worth it to check",
          "His museum is a must see attraction. Even if you are a clueless fool who loves only celebrity culture you should come here just to see how little we have developed in 5000 years. The museum is stuffed full of magnificent artefacts from the Minoan culture, many of which were",
          "The museum focuses on the Minoan and Roman periods of Crete's history. The Minoan component is particularly well-presented, and is an essential complement to a visit to Knosssos or any other of the Minoan sites in the region. The museum is easily accessible. Tickets to visit",
          "My husband and I just went to the Heraklion Archaeological Museum this afternoon, and were completely impressed with both the size and scope of the collection, and its presentation. The museum begins with the Minoan civilization, that began around 7000 B.C. and ended around 1100",
          "We had a great time exploring the elaborate collection of the museum, they have a lot of beautifull pieces that help you visualise the life in the old civilisations. If you plan on visiting the Knossos palace site within 3 days it\u2019s worth buying the combo ticket, saves you a lot",
          "I you are in Crete even for one day, a visit to an Archaeological museum is a must. The building seems to be newly renovated, spacious halls, amazing artifacts on display with English commentaries. Highly recommended!",

          "The ruins of Knossos near Heraklion are impressive, but they have no museum, you only see footings and the ruins of buildings, many restored in the early 20th century. To truly see Cretan culture - from the earliest times through the Minoan civilisation to the time of the Romans",
          "This is a must visit after the Knossos Archaeological Site.....there is so much to see and so many exhibits are in amazing condition considering their age. Make sure you purchase the combo ticket which gives you entry to both.",

          "We visited this museum in October 2018. The collection of rare artifacts is unbelievable. The exhibition is very well organised. Although it was busy with many German groups we could find a chance to approach every showcase we were interested in. One recommendation for tourists",
          "We did things the opposite of the tours. we saw the museum first and then Knossos. We like this better because we feel we can place the items in the museum better when we go the site. This worked out well in this case as their is a scale model in the museum. It is very well laid",
          "Made two trips to the Archaeological Museum - there is a lot to see. It is all very well presented. Can be crowded.",
          "A very well organized display with some world class highlights. The exhibit includes English captions, well lighted. Even the last video/slide exhibit on the history of the Minoan archeological digs and the main players in creating the museum held a lot of interest. It certainly",

          "If you have been to some of the archeological sites on the island, this gives you a great insight of the arts and crafts. Some of the pots and figurines are so beautiful, it is hard to imagine they have survived for such a long time. Enjoyed it very much!",
          "Incredible iconic artifacts of ancient crete. Amazing stuff. Recommend a tour with Ionna Glyptis to get full and correct context; the wall plaques are useful, but not always complete or accurate.",

          "I'm very glad I visited the museum (which was included in my 8 euro OAP ticket for Knossos. Seeing all the Minoan artefacts enhances the whole Knossos experience. The highlight for me was the Minoan draughts game. But all the pottery and jewelry were also remarkable. I didn't",

          "We enjoyed very much the marvellous artifacts. Exhibitions are pretty well organized. It would have been an interesting visit, if there hadn't been so many noisy groups, all led by screaming guides. What a pity for such an important museum.",
          "The museum itself is beutiful! We didn\u2019t have a guide! And I strongly recomend that, otherwise all you do is looking on clayfigures, statues, tools and so on, without any background! We ordered combined tickets for 16 Euros, because we Will visit Knossos later! A single ticket",

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "Cycled here from Heraklion and stopped off at a number of the little beaches. It is not the prettiest of beaches but the water is fantastic. Luckily, there were ample wave action but watch for the undercurrent as this can be quite strong in places. Plenty of small cafes along",
          "Ammoudara Beach is not the most scenic of resting spots. I wouldn't recommend visiting if you prefer places of natural beauty. The large, blue loungers and umbrellas ruin the atmosphere. The sea seemed rather unpredictable, life guards were constantly pulling people out of the",
          "Went for a quick visit just to see water one more time before leaving for our flight. Easy parking and nice beach not crowded. Looked like locals visit and less tourists.",
          "Not over crowded like a lot of other beaches between Heriklion and Rythemno ... this beach is calm and has a local vibe. Even has a river delta that cuts through the beach making it a perfect shallow spot for kids or wind surfers to practice. Warm waters even in sept. Lots of",
          "The beach is nicely kept with lounge chairs and umbrellas available. As we went in early September, the north winds stirred up large waves that washed up to the first row of chairs, left debris on the shoreline and blew sand in your face. The lifeguard flag were always yellow",
          "The beach is nice if you want to spend one day or few hours by the beach before taking your flight at Heraklion airport. We took the bus number 6 at the airport and were at the beach 30 to 40 minutes later (on the other way we took bus number 1). The cost of the ticket is 1.70e",
          "It was very windy when we used this beach so we probably didn\u2019t see it at its best. Even so, we experienced many nicer beaches during our holiday in the Greek islands. It is small pebbles rather than sand and of course the sea was very rough. There are lots of sun loungers",
          "Not the best sand and not the best waters. A thermal plant behind you... there are much better options as beaches.",
          "We took a taxi from the hotel in Heraklion. It was about 20 minutes away. It's a nice beach, not too busy and it was clean, There were beach chairs for rent and some nice sun shades. The chairs belong to the bars that are there so you also get a waiter that comes along to take",
          "Not so exotic but close to the city and not crowded.The sand is good ,the water is very nice and when waves comes isn't so bad it can swing and it was very pleasent.",
          "Long stretch of coarse sandy beach approximately 10 minutes from downtown Heraklion by car travelling along the major seaside road. Usually pretty wavy but nothing too dangerous and you can spend a lot of time just bobbing around out there. Past the break is a shallow rocky",
          "Small beach , easily accessible by public bus from Heraklion city centre. It is a quiet beach , very clean with some good eating shacks. The beach is worth a visit.",

          "I really love Ammoudara Beach! I always try and book flights there with Easyjet, ecah year when I have the time and money to go there, with my family. I think that it has some really good views of the coastline of the Heraklion area, and of the local coastline of Gazi, Ammoudara",
          "We stayed at the HOTEL NEPTUNE, this was an all inclusive hotel, could not fault it, it was a perfect stay. Our flight was 1hr late so arrived at 11pm tired and hungry and what a lovely surprise, they had put on a cold buffet for the four off us. The room was clean and spacious,",
          "I stayed 400m from the beach in the outskirts of Iraklion. I visited every day. Where I was there was lots of peace and quiet, open space and usually sun. It does get quite windy on Ammoudara Beach compared to other beaches I\u2019ve used elsewhere. Away from the tourist centre",
          "Plenty of free sun loungers, and excellent cafes and bars right on the beach and from the centre of Heraklion it is only 1 euro 70 each way on the bus which takes about 25 minutes.",

          "One of the Google search results I read about this beach warned that there are two beaches on the island named Ammoudara. This can be seen even in this TripAdvisor listing... the website address goes to a page that shows a location west of Heraklion but the map link goes to the",

          "We go here because it's convenient and close to our home in Heraklion. It is not the best beach in the area, but the sand is fine, and there are free sunbeds with umbrellas. But you have to buy drinks and they are pricey. The beach is clean, however, the water is not the",

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

          "So much missed potential with this sight - pickup some little, a little signage and you could increase the potential of this 10 fold.",
          "walked past this all week and didnt realise its historical value this needs identifiying as an historical feature and given some protection other than what is there.",
          "As mentioned in some other reviews we had walked past it without realising it had any historical importance , it\u2019s in the centre of a busy thoroughfare and more people walk round it than look at it which is a shame",
          "This small fragment of mosaic is on the beachfront promenade and is easy to see without having to make a special effort. It is outside shops and there are seats early.",
          "If this antiquity was elsewhere it would be covered over and highlighted with information boards, etc. Instead it looks like an unfinished piece of public art and I literally walked past it!",

          "Having heard mention of this Roman artefact in the guide books I was curious as to its location. We had walked around the old towns overlooking the new centre and across most of the beach fronts and promenades and had seen much of the history but no evidence of it. As we were",

          "Cam across the as we walked around the harbour area. Considering it's age it doesn't look too bad. Read reviews from people who said it wasn't been looked after, but for something outsded in the heat for the last 2000 years, all year round it was in a fair condition! better",
          "although not obvious the fountain is so easy to get to, its along the main street fo waterfront cafes as you head out to the end of the port.",
          "I sat by this piece of archaeology whilst waiting for my wife to exit the nearby jewelers. I didn't know what it was until I saw its picture on trip adviser. I know that if this was in the UK, they would probably build some sort of structure around it to protect and would write",
          "Visit the streets around this amazing link with the past, enjoy.the views, meet interesting people who will look after you without trying to take advantage! GREECE at it's best!",
          "Came upon this site by chance. Situated on the seafront in Heronissos among shops and bars. Small raised railing surround it. No information board to say what it is or why it's there !!",
          "The fountain is on the way to the harbour and is easy to walk past without realising what it is. We only knew because it was in our DK Top Ten guide book. There are also remains of the old harbour in the water as you reach the lighthouse.",
          "We found this by chance while walking in Hersonissos; we had no idea what it was other than guessing it was Greek/Roman mosaic... there was no explanatory notice and it was not well maintained... interesting but not worth searching for, just rather sad....",
          "A nice small roman fountaim, in the middle of the pedestrian street in Hersonissos. Worth stopping and taking a picture while wandering this street",
          "No information to read - it's just there - it would be nice to have some information - it's a shame it's no longer in use.",
          "Just on one side of the fountain you can see a part of the picture the mosaic once presented. They should take more care of it...",
          "Do not go specially of for this. It is tiny, surrounded with what looks like bicycle racks and no information at all about it surrounds the steucture. You would have thought that maybe it would be covered in say glass (or similar) to help preserve it and information about it",
          "don't go specially, we just walked past and it was in poor dusty state with no information to let people know its history. Shame",
          "Hersonissos never ceases to amaze me. Friendly smiling residents, beautiful beaches and mountains. Then as you walk down the beach road, a Roman Fountain. Just there, in the middle of the road! Such is the culture of the island, something so rare in other places. Wonderful!",
          "The monument is nice, too bad it was dirty. It has to have these (ugly) railing otherwise people would climb it,",
          "Great Pokestop, not spectacular, fountain did not work when we were staying in hersonissos for 15 days.",
          "We were walking through town and noticed this mosaic surrounded by we thought looked like bike racks. There were no signs to tell us what we were looking at. The mosaic was in such good shape, we thought that it was something modern. Sad that something this old is just sitting",
          "Lovely, and I took a few nice photos, but if I hadn't known what it was, I would have missed it. There's no signage or information. It is just in the middle of the road between bars, near the shoreline. It is a lovely thing to see though",
          "I guess more people would notice it if there was any info table about what it is and written a few words about it.",
          "This is in the middle of the street on its own surrounded by a railing. It's rather nice but only in passing. Thee are many many other places to visit if archaeology is your thing.",
          "The Hubby and I walked passed this on our evening stroll along the ocean walk. It was truly in serious disrepair and in need of renovation. As it is now, it is more of an eye sore than a glorious piece of the past.",
          "This is not worth going out of your way to see but if you are in the area as we were, then you will probably come across it when out for a stroll as we did.",
          "I had read about this structure before visiting Heronissos in a guide book. I stumbled across it while walking through a bar/restaurant area. It has very little to recommend it as it seems rather neglected.",
          "It is dreadful that this beautiful fountain is just being left to disintegrate. It is mosaic and they are just left in the open air for any idiot to desecrate or the elements to ruin.",
          "We were staying very close to this... Passed it a couple of times and thought it was just some dated 80's fountain without water pumping through it. Then discovered it was Roman. It was covered in rubbish and was in a bad condition. 100% not worth going out of your way to",
          "After visiting the remains of the aqueduct from the valley above Chersonismos, we hade some expectations to the fountain. What a disappointment. The four mosaics were in very bad condition. Not worth trying to find it.",
          "It's a small mosaic on the beach road in a darker or less busy stretch. You can easily pass by and not notice it. Hardly an attraction. I guess a little more could be made of it.",
          "We passed by this fountain on our way to the port wall without noticing it. The only reason we did spot it was because someone had fed some local cats next to it and they were lying on it.",
          "surrounded by temporary tattoo joints and bars, you might miss this! This isn't where you go for archaeology....",
          "No one knows anything about it except that it blocks the road. It is not in a very good state. Neglected and unclean, full of rubbish. One assumes that it is a Roman mosaic.",
          "Very strange - we walked on the street next to the sea to the harbor and found this. There was no way how to figure out what it actually is - sort of sitting basically in the middle of the road. Only later we found it was an ancient Roman fountain. If we haven't found it, we",
          "here are no signs to explain what it is you are looking at, when it was built, or what the mosaics are depicting. It could be a quite interesting little detour, but the total lack of information makes it practically pointless.",
          "The mosaic is quite interesting and reasonably well preserved for an outdoor feature. The fountain is next to a jewellery shop that collects money to feed the local cats so there are always cats around that area.",
          "Pretty, however it is not in great condition and is easy to miss considering there is no sign posting at all. Overall nothing amazing.",
          "in the middle of the walk way along beach , no sign post to let you know what it was so had to find out myself , but vey nice",
          "This is a pretty random attraction. If you didn't know what you were looking at, you would not for a second guess this is a Roman archaeological artefact! There is no sign to state what it is , and only a very low 'fence' to keep people from walking on it. Didn't stop a bunch",
          "We had seen this on trip advisor and were keen to see it. We couldn't find it and half gave up, not knowing that we'd walked past it several times! Very underwhelming, very rundown...would not recommend!",
          "I wondered what this was, it's in the middle of the town, not much of an attraction though, it is full of sleeping cats, which is I suppose nice to look at",
          "It needs a second take to realise how fantastic it is. A Roman Fountain part of the normal street scene! How fortunate we are!",
          "This is a beautiful Roman mosaic fountain remnant, surprisingly in good condition considering it is left exposed to the elements and tens of semi-feral cats! Shame that this isn't a little better promoted, better information to describe it and better protected. Most people",
          "i did a few excursions on Crete,Yes they where nice and interesting especially the historical sites ,the only niggle i Have is ,you seamed very often to be Paying a lot of money just for the bus , and guide due to having to pay for admission yourself ,when you arive at the",
          "A nice monumental in the center of chersonissos , not really well taken care off but still a piece of history",
          "If you don't know what to looking for, you would surely miss it. It is a land of history right near a shop, with a little fence around. Looks like a bicycle parking place.",
          "Knew about the fountain. Came across it without looking for it along seafront by the old port. As Hersonissos only relic, it needs some promotion and a sign with information about it. Everybody walked past it and did not even notice it. Makes interesting photos.",
          "but it was surrounded with what looked like bicycle racks in a dark stripclub area and it wasnt lit up or functional.",
          "Needs information to explain what it is and how it was discovered. Such an amazing piece of well preserved history needs to be promoted and documented.",
          "This is the remains of old Roman Fountain on the harbour road where all the restaurants are. There is partial mosaic tiles left on it so you can see some of the original pattern. If you are staying in or near Hersonissos you will probably come across this during your walkabout..",
          "You stumble over this piece of Roman work as you walk the strip on Hersonnisos sea front, Fascinating how something so ancient can be found somewhere like this",
          "Love the cats who lived there. Each visit left a bit money to feed them. Nice to take a street chair in front of it in the evening and just let time go... just to reach a meaning being on holidays with free head:)",
          "You will find the remains of this old Roman Fountain on the beach road where all the restaurants are on the way to the harbour. There is partial mosaic tiles left on it so you can see some of the pattern giving you an idea of how it would have looked. If you are staying in or",
          "It was just near the port of Hersonissos and we sort of found it by accident. I had been looking out for it and it didn't disappoint. It was fenced off but it was quite intricately designed. SUCH a shame that most of the mosaic had gone, I would love to see one side of this",
          "The Roman fountain is in the middle of the pedestrian road along the seafront. It's not very well maintained or signed.",
          "at the bottom of our road ,just wee bit of roaman mosaic that you could easily miss and watch out for the cat and dog donation box which the local jewellry shop lady runs to help out the local cats and do population.",
          "Nothing extraordinary or worth seeing. You might pass it by and didn't notice. We wouldn't even find it if we haven't turn there by mistake.",
          "On our walks along the seafront to the Old Port we passed this amazing antiquity daily & tried to guess what it had been used for .Now thanks to Trip Advisor & it's reviewers we know it's a Roman fountain. It is sad there is no plaque or sign to tell the thousands of tourists",
          "Any person staying in Hersonissos will see this on their travels along the front. The fountain is in reasonable condition, but full of rubbish and dust. There was no information about the fountain anywhere around. Not worth a special visit, but as you're passing you can see",

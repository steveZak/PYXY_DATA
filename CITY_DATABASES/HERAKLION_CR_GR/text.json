        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

      "name": "Minoan Palace of Knossos",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Knossos (also Cnossos, both pronounced ; Greek: \u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, Kn\u014ds\u00f3s [kno\u02c8sos]; Linear B: Ko-no-so) is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city.Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete. The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1,380\u20131,100 BC. The reason why is unknown, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.\nIn the First Palace Period (around 2,000 BC), the urban area reached a size of as many as 18,000 people. In its peak, the palace and surrounding city boasted a population of 100,000 people shortly after 1,700 BC.\n\n\n== Spelling ==\nThe name Knossos was formerly Latinized as Cnossus or Cnossos, and occasionally Knossus, Gnossus, or Gnossos but is now almost always written Knossos.\n\n\n== Neolithic period ==\nThe site of Knossos has had a very long history of human habitation, beginning with the founding of the first Neolithic settlement (c. 7,000 BC). Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses, and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.Arthur Evans, who unearthed the palace of Knossos in modern times, estimated that c. 8,000 BC a Neolithic people arrived at the hill, probably from overseas by boat, and placed the first of a succession of wattle and daub villages (modern radiocarbon dates have raised the estimate to c. 7,000\u20136,500 BC). Large numbers of clay and stone incised spools and whorls attest to local cloth-making. There are fine ground axe and mace heads of colored stone: greenstone, serpentine, diorite and jadeite, as well as obsidian knives and arrowheads along with the cores from which they were flaked. Most significant among the other small items were a large number of animal and human figurines, including nude sitting or standing females with exaggerated breasts and buttocks. Evans attributed them to the worship of the Neolithic mother goddess and figurines in general to religion.\n\nAmong the items found in Knossos is a Minoan depiction of a goddess flanked by two lionesses that shows a goddess who appears in many other images.\nJohn Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic. In the Aceramic Neolithic, 7,000\u20136,000 BC, a hamlet of 25\u201350 persons existed at the location of the Central Court. They lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of exogamy, living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\nIn the Early Neolithic (6,000\u20135,000 BC), a village of 200\u2013600 persons occupied most of the area of the palace and the slopes to the north and west. They lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on socles of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the center of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered 50 m2 (540 sq ft). The walls were at right angles. The door was centered. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.\nThe settlement of the Middle Neolithic (5,000\u20134,000 BC), housed 500\u20131000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the center of the main room, and pilasters and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a 100 m2 (1,100 sq ft) area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second story was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the Late or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4,000\u20133,000 BC), the population increased dramatically.\n\n\n== Minoan period ==\n\nIt is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after c. 2,000 BC, in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including Mallia, Phaestos and Zakro. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at Ugarit on the Syrian coast and Mari on the upper Euphrates.The early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before c. 1,700, almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By c. 1,650, they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces (c. 1,650\u2013c. 1,450) marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.The palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the pithoi that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system. A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.Building techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.The prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade. Herodotus wrote that Minos, the legendary king of Knossos, established a thalassocracy (sea empire). Thucydides accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands. Archaeological evidence supports the tradition because Minoan pottery is widespread, having been found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.This also applies to the mainland, because both tradition and archaeology indicate strong links between Crete and Athens. The main legend here is the Minotaur story wherein Athens was subject to Knossos and paying tribute. The legend concerns a creature living in a labyrinth who was half-man and half-bull. Bulls are frequently featured on pottery and frescoes found at Knossos, where the intricate layout of the palace might suggest a labyrinth. One of the most common cult-symbols, often seen on palace walls, is the double-headed axe called the labrys, which is a Carian word for that type of tool or weapon.At the height of Cretan power around 1,450 BC, the palaces at Mallia, Phaestus, and Zakro were destroyed along with smaller settlements elsewhere. Only Knossos remained and it survived until c. 1,370. At the time of its destruction, it was occupied by Greeks, whose presence is suggested by a new emphasis on weapons and warfare in both art and burial. Mycenaean-style chamber tombs had been adopted and there was mainland influence on pottery styles. Confirmation came in written form after Michael Ventris deciphered the Linear B tablets and showed the language to be an early form of Greek that was quite unlike the earlier Linear A. Sir Arthur Evans found the Linear B tablets at Knossos and, although the writing was different from the Linear A ones at Phaestus and elsewhere, he thought they were a development of the first and so called them Linear B.Despite speculation that Knossos was destroyed by the volcanic eruption on Santorini, it is generally accepted that the cause was human violence following an invasion of Crete by Greeks from the Argolid, most probably Mycenaean. Knossos was still prosperous at the time of its destruction c. 1,370 with trade and art continuing to thrive. Explanations for its destruction are speculative, but a likely reason is that the Mycenaeans, now prospering on the mainland, decided to remove a rival power.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nIn Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had Daedalus construct a labyrinth, a very large maze (by some connected with the double-bladed axe, or labrys) in which to retain his son, the Minotaur. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen Ariadne. The name \"Knossos\" was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.\nAs far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos' discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins \"labyrinthine\". Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father is an ancient Greek king named Aegeus, the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth \u2013 a building like a maze \u2013 by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.\nAs it turns out, there probably was an association of the word labyrinth, whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the Mycenaean world as an apotropaic mark: its presence on an object would prevent it from being \"killed\". Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the Aegean. And finally, it appears in Linear B on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, Daburinthoio potniai, \"to the mistress of the Labyrinth,\" recording the distribution of one jar of honey. A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.\n\n\n== Hellenistic and Roman period ==\nFieldwork in 2015 revealed that during the early Iron Age, Knossos was rich in imports and was nearly three times larger than indicated by earlier excavations. Whilst archaeologists had previously believed that the city had declined in the wake of a socio-political collapse around 1,200 BC, the work found instead, that the city had prospered, with its final abandonment coming later.After the fall of the Minoans, Knossus was repopulated approximately 1,000 BC and it remained one of the most important centers of Crete. The city had two ports: Amnisos and Heraklion. According to the ancient geographer Strabo the Knossians colonized the city of Brundisium in Italy. In 343 BC, Knossos was allied with Philip II of Macedon. The city employed a Phocian mercenary named Phalaikos against their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who sent their king Archidamus III against the Knossians. In Hellenistic times Knossos came under Egyptian influence, but despite considerable military efforts during the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC), the Ptolemies were not able to unify the warring city states. In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the Lyttian War in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the Polyrrhenians and the Macedonian king Philip V.Twenty years later, during the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), the Knossians were once more among Philip's opponents and, through Roman and Rhodian aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence. With Roman aid, Knossus became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose Gortys as the capital of the newly created province Creta et Cyrene. In 36 BC, Knossus became a Roman colony named Colonia Iulia Nobilis. The colony, which was built using Roman-style architecture, was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.\nThe identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation 85 m (279 ft) from current sea level. Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse. The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala. The Romans believed they were the first to colonize Knossos.In Christian times, Knossos became a titular see, but during the ninth century AD the local population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion). By the thirteenth century, it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall'; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves bishops of Knossos until the nineteenth century. Today, the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.\n\n\n== Discovery and modern history of the antiquities ==\n\nThe site of Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos. The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941) and his team, and continued for 35 years. Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B, to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present. From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.\nSince their discovery, the ruins have undergone a history of their own, from excavation by renowned archaeologists, education, and tourism, to occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars. This site history is to be distinguished from the ancient.\n\n\n== Palace complex ==\nThe features of the palace depend on the time period. Currently visible is an accumulation of features over several centuries, the latest most dominant. Thus, the palace was never exactly as depicted today. In addition, it has been reconstituted in modern materials. The custom began in an effort to preserve the site from decay and torrential winter rain. After 1922, the chief proprietor, Arthur Evans, intended to recreate a facsimile based on archaeological evidence. The palace is not exactly as it ever was, perhaps in places, not even close, and yet in general, judging from the work put in and the care taken, as well as parallels with other palaces, it probably is a good general facsimile. Opinions range, however, from most skeptical, viewing the palace as pure fantasy based on 1920s architecture and art deco, to most unquestioning, accepting the final judgements of Arthur Evans as most accurate. The mainstream of opinion falls between.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, the terms \"Knossos\" and \"palace\" are somewhat ambiguous. The palace was never just the residence of a monarch, although it contained rooms that might have been suitable for a royal family. Most of the structures, however, were designed to serve a civic, religious, and economic center. The term palace complex is more accurate. In ancient times, Knossos was a town surrounding and including the Kephala. This hill was never an acropolis in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground. These circumstances cannot necessarily be imputed to other Minoan palaces. Phaistos, contemporaneous with Knossos, was placed on a steep ridge, controlling access to the Messara Plain from the sea, and was walled. To what degree Minoan civilization might be considered warlike remains debatable. It can, however, be said that Knossos bore no resemblance to a Mycenaean citadel, whether before or during Mycenaean Greek occupation.The complex was constructed ultimately around a raised central court on the top of Kephala. The previous structures were razed and the top was made level to make way for the court. The court is oblong, with the long axis, which points north-northeast, generally described as pointing \"north\". Plot plans typically show the court with the long axis horizontal, apparently east-west with the north on the right, or vertical with the north on the top. Either arrangement is confusing unless the compass points are carefully marked. About 5 km (3.1 mi) to the north of the palace complex is the sea at the Port of Heraklion. Directly to the south is Vlychia Stream, an east-west tributary of the north-south Kairatos. Kephala is an isolated hill at the confluence.The Kairatos River reaches the sea between the modern port of Heraklion and Heraklion Airport to the east. In ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate. Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.The archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.The Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.\n\n\n=== General features ===\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, Late Minoan. The palace has an interesting layout  \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The 6 acres (24,000 m2) of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers (pithoi) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n\n=== Water management ===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\nAqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs there are the source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at Mycenae.\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained an example of the first known water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a floor drain or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n\nRunoff system. Sloped channels lead from a catchment basin.\nRunoff system. Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.\n\n\n=== Minoan columns ===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height (entasis), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.\n\n\n=== Pottery ===\n\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n\n=== Frescoes ===\n\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed fresco panel murals, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground hematite. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh stucco with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.The decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: humans, legendary creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.\n\n\n=== Throne room ===\n\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called Throne Room or Little Throne Room, dated to LM II. This chamber has an alabaster seat identified by Evans as a \"throne\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a lustral basin, which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on seal rings, which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n\nThe seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"heraldic arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the Mycenaeans would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\nA room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess, who would have sat in the throne, either in effigy, or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of divinity rather than a heraldic motif.Additional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\nA long-standing debate between archaeologists concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a theocratic manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of Bronze Age Crete, and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the Mycenaeans, although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAenesidemus (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\nChersiphron (sixth century BC) architect\nEpimenides (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\nErgoteles of Himera (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\nMetagenes (6th century BC) architect\nMinos (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagasa\nTrapeza\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwindale, Ian. \"Minoan Crete website: Knossos Pages\".\n\"Knossos\".

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs.

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

It was an important sanctuary since Neolithic times. It was dedicated to Eileithyia, a Greek goddess of fertility and childbirth of Cretan origin. The cave is rectangular, 64m long and 9-12m wide. After the entrance there is an antechamber, which leads to a rectangular room surrounded by cylindrical stalagmites which were probably worshipped by the pilgrims.

It is also known as Ay\u00eda Paraskevi cave, this name coming from the church built on top of it. The cave is 160m deep and 36m wide. The first archaeological researches on the site were done by Arthur Evans, the well-known British archaeologist who unearthed and partially restored Knossos in the early 20th century. A more comprehensive exploration was done by French and Greek archaeologists in the 1960s. They found a number of bronze and ceramic votive offerings, the oldest of them dating from the earliest Minoan periods, suggesting the cave was an important sacred shrine dedicated to a female fertility deity, possibly Britomartis. The cave was still used in Classical Greek and Roman eras, when the fertility goddess Artemis or her Roman equivalent Diana replaced the Minoan deity.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFisher, John and Garvey, Geoff (2007).

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "Rethymno (Greek: \u03a1\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf, [\u02c8re\u03b8imno], also Rethimno, Rethymnon, R\u00e9thymnon, and Rh\u00edthymnos) is a city of little more than 30,000 people (near 40,000 for the municipal unit) in Greece, the capital of Rethymno regional unit on the island of Crete, a former Latin Catholic bishopric as Retimo(\u2013Ario) and former Latin titular see.\nRethymno was originally built during the Minoan civilization (ancient Rhithymna and Arsinoe). The city was prominent enough to mint its own coins and maintain urban growth. One of these coins is today depicted as the crest of the town: two dolphins in a circle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis region as a whole is rich with ancient history, most notably through the Minoan civilisation centred at Knossos east of Rethymno. Rethymno itself began a period of growth when the Venetian conquerors of the island decided to put an intermediate commercial station between Heraklion and Chania, acquiring its own bishop and nobility in the process. Today's old town (palia poli) was almost entirely built by the Republic of Venice. It is one of the best-preserved old towns in Crete.\nFrom circa 1250 the city was the seat of the Latin Diocese of Retimo, which was renamed Retimo\u2013Ario after the absorption in 1551 of the Diocese of Ario and as suppressed only after the Turkish conquest.\nThe town still maintains its old aristocratic appearance, with its buildings dating from the 16th century, arched doorways, stone staircases, Byzantine and Hellenic-Roman remains, the small Venetian harbour and narrow streets. The Venetian Loggia houses the information office of the Ministry of Culture and Sports. A Wine Festival is held there annually at the beginning of July. Another festival, in memory of the destruction of the Arkadi Monastery, is held on 7\u20138 November.\nThe city's Venetian-era citadel, the Fortezza of Rethymno, is one of the best-preserved castles in Crete. Other monuments include the Neratze mosque (the Municipal Odeon arts centre), the Great Gate (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1 or \"Porta Guora\"), the Piazza Rimondi and the Loggia.\nThe town was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1646 during the Cretan War (1645\u201369) and they ruled it for almost three centuries. The town, called Resmo in Turkish, was the centre of a sanjak (administrative part of a province) during Ottoman rule.\nDuring the Battle of Crete (20\u201330 May 1941), the Battle of Rethymno was fought between German paratroopers and the Second Australian Imperial Force and Hellenic Army. Although initially unsuccessful, the Germans won the battle after receiving reinforcements from Maleme in the Northwestern part of the island.\nToday the city's main income is from tourism, many new facilities having been built in the past 20 years.  Agriculture is also notable, especially for olive oil and other Mediterranean products.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality of Rethymno was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nArkadi\nLappa\nNikiforos Fokas\nRethymnoPopulation of Rethymno \n\n\n== Culture ==\nRethymno is home to the following museums:\n\nArchaeological Museum of Rethymno\nHistorical and Folklore Museum of Rethymno\nMunicipal Gallery \"L.

The athletics meeting stopped in 2012 due to Greek financial crisis. Rethymno has many sport clubs with presence in Panhellenic championships of various sports. Below is alist of the main sport clubs of Rethymno.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn the Rethymno Campus of the University of Crete are located the School of Philosophy, the School of Education, the School of Social, Economics and Political Sciences, and the University Library of the University of Crete.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "The fortifications of Heraklion are a series of defensive walls and other fortifications which surround the city of Heraklion (formerly Candia) in Crete, Greece. The first city walls were built in the Middle Ages, but they were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the second longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\nHeraklion's fortifications have made it one of the best fortified cities in the Mediterranean. The walls remain largely intact to this day, and they are considered to be among the best preserved Venetian fortifications in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Byzantine and Arab walls ===\nThe first fortifications in what is now Heraklion were built by the Byzantine Empire. The city was captured by Arabs in 824, and it became the capital of the Emirate of Crete. At this point, they built a wall of unbaked bricks around the city, and surrounded it by a ditch. The new capital became known as Rabdh al-Khandaq (Trench Castle).Meanwhile, the Byzantines tried to recapture Crete from the Arabs because of its strategic importance. After several unsuccessful attempts, Nikephoros II Phokas managed to take the island in 961. The Arab fortifications were razed, and a new fort known as Rokka was constructed instead. Eventually, the settlement grew, and the Byzantines built new walls on the site of the Arab walls.Some remains of the Byzantine walls still exist near Heraklion's harbour.\n\n\n=== Venetian walls ===\n\nIn the early 13th century, Candia (modern Heraklion) and the rest of Crete fell under the control of the Republic of Venice. Initially the Byzantine walls remained in use, and they underwent various modifications. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the expanding Ottoman Empire became a major threat for the Venetians. Due to this threat and the discovery of gunpowder, they decided to build new fortifications around Candia. Construction began in 1462, and the walls took over a century to be built. Their construction was based on designs by prominent military architects Michele Sanmicheli and Giulio Savorgnan (it).\nOver the years, the fortifications were strengthened with the construction of various outworks, while the Rocca al Mare (now known as the Koules Fortress) was built to protect the harbour entrance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and recent history ===\nThe fifth Ottoman\u2013Venetian War broke out when the Ottoman Navy arrived off Crete on 23 June 1645. By August, Canea fell to the Ottomans, while the Fortezza of Rethymno fell in 1646. However, the Venetian garrison in Candia managed to hold out for 21 years, and the Siege of Candia remains the second longest siege in history. The city surrendered in 1669, and the Venetians and most of the population were allowed to leave peacefully, sparing the city from being sacked.After occupying the city, the Ottomans repaired and maintained its fortifications. The bastions were given Turkish names, for example Martinengo Bastion became Giouksek Tabia.The Ottomans also built a small fort known as Little Koules on the landward side close to the Rocca al Mare. This was demolished in 1936 while the city was being modernized.The walls were damaged by German aerial bombardment during the Battle of Crete in World War II, but the damage was repaired. After the war, some of the outworks were demolished to make way for modern buildings, and suggestions were also made to demolish the entire city walls. The demolition was never carried out, and the walls remain largely intact, being among the best preserved Venetian fortifications in Europe.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe Venetian fortifications of Heraklion consist of a roughly triangular enceinte. The land front has seven bastions:\n\nSt. Andrew Bastion\nPantocrator Bastion\nBethlehem Bastion\nMartinengo Bastion\nJesus Bastion\nVitturi Bastion\nSampionara BastionCavaliers were built on some of the bastions, and the walls had four main gates and three military gates. The entire enceinte was surrounded by a deep ditch and various outworks, including several ravelins, three hornworks and a crownwork. The Fort of St. Demetrius, consisting of a small bastion and two demi-bastions, was built on the hill to the east of the city.Another enceinte was built along the city's harbour, facing the sea. The harbour entrance was protected by the Koules Fortress (originally known as Rocca al Mare).\nToday, only the Koules Fortress remains of the seaward enceinte. The land front is intact, but the outworks and the Fort of St. Demetrius have been destroyed. Two of the four main gates remain intact.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "Knossos (also Cnossos, both pronounced ; Greek: \u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, Kn\u014ds\u00f3s [kno\u02c8sos]; Linear B: Ko-no-so) is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city.Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete. The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1,380\u20131,100 BC. The reason why is unknown, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.\nIn the First Palace Period (around 2,000 BC), the urban area reached a size of as many as 18,000 people. In its peak, the palace and surrounding city boasted a population of 100,000 people shortly after 1,700 BC.\n\n\n== Spelling ==\nThe name Knossos was formerly Latinized as Cnossus or Cnossos, and occasionally Knossus, Gnossus, or Gnossos but is now almost always written Knossos.\n\n\n== Neolithic period ==\nThe site of Knossos has had a very long history of human habitation, beginning with the founding of the first Neolithic settlement (c. 7,000 BC). Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses, and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.Arthur Evans, who unearthed the palace of Knossos in modern times, estimated that c. 8,000 BC a Neolithic people arrived at the hill, probably from overseas by boat, and placed the first of a succession of wattle and daub villages (modern radiocarbon dates have raised the estimate to c. 7,000\u20136,500 BC). Large numbers of clay and stone incised spools and whorls attest to local cloth-making. There are fine ground axe and mace heads of colored stone: greenstone, serpentine, diorite and jadeite, as well as obsidian knives and arrowheads along with the cores from which they were flaked. Most significant among the other small items were a large number of animal and human figurines, including nude sitting or standing females with exaggerated breasts and buttocks. Evans attributed them to the worship of the Neolithic mother goddess and figurines in general to religion.\n\nAmong the items found in Knossos is a Minoan depiction of a goddess flanked by two lionesses that shows a goddess who appears in many other images.\nJohn Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic. In the Aceramic Neolithic, 7,000\u20136,000 BC, a hamlet of 25\u201350 persons existed at the location of the Central Court. They lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of exogamy, living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\nIn the Early Neolithic (6,000\u20135,000 BC), a village of 200\u2013600 persons occupied most of the area of the palace and the slopes to the north and west. They lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on socles of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the center of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered 50 m2 (540 sq ft). The walls were at right angles. The door was centered. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.\nThe settlement of the Middle Neolithic (5,000\u20134,000 BC), housed 500\u20131000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the center of the main room, and pilasters and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a 100 m2 (1,100 sq ft) area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second story was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the Late or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4,000\u20133,000 BC), the population increased dramatically.\n\n\n== Minoan period ==\n\nIt is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after c. 2,000 BC, in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including Mallia, Phaestos and Zakro. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at Ugarit on the Syrian coast and Mari on the upper Euphrates.The early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before c. 1,700, almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By c. 1,650, they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces (c. 1,650\u2013c. 1,450) marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.The palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the pithoi that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system. A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.Building techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.The prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade. Herodotus wrote that Minos, the legendary king of Knossos, established a thalassocracy (sea empire). Thucydides accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands. Archaeological evidence supports the tradition because Minoan pottery is widespread, having been found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.This also applies to the mainland, because both tradition and archaeology indicate strong links between Crete and Athens. The main legend here is the Minotaur story wherein Athens was subject to Knossos and paying tribute. The legend concerns a creature living in a labyrinth who was half-man and half-bull. Bulls are frequently featured on pottery and frescoes found at Knossos, where the intricate layout of the palace might suggest a labyrinth. One of the most common cult-symbols, often seen on palace walls, is the double-headed axe called the labrys, which is a Carian word for that type of tool or weapon.At the height of Cretan power around 1,450 BC, the palaces at Mallia, Phaestus, and Zakro were destroyed along with smaller settlements elsewhere. Only Knossos remained and it survived until c. 1,370. At the time of its destruction, it was occupied by Greeks, whose presence is suggested by a new emphasis on weapons and warfare in both art and burial. Mycenaean-style chamber tombs had been adopted and there was mainland influence on pottery styles. Confirmation came in written form after Michael Ventris deciphered the Linear B tablets and showed the language to be an early form of Greek that was quite unlike the earlier Linear A. Sir Arthur Evans found the Linear B tablets at Knossos and, although the writing was different from the Linear A ones at Phaestus and elsewhere, he thought they were a development of the first and so called them Linear B.Despite speculation that Knossos was destroyed by the volcanic eruption on Santorini, it is generally accepted that the cause was human violence following an invasion of Crete by Greeks from the Argolid, most probably Mycenaean. Knossos was still prosperous at the time of its destruction c. 1,370 with trade and art continuing to thrive. Explanations for its destruction are speculative, but a likely reason is that the Mycenaeans, now prospering on the mainland, decided to remove a rival power.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nIn Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had Daedalus construct a labyrinth, a very large maze (by some connected with the double-bladed axe, or labrys) in which to retain his son, the Minotaur. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen Ariadne. The name \"Knossos\" was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.\nAs far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos' discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins \"labyrinthine\". Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father is an ancient Greek king named Aegeus, the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth \u2013 a building like a maze \u2013 by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.\nAs it turns out, there probably was an association of the word labyrinth, whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the Mycenaean world as an apotropaic mark: its presence on an object would prevent it from being \"killed\". Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the Aegean. And finally, it appears in Linear B on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, Daburinthoio potniai, \"to the mistress of the Labyrinth,\" recording the distribution of one jar of honey. A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.\n\n\n== Hellenistic and Roman period ==\nFieldwork in 2015 revealed that during the early Iron Age, Knossos was rich in imports and was nearly three times larger than indicated by earlier excavations. Whilst archaeologists had previously believed that the city had declined in the wake of a socio-political collapse around 1,200 BC, the work found instead, that the city had prospered, with its final abandonment coming later.After the fall of the Minoans, Knossus was repopulated approximately 1,000 BC and it remained one of the most important centers of Crete. The city had two ports: Amnisos and Heraklion. According to the ancient geographer Strabo the Knossians colonized the city of Brundisium in Italy. In 343 BC, Knossos was allied with Philip II of Macedon. The city employed a Phocian mercenary named Phalaikos against their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who sent their king Archidamus III against the Knossians. In Hellenistic times Knossos came under Egyptian influence, but despite considerable military efforts during the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC), the Ptolemies were not able to unify the warring city states. In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the Lyttian War in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the Polyrrhenians and the Macedonian king Philip V.Twenty years later, during the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), the Knossians were once more among Philip's opponents and, through Roman and Rhodian aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence. With Roman aid, Knossus became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose Gortys as the capital of the newly created province Creta et Cyrene. In 36 BC, Knossus became a Roman colony named Colonia Iulia Nobilis. The colony, which was built using Roman-style architecture, was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.\nThe identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation 85 m (279 ft) from current sea level. Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse. The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala. The Romans believed they were the first to colonize Knossos.In Christian times, Knossos became a titular see, but during the ninth century AD the local population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion). By the thirteenth century, it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall'; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves bishops of Knossos until the nineteenth century. Today, the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.\n\n\n== Discovery and modern history of the antiquities ==\n\nThe site of Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos. The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941) and his team, and continued for 35 years. Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B, to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present. From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.\nSince their discovery, the ruins have undergone a history of their own, from excavation by renowned archaeologists, education, and tourism, to occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars. This site history is to be distinguished from the ancient.\n\n\n== Palace complex ==\nThe features of the palace depend on the time period. Currently visible is an accumulation of features over several centuries, the latest most dominant. Thus, the palace was never exactly as depicted today. In addition, it has been reconstituted in modern materials. The custom began in an effort to preserve the site from decay and torrential winter rain. After 1922, the chief proprietor, Arthur Evans, intended to recreate a facsimile based on archaeological evidence. The palace is not exactly as it ever was, perhaps in places, not even close, and yet in general, judging from the work put in and the care taken, as well as parallels with other palaces, it probably is a good general facsimile. Opinions range, however, from most skeptical, viewing the palace as pure fantasy based on 1920s architecture and art deco, to most unquestioning, accepting the final judgements of Arthur Evans as most accurate. The mainstream of opinion falls between.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, the terms \"Knossos\" and \"palace\" are somewhat ambiguous. The palace was never just the residence of a monarch, although it contained rooms that might have been suitable for a royal family. Most of the structures, however, were designed to serve a civic, religious, and economic center. The term palace complex is more accurate. In ancient times, Knossos was a town surrounding and including the Kephala. This hill was never an acropolis in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground. These circumstances cannot necessarily be imputed to other Minoan palaces. Phaistos, contemporaneous with Knossos, was placed on a steep ridge, controlling access to the Messara Plain from the sea, and was walled. To what degree Minoan civilization might be considered warlike remains debatable. It can, however, be said that Knossos bore no resemblance to a Mycenaean citadel, whether before or during Mycenaean Greek occupation.The complex was constructed ultimately around a raised central court on the top of Kephala. The previous structures were razed and the top was made level to make way for the court. The court is oblong, with the long axis, which points north-northeast, generally described as pointing \"north\". Plot plans typically show the court with the long axis horizontal, apparently east-west with the north on the right, or vertical with the north on the top. Either arrangement is confusing unless the compass points are carefully marked. About 5 km (3.1 mi) to the north of the palace complex is the sea at the Port of Heraklion. Directly to the south is Vlychia Stream, an east-west tributary of the north-south Kairatos. Kephala is an isolated hill at the confluence.The Kairatos River reaches the sea between the modern port of Heraklion and Heraklion Airport to the east. In ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate. Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.The archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.The Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.\n\n\n=== General features ===\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, Late Minoan. The palace has an interesting layout  \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The 6 acres (24,000 m2) of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers (pithoi) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n\n=== Water management ===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\nAqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs there are the source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at Mycenae.\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained an example of the first known water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a floor drain or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n\nRunoff system. Sloped channels lead from a catchment basin.\nRunoff system. Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.\n\n\n=== Minoan columns ===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height (entasis), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.\n\n\n=== Pottery ===\n\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n\n=== Frescoes ===\n\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed fresco panel murals, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground hematite. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh stucco with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.The decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: humans, legendary creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.\n\n\n=== Throne room ===\n\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called Throne Room or Little Throne Room, dated to LM II. This chamber has an alabaster seat identified by Evans as a \"throne\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a lustral basin, which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on seal rings, which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n\nThe seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"heraldic arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the Mycenaeans would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\nA room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess, who would have sat in the throne, either in effigy, or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of divinity rather than a heraldic motif.Additional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\nA long-standing debate between archaeologists concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a theocratic manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of Bronze Age Crete, and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the Mycenaeans, although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAenesidemus (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\nChersiphron (sixth century BC) architect\nEpimenides (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\nErgoteles of Himera (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\nMetagenes (6th century BC) architect\nMinos (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagasa\nTrapeza\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwindale, Ian. \"Minoan Crete website: Knossos Pages\".\n\"Knossos\".

        "brit": "Knossos, also spelled Cnossus,  city in ancient Crete, capital of the legendary king Minos, and the principal centre of the Minoan, the earliest of the Aegean civilizations (see Minoan civilization). The site of Knossos stands on a knoll between the confluence of two streams and is located about 5 miles (8 km) inland from Crete\u2019s northern coast. Excavations were begun at Knossos under Sir Arthur Evans in 1900 and revealed a palace and surrounding buildings that were the centre of a sophisticated Bronze Age culture that dominated the Aegean between about 1600 and 1400 bc.KnossosPortion of the reconstructed Minoan palace, Knossos, Crete, Greece.Peterak\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nA Visit to Europe\nIn what country does Real Madrid play?\n\n\n\nThe first human inhabitants of Knossos probably came there from Anatolia in the 7th millennium bc and established an agricultural society based on wheat and livestock raising. At the beginning of the Early Minoan period (3000\u20132000 bc) they began using bronze and making glazed pottery, engraved seals, and gold jewelry. A hieroglyphic script was invented, and trade with the Egyptians was undertaken. The first palace at Knossos was built at the beginning of the Middle Minoan period (2000\u20131580 bc). It consisted of isolated structures built around a rectangular court. Knossos produced fine polychrome pottery on a black glazed ground during this period. About 1720 bc a destructive earthquake leveled most of Knossos. The palace was rebuilt, this time with extensive colonnades and flights of stairs connecting the different buildings on the hilly site. The remains of this palace occupy the excavated site in the present day. The administrative and ceremonial quarters of the palace were on the west side of the central court, and the throne room in this area still contains the gypsum chair in which sat the kings of Knossos. This area of the palace also had long narrow basement rooms that served as storage magazines for wheat, oil, and treasure. Workshops were located on the northeast side of the central court, while residences were situated in the southeastern section. An elaborate system of drains, conduits, and pipes provided water and sanitation for the palace, and the whole urban complex was connected to other Cretan towns and ports by paved roads. The art of Minoan fresco painting reached its zenith at this time, with scenes of dancing, sports, and dolphins done in a naturalistic style. The Minoans also replaced their hieroglyphic script with a linear script known as Linear A.About 1580 bc Minoan culture and influence began to be extended to mainland Greece, where it was further developed and emerged as the culture known as Mycenaean. The Mycenaeans, in turn, achieved control over Knossos sometime in the 15th century bc; the Linear A script was replaced by another script, Linear B, which is identical to that used at Mycenae and is most generally deemed the prototype of Greek. Detailed administrative records in Linear B found at Knossos indicate that at this time the city\u2019s Mycenaean rulers controlled much of central and western Crete.Some time after about 1400 bc, what Evans called the \u201cLast Palace\u201d of Knossos was destroyed by a fire of uncertain origin, and fires destroyed many other Cretan settlements at this time. Knossos was reduced henceforth to the status of a mere town, and the political focus of the Aegean world shifted to Mycenae on the Greek mainland. Knossos continued to be inhabited through the subsequent centuries, though on a much-reduced scale.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\n ",

It is also known as Agia Paraskevi cave from the church dedicated to Saint Paraskevi built on top of it. The cave is 160 meters deep and 36 meters wide. The first archaeological examination on the site were carried out by Arthur Evans, the well-known British archaeologist who unearthed and partially restored Knossos in the early 20th century. A more comprehensive exploration was carried out by French and Greek archaeologists in the 1960s. They found a considerable number of bronze and ceramic votive offerings, the oldest of them dating from the earliest Minoan periods, suggesting the cave was an important sacred shrine dedicated to a female fertility deity, presumably Britomartis. The cave was still used in Classical Greek and Roman eras, when the fertility goddess Artemis or her Roman equivalent Diana replaced the Minoan deity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFisher, John and Garvey, Geoff (2007).

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Knossos (also Cnossos, both pronounced ; Greek: \u039a\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, Kn\u014ds\u00f3s [kno\u02c8sos]; Linear B: Ko-no-so) is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and has been called Europe's oldest city.Settled as early as the Neolithic period, the name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete. The palace of Knossos eventually became the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age, c. 1,380\u20131,100 BC. The reason why is unknown, but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward.\nIn the First Palace Period (around 2,000 BC), the urban area reached a size of as many as 18,000 people. In its peak, the palace and surrounding city boasted a population of 100,000 people shortly after 1,700 BC.\n\n\n== Spelling ==\nThe name Knossos was formerly Latinized as Cnossus or Cnossos, and occasionally Knossus, Gnossus, or Gnossos but is now almost always written Knossos.\n\n\n== Neolithic period ==\nThe site of Knossos has had a very long history of human habitation, beginning with the founding of the first Neolithic settlement (c. 7,000 BC). Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses, and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.Arthur Evans, who unearthed the palace of Knossos in modern times, estimated that c. 8,000 BC a Neolithic people arrived at the hill, probably from overseas by boat, and placed the first of a succession of wattle and daub villages (modern radiocarbon dates have raised the estimate to c. 7,000\u20136,500 BC). Large numbers of clay and stone incised spools and whorls attest to local cloth-making. There are fine ground axe and mace heads of colored stone: greenstone, serpentine, diorite and jadeite, as well as obsidian knives and arrowheads along with the cores from which they were flaked. Most significant among the other small items were a large number of animal and human figurines, including nude sitting or standing females with exaggerated breasts and buttocks. Evans attributed them to the worship of the Neolithic mother goddess and figurines in general to religion.\n\nAmong the items found in Knossos is a Minoan depiction of a goddess flanked by two lionesses that shows a goddess who appears in many other images.\nJohn Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic. In the Aceramic Neolithic, 7,000\u20136,000 BC, a hamlet of 25\u201350 persons existed at the location of the Central Court. They lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of exogamy, living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\nIn the Early Neolithic (6,000\u20135,000 BC), a village of 200\u2013600 persons occupied most of the area of the palace and the slopes to the north and west. They lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on socles of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the center of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered 50 m2 (540 sq ft). The walls were at right angles. The door was centered. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.\nThe settlement of the Middle Neolithic (5,000\u20134,000 BC), housed 500\u20131000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the center of the main room, and pilasters and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a 100 m2 (1,100 sq ft) area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second story was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the Late or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4,000\u20133,000 BC), the population increased dramatically.\n\n\n== Minoan period ==\n\nIt is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after c. 2,000 BC, in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including Mallia, Phaestos and Zakro. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at Ugarit on the Syrian coast and Mari on the upper Euphrates.The early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before c. 1,700, almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By c. 1,650, they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces (c. 1,650\u2013c. 1,450) marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.The palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the pithoi that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system. A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.Building techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.The prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade. Herodotus wrote that Minos, the legendary king of Knossos, established a thalassocracy (sea empire). Thucydides accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands. Archaeological evidence supports the tradition because Minoan pottery is widespread, having been found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.This also applies to the mainland, because both tradition and archaeology indicate strong links between Crete and Athens. The main legend here is the Minotaur story wherein Athens was subject to Knossos and paying tribute. The legend concerns a creature living in a labyrinth who was half-man and half-bull. Bulls are frequently featured on pottery and frescoes found at Knossos, where the intricate layout of the palace might suggest a labyrinth. One of the most common cult-symbols, often seen on palace walls, is the double-headed axe called the labrys, which is a Carian word for that type of tool or weapon.At the height of Cretan power around 1,450 BC, the palaces at Mallia, Phaestus, and Zakro were destroyed along with smaller settlements elsewhere. Only Knossos remained and it survived until c. 1,370. At the time of its destruction, it was occupied by Greeks, whose presence is suggested by a new emphasis on weapons and warfare in both art and burial. Mycenaean-style chamber tombs had been adopted and there was mainland influence on pottery styles. Confirmation came in written form after Michael Ventris deciphered the Linear B tablets and showed the language to be an early form of Greek that was quite unlike the earlier Linear A. Sir Arthur Evans found the Linear B tablets at Knossos and, although the writing was different from the Linear A ones at Phaestus and elsewhere, he thought they were a development of the first and so called them Linear B.Despite speculation that Knossos was destroyed by the volcanic eruption on Santorini, it is generally accepted that the cause was human violence following an invasion of Crete by Greeks from the Argolid, most probably Mycenaean. Knossos was still prosperous at the time of its destruction c. 1,370 with trade and art continuing to thrive. Explanations for its destruction are speculative, but a likely reason is that the Mycenaeans, now prospering on the mainland, decided to remove a rival power.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nIn Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had Daedalus construct a labyrinth, a very large maze (by some connected with the double-bladed axe, or labrys) in which to retain his son, the Minotaur. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen Ariadne. The name \"Knossos\" was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.\nAs far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos' discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins \"labyrinthine\". Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father is an ancient Greek king named Aegeus, the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth \u2013 a building like a maze \u2013 by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.\nAs it turns out, there probably was an association of the word labyrinth, whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the Mycenaean world as an apotropaic mark: its presence on an object would prevent it from being \"killed\". Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the Aegean. And finally, it appears in Linear B on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, Daburinthoio potniai, \"to the mistress of the Labyrinth,\" recording the distribution of one jar of honey. A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.\n\n\n== Hellenistic and Roman period ==\nFieldwork in 2015 revealed that during the early Iron Age, Knossos was rich in imports and was nearly three times larger than indicated by earlier excavations. Whilst archaeologists had previously believed that the city had declined in the wake of a socio-political collapse around 1,200 BC, the work found instead, that the city had prospered, with its final abandonment coming later.After the fall of the Minoans, Knossus was repopulated approximately 1,000 BC and it remained one of the most important centers of Crete. The city had two ports: Amnisos and Heraklion. According to the ancient geographer Strabo the Knossians colonized the city of Brundisium in Italy. In 343 BC, Knossos was allied with Philip II of Macedon. The city employed a Phocian mercenary named Phalaikos against their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who sent their king Archidamus III against the Knossians. In Hellenistic times Knossos came under Egyptian influence, but despite considerable military efforts during the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC), the Ptolemies were not able to unify the warring city states. In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the Lyttian War in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the Polyrrhenians and the Macedonian king Philip V.Twenty years later, during the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), the Knossians were once more among Philip's opponents and, through Roman and Rhodian aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence. With Roman aid, Knossus became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose Gortys as the capital of the newly created province Creta et Cyrene. In 36 BC, Knossus became a Roman colony named Colonia Iulia Nobilis. The colony, which was built using Roman-style architecture, was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.\nThe identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation 85 m (279 ft) from current sea level. Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse. The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala. The Romans believed they were the first to colonize Knossos.In Christian times, Knossos became a titular see, but during the ninth century AD the local population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion). By the thirteenth century, it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall'; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves bishops of Knossos until the nineteenth century. Today, the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.\n\n\n== Discovery and modern history of the antiquities ==\n\nThe site of Knossos was discovered in 1878 by Minos Kalokairinos. The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941) and his team, and continued for 35 years. Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B, to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present. From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.\nSince their discovery, the ruins have undergone a history of their own, from excavation by renowned archaeologists, education, and tourism, to occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars. This site history is to be distinguished from the ancient.\n\n\n== Palace complex ==\nThe features of the palace depend on the time period. Currently visible is an accumulation of features over several centuries, the latest most dominant. Thus, the palace was never exactly as depicted today. In addition, it has been reconstituted in modern materials. The custom began in an effort to preserve the site from decay and torrential winter rain. After 1922, the chief proprietor, Arthur Evans, intended to recreate a facsimile based on archaeological evidence. The palace is not exactly as it ever was, perhaps in places, not even close, and yet in general, judging from the work put in and the care taken, as well as parallels with other palaces, it probably is a good general facsimile. Opinions range, however, from most skeptical, viewing the palace as pure fantasy based on 1920s architecture and art deco, to most unquestioning, accepting the final judgements of Arthur Evans as most accurate. The mainstream of opinion falls between.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, the terms \"Knossos\" and \"palace\" are somewhat ambiguous. The palace was never just the residence of a monarch, although it contained rooms that might have been suitable for a royal family. Most of the structures, however, were designed to serve a civic, religious, and economic center. The term palace complex is more accurate. In ancient times, Knossos was a town surrounding and including the Kephala. This hill was never an acropolis in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground. These circumstances cannot necessarily be imputed to other Minoan palaces. Phaistos, contemporaneous with Knossos, was placed on a steep ridge, controlling access to the Messara Plain from the sea, and was walled. To what degree Minoan civilization might be considered warlike remains debatable. It can, however, be said that Knossos bore no resemblance to a Mycenaean citadel, whether before or during Mycenaean Greek occupation.The complex was constructed ultimately around a raised central court on the top of Kephala. The previous structures were razed and the top was made level to make way for the court. The court is oblong, with the long axis, which points north-northeast, generally described as pointing \"north\". Plot plans typically show the court with the long axis horizontal, apparently east-west with the north on the right, or vertical with the north on the top. Either arrangement is confusing unless the compass points are carefully marked. About 5 km (3.1 mi) to the north of the palace complex is the sea at the Port of Heraklion. Directly to the south is Vlychia Stream, an east-west tributary of the north-south Kairatos. Kephala is an isolated hill at the confluence.The Kairatos River reaches the sea between the modern port of Heraklion and Heraklion Airport to the east. In ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate. Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.The archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.The Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.\n\n\n=== General features ===\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, Late Minoan. The palace has an interesting layout  \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The 6 acres (24,000 m2) of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers (pithoi) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n\n=== Water management ===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\nAqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs there are the source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at Mycenae.\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained an example of the first known water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a floor drain or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n\nRunoff system. Sloped channels lead from a catchment basin.\nRunoff system. Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.\n\n\n=== Minoan columns ===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height (entasis), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.\n\n\n=== Pottery ===\n\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n\n=== Frescoes ===\n\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed fresco panel murals, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground hematite. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh stucco with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.The decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: humans, legendary creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.\n\n\n=== Throne room ===\n\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called Throne Room or Little Throne Room, dated to LM II. This chamber has an alabaster seat identified by Evans as a \"throne\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a lustral basin, which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on seal rings, which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n\nThe seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"heraldic arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the Mycenaeans would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\nA room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess, who would have sat in the throne, either in effigy, or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of divinity rather than a heraldic motif.Additional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\nA long-standing debate between archaeologists concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a theocratic manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of Bronze Age Crete, and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the Mycenaeans, although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAenesidemus (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\nChersiphron (sixth century BC) architect\nEpimenides (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\nErgoteles of Himera (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\nMetagenes (6th century BC) architect\nMinos (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagasa\nTrapeza\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwindale, Ian. \"Minoan Crete website: Knossos Pages\".\n\"Knossos\".

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

        "wiki": "Minoan pottery has been used as a tool for dating the mute Minoan civilization. Its restless sequence of quirky maturing artistic styles reveals something of Minoan patrons' pleasure in novelty while they assist archaeologists in assigning relative dates to the strata of their sites. Pots that contained oils and ointments, exported from 18th century BC Crete, have been found at sites through the Aegean islands and mainland Greece, on Cyprus, along coastal Syria and in Egypt, showing the wide trading contacts of the Minoans.\nThe pottery consists of vessels of various shapes, which as with other types of Ancient Greek pottery may be collectively referred to as \"vases\", and also \"terracottas\", small ceramic figurines, models of buildings and some other types. Some pieces, especially the cups of rhyton shape, overlap the two categories, being both vessels for liquids but essentially sculptural objects.  Several pottery shapes, especially the rhyton cup, were also produced in soft stones such as steatite, but there was almost no overlap with metal vessels.  Pottery sarcophagus chests were also made for cremated ashes, as in an example now in Hanover.\nThe finest achievements came in the Late Minoan period, with the palace pottery called Kamares ware, and the Late Minoan all-over patterned \"Marine Style\" and \"Floral Style\".  These were widely exported around the Aegean civilizations and sometimes beyond, and are the high points of the Minoan pottery tradition.\nThe best and most comprehensive collection is in the Heraklion Archaeological Museum (AMH) on Crete (where most pieces illustrated are held).\n\n\n== Traditional chronology ==\n\nThe traditional chronology for dating Minoan civilization was developed by Sir Arthur Evans in the early years of the 20th century AD. His terminology and the one proposed by Nikolaos Platon are still generally in use and appear in this article.\nFor more details, see the Minoan chronology.\nEvans classified fine pottery by the changes in its forms and styles of decoration. Platon concentrated on the episodic history of the Palace of Knossos. A new method, fabric analysis, involves geologic analysis of coarse and mainly non-decorated sherds as though they were rocks. The resulting classifications are based on composition of the sherds.\n\n\n== Production and techniques ==\nLittle is known about the way the pottery was produced, but it was probably in small artisanal workshops, often clustered in settlements near good sources of clay for potting. For many, potting may well have been a seasonal activity, combined with farming, although the volume and sophistication of later wares suggests full-time specialists, and two classes of workshop, one catering to the palaces.  There is some evidence that women were also potters.  Archaeologists seeking to understand the conditions of production have drawn tentative comparisons with aspects of both modern Cretan rural artisans and the better-documented Egyptian and Mesopotamian Bronze Age industries.  In Linear B the word for potter is \"ke-ra-me-u\".Technically, slips were widely used, with a variety of effects well understood. The potter's wheel appears to have been available from the MM1B,  but other \"handmade\" methods of forming the body remained in use, and were needed for objects with sculptural shapes.  Ceramic glazes were not used, and none of the wares were fired to very high temperatures, remaining earthenware or terracotta.  All of these characteristics remain true of later Greek pottery throughout its great period. The finest wares often have very thin-walled bodies.  The excavation of an abandoned LM kiln at Kommos (the port of Phaistos), complete with its \"wasters\" (malformed pots), is developing understanding of the details of production.  The styles of pottery show considerable regional variation within Crete in many periods.\n\n\n== Early Minoan ==\nThis is only a brief introduction to the topic of Early Minoan pottery, concentrating on some of the better-known styles; it should not be regarded as comprehensive. A variety of forms are known. The period is generally characterized by a large number of local wares with frequent Cycladic parallels or imports, suggesting a population of checkerboard ethnicity deriving from various locations in the eastern Aegean or even wider. The evidence is certainly open to interpretation, and none is decisive.\n\n\n=== FN, EM I ===\nEarly Minoan pottery, to some extent, continued, and possibly evolved from, the local Final Neolithic (FN) without a severe break. Many suggest that Minoan civilization evolved in-situ and was not imported from the East. Its other main feature is its variety from site to site, which is suggestive of localism of Early Minoan social traditions.\nStudies of the relationship between EM I and FN have been conducted mainly in East Crete. There the Final Neolithic has affinities to the Cyclades, while both FN and EM I settlements are contemporaneous, with EM I gradually replacing FN. Of the three possibilities, no immigration, total replacement of natives by immigrants, immigrants settling among natives, Hutchinson takes a compromise view:\n\n\"The Neolithic Period in Crete did not end in a catastrophe; its culture developed into that of the Bronze Age under pressure from infiltration of relatively small bands of immigrants from the south and east, where copper and bronze had long been in use.\"\n\n\n=== Pyrgos Ware ===\n\nEM I types include Pyrgos Ware, also called \"Burnished Ware\". The major form was the \"chalice\", or Arkalochori Chalice, in which a cup combined with a funnel-shaped stand could be set on a hard surface without spilling.  As the Pyrgos site was a rock shelter used as an ossuary, some hypothesize ceremonial usage]. This type of pottery was black, grey or brown, and burnished, with some sort of incised linear pattern. It may have imitated wood.\n\n\n=== Incised Ware ===\nAnother EM I type, Incised Ware, also called Scored Ware, were hand-shaped, round-bottomed, dark-burnished jugs (Example) and bulbous cups and jars (\"pyxes\"). Favored decor was incised line patterns, vertical, horizontal or herring-bone. These pots are from the north and northeast of Crete and appear to be modeled after the Kampos Phase of the Grotta-Pelos early Cycladic I culture. Some have suggested imports or immigrations. See also Hagia Photia.\n\n\n=== Agyios Onouphrios, Lebena ===\n\nThe painted parallel-line decoration of Ayios Onouphrios I Ware was drawn with an iron-red clay slip that would fire red under oxidizing conditions in a clean kiln but under the reducing conditions of a smoky fire turn darker, without much control over color, which could range from red to brown. A dark-on-light painted pattern was then applied. From this beginning, Minoan potters already concentrated on the linear forms of designs, perfecting coherent designs and voids that would ideally suit the shape of the ware. Shapes were jugs, two-handled cups and bowls. The ware came from north and south central Crete, as did Lebena Ware of the same general types but decorated by painting white patterns over a solid red painted background (Example). The latter came from EM I tombs.\n\n\n=== Koumasa and Fine Gray Ware ===\nIn EM IIA, the geometric slip-painted designs of Koumasa Ware seem to have developed from the wares of Aghios Onouphrios. The designs are in red or black on a light background. Forms are cups, bowls, jugs and teapots (Example: \"Goddess of Myrtos\"). Also from EM IIA are the cylindrical and spherical pyxides called Fine Gray Ware or just Gray Ware, featuring a polished surface with incised diagonals, dots, rings and semicircles.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Vasiliki Ware ===\nThe EM IIA and IIB Vasiliki Ware, named for the Minoan site in eastern Crete, has mottled glaze effects, early experiments with controlling color, but the elongated spouts drawn from the body and ending in semicircular spouts show the beginnings of the tradition of Minoan elegance (Examples 1, Examples 2). The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it. The effect was paralleled in cups made of mottled stone.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== EM III Pottery ===\nIn the latest brief transition (EM III), wares in eastern Crete begin to be covered in dark slip with light slip-painted decor of lines and spirals; the first checkered motifs appear; the first petallike loops and leafy bands appear, at Gournia (Walberg 1986). Rosettes appear and spiral links sometimes joined into bands. These motifs are similar to those found on seals. In north central Crete, where Knossos was to emerge, there is little similarity: dark on light linear banding prevails; footed goblets make their appearance (Example).\n\n\n== Middle Minoan ==\n\nOf the palace at Knossos and smaller ones like it at Phaestos, Mallia and elsewhere, Willetts says:\n\"These large palaces were central features of sizable cities... Apparently they were also administrative and religious centres of self-supporting regions of the island.\"The rise of the palace culture, of the \"old palaces\" of Knossos and Phaistos and their new type of urbanized, centralized society with redistribution centers required more storage vessels and ones more specifically suited to a range of functions. In palace workshops, standardization suggests more supervised operations and the rise of elite wares, emphasizing refinements and novelty, so that palace and provincial pottery become differentiated.\nThe forms of the best wares were designed for table and service. In the palace workshops, the introduction from the Levant of the potter's wheel in MMIB enabled perfectly symmetrical bodies to be thrown from swiftly revolving clay. The well-controlled iron-red slip that was added to the color repertory during MMI could be achieved only in insulated closed kilns that were free of oxygen or smoke.\n\n\n=== Pithoi ===\n\nAny population center requires facilities in support of human needs and that is true of the palaces as well. Knossos had extensive sanitation, water supply and drainage systems, which is evidence that it was not a ceremonial labyrinth or large tomb. Liquid and granular necessities were stored in pithoi located in magazines, or storage rooms, and elsewhere. Pithoi make their earliest appearance just before MMI begins and continue into Late Minoan, becoming very rare by LMIII (Examples 1, Examples 2). About 400 pithoi were found at the palace of Knossos. An average pithos held about 1100 pounds of fluid. Perhaps because of the weight, pithoi were not stored on the upper floors.\n\n\n=== New styles ===\nNew styles emerge at this time: an Incised Style, the tactile Barbotine ware, studded with knobs and cones of applied clay in bands, waves and ridges, sometimes reminiscent of sand-dollar tests and barnacle growth (Example), and the earliest stages of Kamares ware. Spirals and whorls are the favorite motifs of Minoan pottery from EM III onwards (Walberg). A new shape is the straight-sided cylindrical cup.\nMMIA wares and local pottery imitating them are found at coastal sites in the eastern Peloponnese, though not more widely in the Aegean until MMIB; their influence on local pottery in the nearby Cyclades has been studied by Angelia G. Papagiannopoulou (1991). Shards of MMIIA pottery have been recovered in Egypt and at Ugarit.\n\n\n=== Kamares Ware ===\n\nKamares Ware was named after finds in the cave sanctuary at Kamares on Mt. Ida in 1890. It is the first of the virtuoso polychrome wares of Minoan civilization, though the first expressions of recognizably proto-Kamares decor predate the introduction of the potter's wheel.\nFiner clay, thrown on the wheel, permitted more precisely fashioned forms, which were covered with a dark-firing slip and exuberantly painted with slips in white, reds and browns in fluent floral designs, of rosettes or conjoined coiling and uncoiling spirals. Designs are repetitive or sometimes free-floating, but always symmetrically composed. Themes from nature begin here with octopuses, shellfish, lilies, crocuses and palm-trees, all highly stylized. The entire surface of the pot is densely covered, but sometimes the space is partitioned by bands. One variety features extravagantly thin bodies and is called Eggshell Ware (Example 1, Example 2).\nFour stages of Kamares ware were identified by Gisela Walberg (1976), with a \"Classic Kamares\" palace style sited in MMII, especially in the palace complex of Phaistos. New shapes were introduced, with whirling and radiating motifs.(Examples 1, Examples 2, Examples 3, Examples 4, Examples 5, Examples 6, Examples 7, Examples 8, Examples 9, Examples 10)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Age of Efflorescence ===\nIn MMIIB, the increasing use of motifs drawn from nature heralded the decline and end of the Kamares style. The Kamares featured whole-field floral designs with all elements linked together (Matz). In MMIII patterned vegetative designs, the Patterned Style, began to appear. This phase was replaced by individual vegetative scenes, which marks the start of the Floral Style. Matz refers to the \"Age of Efflorescence\", which reached an apogee in LM IA. (Some would include Kamares Ware under the Floral Style.)\nThe floral style depicts palms and papyrus, with various kinds of lilies and elaborate leaves. It appears in both pottery and frescoes. One tradition of art criticism calls this the \"natural style\" or \"naturalism\" but another points out that the stylized forms and colors are far from natural. Green, the natural color of vegetation, appears rarely. Depth is represented by position around the main scene. \n\n\n== Late Minoan ==\nLMI marks the highwater of Minoan influence throughout the southern Aegean (Peloponnese, Cyclades, Dodecanese, southwestern Anatolia). Late Minoan pottery was being widely exported; it has turned up in Cyprus, the Cyclades, Egypt and Mycenae.\n\n\n=== Floral style ===\nFluent movemented designs drawn from flower and leaf forms, painted in reds and black on white grounds predominate, in steady development from Middle Minoan. In LMIB there is a typical all-over leafy decoration, for which first workshop painters begin to be identifiable through their characteristic motifs; as with all Minoan art, no name ever appears.\n\n\n=== Marine style ===\nIn LMIB, the Marine Style also emerges; in this style, perhaps inspired by frescoes, the entire surface of a pot was covered with sea creatures, octopus, fish and dolphins, against a background of rocks, seaweed and sponges (Examples 1, Examples 2, Examples 3, Examples 4). The Marine Style is more free flowing with no distinct zones, because it shows sea creatures as floating, as they would in the ocean. The Marine style was the last purely Minoan style; towards the end of LMIB, all the palaces except Knossos were violently destroyed, as were many of the villas and towns. This was because of the eruption of the volcano on the island of Thera during LMIA. The explosion caused a tsunami which hit the northern coast of Crete, and devastated the coastal settlements where the bulk of the palace complexes were located.\n\n\n=== Rhyta ===\n\nDated to LM IA and following also are conical rhyta, or drinking cups, in steatite and also imitated in ceramic. (Example) Some of the rhyta are ornate libation vessels, such as the noted \"Bull's-head Rhyton\" found at Knossos. The Bull's Head Rhyton, however, was a specific type of which many instances have been found. The bull's head is found in ceramic as well. Other noted stone vases of LM IA and II are the \"Harvester Vase\" View 1, View 3, View 4, from Hagia Triada, which depicts a harvest procession, \"the Chieftain Cup\", depicting a coming-of-age rite, the Boxer Rhyton (Hagia Triada), showing boxing scenes, the Sanctuary Rhyton, depicting a peak sanctuary to the \"mistress of animals\" and featuring birds and leaping goats, and others.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Minoan-Mycenaean ==\n\nAround 1450 BCE, the beginning of LM II, the Mycenaean Greeks must have moved into the palace of Knossos. They were well-established by 1400, if the Linear B tablets can be dated to then. The resulting LM II culture is not a break with the Minoan past. Minoan traditions continue under a new administration. However, the vase forms and designs became more and more Mycenaean in character with a large variety of decoration. Style names have multiplied and depend to some degree on the author. The names below are only a few of the most common. Some authors just use the name \"Mycenaean Koine\"; that is, the Late Minoan pottery of Crete was to some degree just a variety of widespread Mycenaean forms. The designs are found also on seals and ceilings, in frescoes and on other artifacts. Often Late Minoan pottery is not easily placed in sub-periods. In addition are imports from the neighboring coasts of the Mediterranean. Ceramic is not the only material used: breccia, calcite, chlorite, schist, dolomite and other colored and patterned stone were carved into pottery forms. Bronze ware appears imitating the ceramic ware.\n\n\n=== Palace style ===\n\nDuring LMII, Mycenean influence became apparent. The vase forms at Knossos are similar to those on the mainland. The Palace Style showcased by them adapts elements of the previous styles but also adds features, such as the practice of confining decor in reserves and bands, emphasizing the base and shoulder of the pot and the movement towards abstraction (Examples 1, Examples 2, Examples 3). This style started in LM II and went on into LM III. The palace style was mostly confined to Knossos. In the late manifestation of the palace style, fluent and spontaneous earlier motifs stiffened and became more geometrical and abstracted. Egyptian motifs such as papyrus and lotus are prominent.\n\n\n=== Plain and Close Styles ===\nThe Plain Style and Close Style developed in LM IIIA, B from the Palace Style. In the Close Style the Marine and Floral Styles themes continue, but the artist manifests the horror vacui or \"dread of emptiness\". The whole field of decoration is filled densely. (Examples). The Stirrup Jar is especially frequent.\n\n\n=== The Middle East Style ===\nIIIC\n\n\n=== Subminoan ===\nFinally, in the Subminoan period, the geometric designs of the Dorians become more apparent. (Example)\n\n\n== Discovery and recognition ==\nMinoan wares were already familiar from finds on the Greek mainland, and export markets like Egypt, before it was realized that they came from Crete. In most 19th-century literature they are described as \"Mycenaean\", and the recognition and analysis of styles and periods had gone some way on this assumption.  Only in the 1890s were the first finds on Crete recognised and published, from a cave at Kamares.  These were found  by a local archaeologist who allowed the young John Myres to publish them; Myres had realized that they were the same ware as finds in Egypt published by Flinders Petrie.  For several decades analysis of Minoan pottery was essentially stylistic and typological, but in recent decades there has been a turn towards technical and socio-economic analysis.\n\n\n== Written records of pots and pans ==\nThe Linear B tablets contain records of vessels made of various materials. The vessel ideograms are not so clear as to make correlation with discovered artifacts easy. Using a drawing of the \"Contents of the Tomb of the Tripod Hearth\" at Zafer Papoura from Evans' Palace of Minos, which depicts LM II bronze vessels, many in the forms of ceramic ones, Ventris and Chadwick were able to make a few new correlations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPoppy goddess, a LM figurine\nThrapsano, then and now, a village known for pottery\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBetancourt, Philip P. 1985.

        "wiki": "Dionysus or Dionysos is the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking and wine, of fertility, orchards and fruit, vegetation, insanity, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, festivity and theatre in ancient Greek religion and myth.He is also known as Bacchus ( or ; Greek: \u0392\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, B\u00e1kkhos), the name adopted by the Romans; the frenzy he induces is bakkheia. Another name used by the Romans is Liber meaning \u201cfree\u201d, due to his association with wine and the Bacchanalia and other rites, and the freedom associated with it. His thyrsus, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. As Eleutherios (\"the liberator\"), his wine, music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.In his religion, identical with or closely related to Orphism, Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of Zeus and Persephone, and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus. Many believed that he had been born twice, having been killed and reborn as the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. In the Eleusinian Mysteries he was identified with Iacchus, the son (or, alternately, husband) of Demeter.\nHis origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. Though most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner, evidence from the Mycenaean period of Greek history show that he is one of Greece's oldest attested gods. His attribute of \"foreignness\" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called \"the god that comes\".Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus surrounding its consumption. Wine, as well as the vines and grapes that produce it, were seen as not only a gift of the god, but a symbolic incarnation of him on earth. However, rather than being a god of drunkenness, as he was often stereotyped in the post-Classical era, the religion of Dionysus centered on the correct consumption of wine, which could ease suffering and bring joy, as well as inspire divine madness distinct from drunkenness. Performance art and drama were also central to his religion, and its festivals were the initial driving force behind the development of theatre. The cult of Dionysus is also a \"cult of the souls\"; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.Dionysus is shown to be an Agriculture and Vegetation deity. His connection to wine, grape-harvest, orchards, and vegetation displays his role as a nature god. As the god of Viticulture and Grapes, he is connected to the growth and harvest of the fruit.[5] In myth, he teaches the art of growing and cultivating the plant.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe dio- prefix in Ancient Greek \u0394\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (Di\u1e53nusos; /di.\u00f3.ny\u02d0.sos/) has been associated since antiquity with Zeus (genitive Dios), and the variants of the name seem to point to an original *Dios-nysos. The earliest attestation is the Mycenaean Greek dative form \ud800\udc07\ud800\udc42\ud800\udc55\ud800\udc12 (di-wo-nu-so), featured on two tablets that had been found at Mycenaean Pylos and dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century BC. At that time, there could be no certainty on whether this was indeed a theonym, but the 1989\u201390 Greek-Swedish Excavations at Kastelli Hill, Chania, unearthed, inter alia, four artefacts bearing Linear B inscriptions; among them, the inscription on item KH Gq 5 is thought to confirm Dionysus's early worship.The second element -n\u016bsos is of unknown origin. It is perhaps associated with Mount Nysa, the birthplace of the god in Greek mythology, where he was nursed by nymphs (the Nysiads), although Pherecydes of Syros had postulated n\u0169sa as an archaic word for \"tree\" by the sixth century BC. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, since all attempts to find an Indo-European etymology have failed.\n\n\n=== Meaning and variants ===\nLater variants include Dion\u016bsos and Di\u014dn\u016bsos in Boeotia;  Dien(n)\u016bsos in Thessaly; Deon\u016bsos and Deun\u016bsos in Ionia; and Dinn\u016bsos in Aeolia, besides other variants. A Dio- prefix is found in other names, such as that of the Dioscures, and may derive from Dios, the genitive of the name of Zeus.Nonnus, in his Dionysiaca, writes that the name Dionysus means \"Zeus-limp\" and that Hermes named the new born Dionysus this, \"because Zeus while he carried his burden lifted one foot with a limp from the weight of his thigh, and nysos in Syracusan language means limping\". In his note to these lines, W. H. D. Rouse writes \"It need hardly be said that these etymologies are wrong\". The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia based on classical sources, states that Dionysus was so named \"from accomplishing [\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ] for each of those who live the wild life. Or from providing [\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd ] everything for those who live the wild life.\"\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nAcademics in the nineteenth century, using study of philology and comparative mythology, often regarded Dionysus as a foreign deity who was only reluctantly accepted into the standard Greek pantheon at a relatively late date, based on his myths which often involve this theme \u2013 a god who spends much of his time on earth abroad, and struggles for acceptance when he returns to Greece. However, more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture. The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from Mycenaean Greece, specifically in and around the Palace of Nestor in Pylos, dated to around 1300 BC. The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant, and most evidence comes in the form only of his name, written as di-wo-nu-su-jo (\"Dionysoio\") in Linear B, preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine, which was described as being \"of Dionysoio\". References have also been uncovered to \"women of Oinoa\", the \"place of wine\", who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods.Other Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther, who was the son of Zeus, and to whom oxen were sacrificed. The link to both Zeus and oxen, as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name Liber Pater, indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus. According to K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi, these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC, the core religion of Dionysus was in place, as were his important myths. At Knossos in Minoan Crete, men were often given the name \"Pentheus\", who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means \"suffering\". Ker\u00e9nyi argued that to give such a name to one's child implies a strong religious connection, potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus' followers in later myths, but as an epithet of Dionysus himself, whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it. According to Ker\u00e9nyi, the title of \"man who suffers\" likely originally referred to the god himself, only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed.\nThe oldest known image of Dionysus, accompanied by his name, is found on a dinos by the Attic potter Sophilos around 570 BC. By the seventh century, iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine. He was associated with weddings, death, sacrifice, and sexuality, and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established. A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis, at the hand of the god, of his followers into hybrid creatures, usually represented by both tame and wild satyrs, representing the transition from civilized life back to nature as a means of escape.\n\n\n== Epithets ==\n\nDionysus was variably known with the following epithets:\nAcratophorus, \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\"giver of unmixed wine\"), at Phigaleia in Arcadia.Acroreites at Sicyon.Adoneus, a rare archaism in Roman literature, a Latinised form of Adonis, used as epithet for Bacchus.Aegobolus \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Goat-shooter\") at Potniae, in Boeotia.Aesymnetes \u0391\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (\u201cruler\" or \"lord\") at Aro\u00eb and Patrae in Achaea.\nAgrios \u1f0c\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\u201cwild\"), in Macedonia.\nAndrogynos \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (androgynous in intercourse) referring to the god in sexual intercourse, doing both the active Male role and the passive Female one.Bassareus, \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 a Thracian name for Dionysus, which derives from bassaris or \"fox-skin\", which item was worn by his cultists in their mysteries.Briseus \u0392\u03c1\u1fd1\u03c3\u03b5\u1f50\u03c2 (\"he who prevails\") in Smyrna.Bromios \u0392\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Roaring\" as of the wind, primarily relating to the central death/resurrection element of the myth, but also the god's transformations into lion and bull, and the boisterousness of those who drink alcohol. Also cognate with the \"roar of thunder\", which refers to Dionysus' father, Zeus \"the thunderer\".)\nChoiropsalas \u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 (\"pig-plucker\": Greek \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 = \"pig,\" also used as a slang term for the female genitalia).

In Eleusis, he is known as a son of Zeus and Demeter. The name \"Iacchus\" may come from the \u0399\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (Iakchos), a hymn sung in honor of Dionysus.\nLiknites (\"he of the winnowing fan\"), as a fertility god connected with mystery religions. A winnowing fan was used to separate the chaff from the grain.\nLyaeus, or Lyaios (\u039b\u03c5\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, \"deliverer\", literally \"loosener\"), one who releases from care and anxiety.Melanaigis \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03b3\u03b9\u03c2 (\"of the black goatskin\") at the Apaturia festival.\nMorychus \u039c\u03cc\u03c1\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, (\"smeared\") in Sicily, because his icon was smeared with wine lees at the vintage.Mystes \u039c\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (\u201cOf the Mysteries\u201d)\nNysian N\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, according to Philostratus, he was called like this by the ancient Indians. Most probably, because according to legend he founded the city of Nysa.Oeneus, \u039f\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c8 (\u201cWine-Dark\u201d) as god of the wine press.Omadios (\u201cFlesh-Eater\u201d), Eusebius writes in Preparation for the Gospel that, Euelpis of Carystus states that, in Chios and Tenedos they did human sacrifice to Dionysus Omadios.Pseudanor \u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1 (literally \"false man\", referring to his feminine qualities), in Macedonia.\nTauros \u03a4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\u201cA bull\u201d), occurs as a surname of Dionysus.In the Greek pantheon, Dionysus (along with Zeus) absorbs the role of Sabazios, a Thracian/Phrygian deity. In the Roman pantheon, Sabazius became an alternative name for Bacchus.\n\n\n== Worship and festivals in Greece ==\n\nDionysus worship became firmly established by the seventh century BC. He may have been worshiped as early as c. 1500\u20131100 BC by Mycenaean Greeks; and traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete.\n\n\n=== Dionysia ===\nThe Dionysia, Haloa , Ascolia and Lenaia festivals were dedicated to Dionysus. The Rural Dionysia (or Lesser Dionysia) was one of the oldest festivals dedicated to Dionysus, begun in Attica, and probably celebrated the cultivation of vines. It was held during the winter month of Poseideon (the time surrounding the winter solstice, modern December or January). The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession, during which participants carried phalluses, long loaves of bread, jars of water and wine as well as other offerings, and young girls carried baskets. The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions.The City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia) took place in urban centers such as Athens and Eleusis, and was a later development, probably beginning during the sixth century BC. Held three months after the Rural Dionysia, the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion (modern March or April). The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations, but more elaborate, and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus, and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses. The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights, and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories.\n\n\n=== Anthestria ===\nAnthestria (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1) was an Athenian festival that celebrated the beginning of spring. It spanned three days: Pithoigia (\u03a0\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, \u201cJar-Opening\u201d), Choes (\u03a7\u03bf\u03b1\u03af, \u201cThe Pouring\u201d) and Chythroi (\u03a7\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u201cThe-Pots\u201d). It was said the dead arose from the underworld during the span of the festival. Along with the souls of the dead, the Keres also wandered through the city and had to be banished when the festival ended. On the first day, Wine vats were opened. The wine was opened and mixed in honour of the god. The rooms and the drinking vessels were adorned with flowers along with children over three years of age.On the second day, a solemn ritual for Dionysus occurred along with drinking. People dressed up, sometimes as members of Dionysus\u2019s entourage of Dionysus, and visited others. Choes was also the occasion of a solemn and secret ceremony. In one of the sanctuaries of Dionysus in the Lenaeum, which for the rest of the year was closed. The basilissa (or basilinna), wife of the basileus, underwent through a symbolic ceremonial marriage to the god, possibly representing a Hieros gamos. The basilissa was assisted by fourteen Athenian matrons (called Gerarai) who were chosen by the basileus and sworn to secrecy.The last day was dedicated to the dead. Offerings were also offered to Hermes, due to his connection to the underworld. It was considered a day of merrymaking. Some poured Libations on the tombs of deceased relatives. Chythroi ended with a ritual cry intended to order the souls of the dead to return to the underworld. Keres were also banished from the festival on the last day.To protect themselves from evil, people chewed leaves of whitethorn and smeared their doors with tar to protect themselves. The festival also allowed servants and slaves to join in on the festivites.\n\n\n=== Bacchic mysteries ===\n\nThe central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or Dionysian Mysteries. The exact origin of this religion is unknown, though Orpheus was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus. Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar Orphic Mysteries actually belong to Dionysian mysteries. Some scholars have suggested that, additionally, there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of Persephone, but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion, and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it. Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion, the major urban center of Athens played a major role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries.The Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people's lives; originally primarily for men and male sexuality, but later also created space for ritualizing women's changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman's life. This was often symbolized by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change, such as Hades and Persephone, but also with Dionysus' mother Semele, who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries.The religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls, and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god. In some instances, records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar, pole, or tree is used, while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship, and these symbols have been found together at a Minoan tomb near Phaistos in Crete.\n\n\n=== Eleusinian mysteries ===\n\nAs early as the fifth century BC, Dionysus became identified with Iacchus, a minor deity from the tradition of the Eleusinian mysteries. This association may have arisen because of the homophony of the names Iacchus and Bacchus. Two black-figure lekythoi (c. 500 BC), possibly represent the earliest evidence for such an association. The nearly-identical vases, one in Berlin, the other in Rome, depict Dionysus, along with the inscription IAKXNE, a possible miswriting of IAKXE. More early evidence can be found in the works of the fifth-century BC Athenian tragedians Sophocles and Euripides. In Sophocles' Antigone (c. 441 BC), an ode to Dionysus begins by addressing Dionysus as the \"God of many names\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5), who rules over the glens of Demeter's Eleusis, and ends by identifying him with \"Iacchus the Giver\", who leads \"the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire\" and whose \"attendant Thyiads\" dance in \"night-long frenzy\". And in a fragment from a lost play, Sophocles describes Nysa, Dionysus' traditional place of nurture: \"From here I caught sight of Nysa, haunt of Bacchus, famed among mortals, which Iacchus of the bull's horns counts as his beloved nurse\". In Euripides' Bacchae (c. 405 BC), a messenger, describing the Bacchic revelries on mount Cithaeron, associates Iacchus with Bromius, another of the names of Dionysus, saying, they \"began to wave the thyrsos ... calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice.\"An inscription found on a stone stele (c. 340 BC), found at Delphi, contains a paean to Dionysus, which describes his travels. From Thebes, where he was born, he first went to Delphi where he displayed his \"starry body\", and with \"Delphian girls\" took his \"place on the folds of Parnassus\", then next to Eleusis, where he is called \"Iacchus\":\n\nAnd in your hand brandishing your night-\nlighting flame, with god-possessed frenzy\nyou went to the vales of Eleusis\n...\nwhere the whole people of Hellas'\nland, alongside your own native witnesses\nof the holy mysteries, calls upon you\nas Iacchus: for mortals from their pains\nyou have opened a haven without toils.Strabo, says that Greeks \"give the name 'Iacchus' not only to Dionysus but also to the leader-in-chief of the mysteries\". In particular, Iacchus was identified with the Orphic Dionysus, who was a son of Persephone. Sophocles mentions \"Iacchus of the bull's horns\", and according to the first-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus, it was this older Dionysus who was represented in paintings and sculptures with horns, because he \"excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed\". Arrian, the second-century Greek historian, wrote that it was to this Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone, \"not the Theban Dionysus, that the mystic chant 'Iacchus' is sung\". The second-century poet Lucian also referred to the \"dismemberment of Iacchus\".The fourth- or fifth-century poet Nonnus associated the name Iacchus with the \"third\" Dionysus. He described the Athenian celebrations given to the first Dionysus Zagreus, son of Persephone, the second Dionysus Bromios, son of Semele, and the third Dionysus Iacchus:\n\nThey [the Athenians] honoured him as a god next after the son of Persephoneia, and after Semele's son; they established sacrifices for Dionysos late born and Dionysos first born, and third they chanted a new hymn for Iacchos. In these three celebrations Athens held high revel; in the dance lately made, the Athenians beat the step in honour of Zagreus and Bromios and Iacchos all together.By some accounts, Iacchus was the husband of Demeter. Several other sources identify Iacchus as Demeter's son. The earliest such source, a fourth-century BC vase fragment at Oxford, shows Demeter holding the child Dionysus on her lap. By the first-century BC, Demeter suckling Iacchus had become such a common motif, that the Latin poet Lucretius could use it as an apparently recognizable example of a lover's euphemism. A scholiast on the second-century AD Aristides, explicitly names Demeter as Iacchus' mother.\n\n\n=== Orphism ===\n\nIn the Orphic tradition, the \"first Dionysus\" was the son of Zeus and Persephone, and was dismembered by the Titans before being reborn. Dionysus was the patron god of the Orphics, who they connected to death and immortality, and he symbolized the one who guides the process of reincarnation.The Orphic Dionysus is sometimes referred to with the alternate name Zagreus (Greek: \u0396\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2). The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god. Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades, as either Hades' son or Hades himself. Noting \"Hades' identity as Zeus' katachthonios alter ego\", Timothy Gantz thought it likely that Zagreus, originally, perhaps, the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone. However, no known Orphic sources use the name \"Zagreus\" to refer to the Orphic Dionysus. It is possible that the association between the two was known by the third century BC, when the poet Callimachus may have written about it in a now-lost source. Callimachus, as well as his contemporary Euphorion, told the story of the dismembered of the infant Dionysus, and Byzantine sources quote Callimachus as referring to the birth of a \"Dionysos Zagreus\", explaining that Zagreus was the poets' name for the chthonic aspect of Dionysus. The earliest definitive reference to the belief that Zagreus is another name for the Orphic Dionysus is found in the late first century writings of Plutarch. The fifth century Greek poet Nonnus' Dionysiaca tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus, in which Nonnus calls him the \"older Dionysos ... illfated Zagreus\", \"Zagreus the horned baby\", \"Zagreus, the first Dionysos\", \"Zagreus the ancient Dionysos\", and \"Dionysos Zagreus\".\n\n\n== Worship and festivals in Rome ==\n\n\n=== Liber and importation to Rome ===\n\nThe mystery cult of Bacchus was brought to Rome from the Greek culture of southern Italy or by way of Greek-influenced Etruria. It was established around 200 BC in the Aventine grove of Stimula by a priestess from Campania, near the temple where Liber Pater (\"the Free Father\") had a State-sanctioned, popular cult. Liber was a native Roman god of wine, fertility, and prophecy, patron of Rome's plebeians (citizen-commoners), and one of the members of the Aventine Triad, along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera. A temple to the Triad was erected on the Aventine Hill in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of Liberalia. The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence, and by 205 BC, Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and Proserpina. Liber was often interchangeably identified with Dionysus and his mythology, though this identification was not universally accepted. Cicero insisted on the \"non-identity of Liber and Dionysus\" and described Liber and Libera as children of Ceres.Liber, like his Aventine companions, carried various aspects of his older cults into official Roman religion. He protected various aspects of agriculture and fertility, including the vine and the \"soft seed\" of its grapes, wine and wine vessels, and male fertility and virility. Pliny called Liber \"the first to establish the practice of buying and selling; he also invented the diadem, the emblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession.\" Roman mosaics and sarcophagi attest to various representations of a Dionysus-like exotic triumphal procession. In Roman and Greek literary sources from the late Republic and Imperial era, several notable triumphs feature similar, distinctively \"Bacchic\" processional elements, recalling the supposedly historic \"Triumph of Liber\".Liber and Dionysus may have had a connection that predated Classical Greece and Rome, in the form of the Mycenaean god Eleutheros, who shared the lineage and iconography of Dionysus but whose name has the same meaning as Liber. Before the importation of the Greek cults, Liber was already strongly associated with Bacchic symbols and values, including wine and uninhibited freedom, as well as the subversion of the powerful. Several depictions from the late Republic era feature processions, depicting the \"Triumph of Liber\".\n\n\n=== Bacchanalia ===\n\nIn Rome, the most well-known festivals of Bacchus were the Bacchanalia, based on the earlier Greek Dionysia festivals. These Bacchic rituals were said to have included omophagic practices, such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw. This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus, but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced \"enthusiasm\": etymologically, to let a god enter the practitioner's body or to have her become one with Bacchus.In Livy's account, the Bacchic mysteries were a novelty at Rome; originally restricted to women and held only three times a year, they were corrupted by an Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken, disinhibited men and women of all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five times a month. Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and traditional morality (mos maiorum); a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. Livy's sources, and his own account of the cult, probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic genre known as \"Satyr plays\", based on Greek originals. The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, Those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.\nBacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber, and his festival was inserted into the Liberalia. In Roman culture, Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents. Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth, Bacchus became euhemerised as a historical hero, conqueror, and founder of cities. He was a patron deity and founding hero at Leptis Magna, birthplace of the emperor Septimius Severus, who promoted his cult. In some Roman sources, the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger-drawn chariot, surrounded by maenads, satyrs and drunks, commemorates the god's triumphant return from the conquest of India. Pliny believed this to be the historical prototype for the Roman Triumph.\n\n\n== Post-classical worship ==\n\n\n=== Late Antiquity ===\nIn the Neoplatonist philosophy and religion of Late Antiquity, the Olympian gods were sometimes considered to number 12 based on their spheres of influence. For example, according to Sallustius, \"Jupiter, Neptune, and Vulcan fabricate the world; Ceres, Juno, and Diana animate it; Mercury, Venus, and Apollo harmonize it; and, lastly, Vesta, Minerva, and Mars preside over it with a guarding power.\" The multitude of other gods, in this belief system, subsist within the primary gods, and Sallustius taught that Bacchus subsisted in Jupiter.In the Orphic tradition, a saying was supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo that stated \"Zeus, Hades, [and] Helios-Dionysus\" were \"three gods in one godhead.\" This statement apparently conflated Dionysus not only with Hades, but also his father Zeus, and implied a particularly close identification with the sun-god Helios. When quoting this in his Hymn to King Helios, Emperor Julian substituted Dionysus' name with that of Serapis, whose Egyptian counterpart Osiris was also identified with Dionysus.\n\n\n=== Worship from the Middle Ages to the Modern period ===\n\nThough the last known worshippers of the Greek and Roman gods were converted before 1000 AD, there were several isolated instances of revived worship of Dionysus during the Medieval and early modern periods. With the rise of modern neopaganism and Hellenic polytheism, worship of the god has once again been revived.\nAccording to the Lanercost chronicle, during Easter in 1282 in Scotland, the parish priest of Inverkeithing led young women in a dance in honor of Priapus and Father Liber, commonly identified with Dionysus. The priest danced and sang at the front, carrying a representation of the phallus on a pole. He was killed by a Christian mob later that year. Historian C. S. Watkins believes that Richard of Durham, the author of the chronicle, identified an occurrence of apotropaic magic with his knowledge of ancient Greek religion, rather than recording an actual case of survival of pagan rituals.The late medieval Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho secretly advocated in favor of a return to paganism in medieval Greece.In the eighteenth century, Hellfire Clubs sprung up in Britain and Ireland. Though activities varied between the clubs, some of them were very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices. Dionysus was one of the most popular deities, alongside deities like Venus and Flora. Today one can still see the statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves.In 1820, Ephraim Lyon founded the Church of Bacchus in Eastford, Connecticut. He declared himself High Priest, and added local drunks to the list of membership. He maintained that those who died as members would go to a Bacchanalia for their afterlife.Modern pagan and polytheist groups often include worship of Dionysus in their traditions and practices, most prominently groups which have sought to revive Hellenic polytheism, such as the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes (YSEE). In addition to libations of wine, modern worshipers of Dionysus offer the god grape vines, ivy, and various forms of incense, particularly styrax. They may also celebrate Roman festivals such as the Liberalia (March 17, close to the Spring Equinox) or Bacchanalia (Various dates), and various Greek festivals such as the Anthesteria, Lenaia, and the Greater and Lesser Dionysias, the dates of which are calculated by the lunar calendar.\n\n\n== Identification with other gods ==\n\n\n=== Osiris ===\n\nIn the Greek interpretation of the Egyptian pantheon, Dionysus was often identified with Osiris. Stories of the dismemberment of Osiris and the re-assembly and resurrection by Isis closely parallel those of the Orphic Dionysus and Demeter. According to Diodorus Siculus, as early as the fifth century BC, the two gods had been syncretized as a single deity known as Dionysus-Osiris. The most notable record of this belief is found in Herodotus' 'Histories'. Plutarch also described his belief that Osiris and Dionysus were identical, stating that anyone familiar with the secret rituals associated with both gods would recognize obvious parallels, and that their dismemberment myths and associated public symbols are enough additional evidence that they are the same god worshiped by two different cultures.Other syncretic Greco-Egyptian deities arose out of this conflation, including with the gods Serapis and Hermanubis. Serapis was believed to be both Hades and Osiris, and the Roman Emperor Julian considered him the same as Dionysus as well. Dionysus-Osiris was particularly popular in Ptolemaic Egypt, as the Ptolemies claimed descent from Dionysus, and as Pharaoes they had claim to the lineage of Osiris. This association was most notable during a deification ceremony where Mark Antony became Dionysus-Osiris, alongside Cleopatra as Isis-Aphrodite.Egyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris, killed him, divided his body into equal parts, and \"slipped them secretly out of the house\". All but Osiris' penis, which since none of them \"was willing to take it with him\", they threw into the river. Isis, Osiris' wife, hunted down and killed the Titans, reassembled Osiris' body parts \"into the shape of a human figure\", and gave them \"to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god\". But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests \"to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position.\"\n\n\n=== Hades ===\n\nThe fifth\u2013fourth century BC philosopher Heraclitus, unifying opposites, declared that Hades and Dionysus, the very essence of indestructible life (zo\u00eb), are the same god. Among other evidence, Karl Ker\u00e9nyi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn \"To Demeter\", votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus. He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine, as she states that it would be against themis for her to drink wine, which is the gift of Dionysus, after Persephone's abduction, because of this association; indicating that Hades may in fact have been a \"cover name\" for the underworld Dionysus. He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries. One of the epithets of Dionysus was \"Chthonios\", meaning \"the subterranean\".Evidence for a cult connection is quite extensive, particularly in southern Italy, especially when considering the heavy involvement of death symbolism included in Dionysian worship; statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis gives further evidence as the statues found bear a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus, also called Aides Kyanochaites (Hades of the flowing dark hair), known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the Underworld. The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness Ancient portrayals show Dionysus holding in his hand the kantharos, a wine-jar with large handles, and occupying the place where one would expect to see Hades. Archaic artist Xenocles portrayed on one side of a vase, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, each with his emblems of power; with Hades' head turned back to front and, on the other side, Dionysus striding forward to meet his bride Persephone, with the kantharos in his hand, against a background of grapes. Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as Chthonios, Eubouleus and Euclius.\nBoth Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus. Zeus, like Dionysus, was occasionally believed to have an underworld form, closely identified with Hades, to the point that they were occasionally thought of as the same god.According to Marguerite Rigoglioso, Hades is Dionysus, and this dual god was believed by the Eleusinian tradition to have impregnated Persephone. This would bring the Eleusinian in harmony with the myth in which Zeus, not Hades, impregnated Persephone to bear the first Dionysus. Rigoglioso argues that taken together, these myths suggest a belief that is that, with Persephone, Zeus/Hades/Dionysus created (in terms quoted from Ker\u00e9nyi) \"a second, a little Dionysus,\" who is also a \"subterranean Zeus.\" The unification of Hades, Zeus, and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the 'shining' realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades. According to Rosemarie Taylor-Perry, \"it is often mentioned that Zeus, Hades and Dionysus were all attributed to being the exact same god... Being a tripartite deity Hades is also Zeus, doubling as being the Sky God or Zeus, Hades abducts his 'daughter' and paramour Persephone. The taking of Kore by Hades is the act which allows the conception and birth of a second integrating force: Iacchos (Zagreus-Dionysus), also known as Liknites, the helpless infant form of that Deity who is the unifier of the dark underworld (chthonic) realm of Hades and the Olympian (\"Shining\") one of Zeus.\"\n\n\n=== Sabazios and Yahweh ===\n\nThe Phrygian god Sabazios was alternately identified with Zeus or with Dionysus. The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, Suda (c. tenth century), stated: Sabazios ... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry \"sabazein\". Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry \"sabasmos\"; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call \"saboi\" those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes ... Demosthenes [in the speech] \"On Behalf of Ktesiphon\" [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.\nStrabo, in the first century, linked Sabazios with Zagreus among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos. Strabo's Sicilian contemporary, Diodorus Siculus, conflated Sabazios with the secret Dionysus, born of Zeus and Persephone, However, this connection is not supported by any surviving inscriptions, which are entirely to Zeus Sabazios.Several ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the Jewish people, Yahweh, was identifiable as Dionysus or Liber via his identification with Sabazios. Tacitus, Lydus, Cornelius Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief (though some, like Tacitus, specifically brought it up in order to reject it). According to Plutarch, one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words \"Euoe\" and \"Sabi\", a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius. According to scholar Sean McDonough, it is possible that Plutarch's sources had confused the cry of \"Iao Sabaoth\" (typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh) with the Sabazian cry of \"Euoe Saboe\", originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities. The cry of \"Sabi\" could also have been conflated with the Jewish term \"sabbath\", adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus/Sabazius were the same deity. Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the Maccabees that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes, vine leaves, and cups. However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus/Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to 55 BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled \"Bacchus Judaeus\" (BACCHIVS IVDAEVS), and in 139 BC praetor Cornelius Scipio Hispalus deported Jewish people for attempting to \"infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius\".\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\nVarious different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage, birth, and life of Dionysus on earth, complicated by his several rebirths. By the first century BC, some mythographers had attempted to harmonize the various accounts of Dionysus' birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births, but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes. The historian Diodorus Siculus said that according to \"some writers of myths\" there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone, but that the \"younger one also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.\" He also said that Dionysus \"was thought to have two forms...the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, the younger one being youthful and effeminate and young.\"\n\nThough the varying genealogy of Dionysus was mentioned in many works of classical literature, only a few contain the actual narrative myths surrounding the events of his multiple births. These include the first century BC Bibliotheca historica by Greek historian Diodorus, which describes the birth and deeds of the three incarnations of Dionysus; the brief birth narrative given by the first century AD Roman author Hyginus, which describes a double birth for Dionysus; and a longer account in the form of Greek poet Nonnus's epic Dionysiaca, which discusses three incarnations of Dionysus similar to Diodorus' account, but which focuses on the life of the third Dionysus, born to Zeus and Semele.\n\n\n=== First birth ===\nThough Diodorus mentions some traditions which state an older, Indian or Egyptian Dionysus existed who invented wine, no narratives are given of his birth or life among mortals, and most traditions ascribe the invention of wine and travels through India to the last Dionysus. According to Diodorus, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and Persephone (or alternately, Zeus and Demeter). This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts, and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics, who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. Nonnus calls this Dionysus Zagreus, while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with Sabazius. However, unlike Hyginus and Nonnus, Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god. It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how to use oxen to plow the fields, rather than doing so by hand. His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns.\n\nThe Greek poet Nonnus gives a birth narrative for Dionysus in his late fourth or early fifth century AD epic Dionysiaca. In it, he described how Zeus \"intended to make a new Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos\" who was the Egyptian god Osiris. (Dionysiaca 4) Zeus took the shape of a serpent (\"drakon\"), and \"ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia.\" According to Nonnus, though Persephone was \"the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld\", she remained a virgin, and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors, because \"all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid.\" (Dionysiaca 5) After her union with Zeus, Perseophone's womb \"swelled with living fruit\", and she gave birth to a horned baby, named Zagreus. Zagreus, despite his infancy, was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts, marking him a Zeus' heir. Hera saw this and alerted the Titans, who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus \"while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror.\" They attacked him. However, according to Nonnus, \"where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos.\" He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack, including Zeus, Kronos, a baby, and \"a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black.\" He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans, including a lion, a wild horse, a horned serpent, a tiger, and, finally, a bull. Hera intervened, killing the bull with a shout, and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in Tartaros. This caused the mother of the Titans, Gaia, to suffer, and her symptoms were seen across the whole world, resulting in fires and floods, and boiling seas. Zeus took pity on her, and in order to cool down the burning land, he caused great rains to flood the world. (Dionysiaca 6)\n\n\n==== Interpretation ====\n\nIn the Orphic tradition, Dionysus was, in part, a god associated with the underworld. As a result, the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone, and believed that he had been dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. The myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus was alluded to as early as the fourth century BC by Plato in his Phaedo, in which Socrates claims that the initiations of the Dionysian Mysteries are similar to those of the philosophic path. Late Neoplatonists such as Damascius explored the implications of this at length. The dismemberment of Dionysus (the sparagmos) is often considered to be the most important myth of Orphism.Many modern sources identify this \"Orphic Dionysus\" with the god Zagreus, though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics, who simply called him Dionysus. As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. The infant was taken to Mount Ida, where, like the infant Zeus, he was guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful scepter.As Diodorus relates, one school of thought holds that Dionysus was not literally born on earth at all, but rather, his birth narrative is an allegory for the generative power of the gods at work in nature. In this account, Dionysus is said to be the son of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture. When the \"Sons of Gaia\" (i.e. the Titans) boiled Dionysus following his birth, Demeter gathered together his remains, allowing his rebirth. Diodorus noted the symbolism this myth held for its adherents: Dionysus, god of the vine, was born from the gods of the rain and the earth. He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia, or \"earth born\", symbolizing the harvesting and wine-making process. Just as the remains of the bare vines are returned to the earth to restore its fruitfulness, the remains of the young Dionysus were returned to Demeter allowing him to be born again.\n\n\n=== Second birth ===\n\nThe birth narrative given by Gaius Julius Hyginus (c. 64 BC \u2013 17 AD) in Fabulae 167, agrees with the Orphic tradition that Liber (Dionysus) was originally the son of Jove (Zeus) and Proserpine (Persephone). Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans, so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to Semele, the daughter of Harmonia and Cadmus, king and founder of Thebes. This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant. Juno appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse, Beroe, and told her: \"Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.\" When Semele requested that Jove do so, she was killed by a thunderbolt. Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb, and put him in the care of Nysus. Hyginus states that \"for this reason he is called Dionysus, and also the one with two mothers\" (dim\u0113t\u014dr).Nonnus describes how, when life was rejuvenated after the flood, it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus. \"The Seasons, those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking. Without Bacchos to inspire the dance, its grace was only half complete and quite without profit; it charmed only the eyes of the company, when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps, having only nods for words, hand for mouth, fingers for voice.\" Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine, to alleviate their toil, war, and suffering. After he became protector of humanity, Zeus promises, Dionysus would struggle on earth, but be received \"by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars.\" (Dionysiaca 7).\n\nThe mortal princess Semele then had a dream, in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning, but did not harm the fruit. He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits, and sewed it into his thigh, so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus. She saw the bull-shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh, and then came to the realization that she herself had been the tree. Her father Cadmus, fearful of the prophetic dream, instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus. Zeus came to Semele in her bed, adorned with various symbols of Dionysus. He transformed into a snake, and \"Zeus made long wooing, and shouted \"Euoi!\" as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry.\" Immediately, Semele's bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers, and the earth laughed. Zeus then spoke to Semele, revealing his true identity, and telling her to be happy: \"you bring forth a son who shall not die, and you I will call immortal. Happy woman! you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles, you shall bring forth joy for gods and men.\" (Dionysiaca 7).During her pregnancy, Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine. She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy, and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music. Hera became envious, and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus. She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus' wet nurse. She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus' gave to Hera, compared with their own brief liaison, and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood. Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself. Zeus answered her prayers, but warned her than no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts. Semele reached out to touch them, and was burnt to ash. (Dionysiaca 8). But the infant Dionysus survived, and Zeus rescued him from the flames, sewing him into his thigh. \"So the rounded thigh in labour became female, and the boy too soon born was brought forth, but not in a mother\u2019s way, having passed from a mother\u2019s womb to a father\u2019s.\" (Dionysiaca 9). At his birth, he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon. The Seasons crowned him with ivy and flowers, and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns.An alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition. In it, Dionysus is the son of Ammon, who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi-historical king of Libya. Ammon had married the goddess Rhea, but he had an affair with Amaltheia, who bore Dionysus. Ammon feared Rhea's wrath if she were to discover the child, so he took the infant Dionysus to Nysa (Dionysus' traditional childhood home). Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa, a daughter of the hero Aristaeus. Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts, his beauty, and his strength. It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood. His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea, who was furious with Ammon for his deception. She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but, unable to do so, she left Ammon and married Cronus.\n\n\n==== Interpretation ====\n\nEven in antiquity, the account of Dionysus' birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time, a suggestion of Euhemerism (an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history) often applied to demi-gods. The fourth century Roman emperor and philosopher Julian encountered examples of this belief, and wrote arguments against it. In his letter To the Cynic Heracleios, Julian wrote \"I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele, and that he became a god through his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries, and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus.\" However, to Julian, the myth of Dionysus's birth (and that of Heracles) stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth. The birth of Dionysus, Julian argues, was \"no birth but a divine manifestation\" to Semele, who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear. However, Semele was impatient for the god to come, and began revealing his mysteries too early; for her transgression, she was struck down by Zeus. When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity, for it to \"pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life\", he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible, spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals. In Julian's interpretation, the Greeks \"called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made, but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.\" The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus, per Julian, was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world, but entering into it, though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the intelligible realm.\n\n\n=== Infancy ===\n\nAccording to Nonnus, Zeus gave the infant Dionysus to the care of Hermes. Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides, or daughters of Lamos, who were river nymphs. But Hera drove the Lamides mad, and caused them to attack Dionysus, who was rescued by Hermes. Hermes next brought the infant to Ino for fostering by her attendant Mystis, who taught him the rites of the mysteries (Dionysiaca 9). In Apollodorus' account, Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl, in order to hide him from Hera's wrath. However, Hera found him, and vowed to destroy the house with a flood; however, Hermes again rescued Dionysus, this time bringing him to the mountains of Lydia. Hermes adopted the form of Phanes, most ancient of the gods, and so Hera bowed before him and let him pass. Hermes gave the infant to the goddess Rhea, who cared for him through his adolescence.Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars (see Hyades star cluster). In yet another version of the myth, he is raised by his cousin Macris on the island of Euboea.\n\nDionysus in Greek mythology is a god of foreign origin, and while Mount Nysa is a mythological location, it is invariably set far away to the east or to the south. The Homeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus places it \"far from Phoenicia, near to the Egyptian stream\". Others placed it in Anatolia, or in Libya (\"away in the west beside a great ocean\"), in Ethiopia (Herodotus), or Arabia (Diodorus Siculus).\nAccording to Herodotus:\n\nAs it is, the Greek story has it that no sooner was Dionysus born than Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to Nysa in Ethiopia beyond Egypt; and as for Pan, the Greeks do not know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge.\nThe Bibliotheca seems to be following Pherecydes, who relates how the infant Dionysus, god of the grapevine, was nursed by the rain-nymphs, the Hyades at Nysa. Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the centaur Chiron. According to Ptolemy Chennus in the Library of Photius, \"Dionysus was loved by Chiron, from whom he learned chants and dances, the bacchic rites and initiations.\"\n\n\n=== Travels and invention of wine ===\n\nWhen Dionysus grew up, he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice, being the first to do so; but Hera struck him with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Cybele, better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted several years. According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.\nAnother myth according to Nonnus involves Ampelus, a satyr, who was loved by Dionysus.  As related by Ovid, Ampelus became the constellation Vindemitor, or the \"grape-gatherer\": ...not so will the Grape-gatherer escape thee. The origin of that constellation also can be briefly told. 'Tis said that the unshorn Ampelus, son of a nymph and a satyr, was loved by Bacchus on the Ismarian hills. Upon him the god bestowed a vine that trailed from an elm's leafy boughs, and still the vine takes from the boy its name. While he rashly culled the gaudy grapes upon a branch, he tumbled down; Liber bore the lost youth to the stars.\" Another story of Ampelus was related by Nonnus: in an accident foreseen by Dionysus, the youth was killed while riding a bull maddened by the sting of a gadfly sent by At\u00eb, the Goddess of Folly. The Fates granted Ampelus a second life as a vine, from which Dionysus squeezed the first wine.\n\n\n=== Return to Greece ===\n\nReturning in triumph to Greece after his travels in Asia, Dionysus came to be considered the founder of the triumphal procession. He undertook efforts to introduce his religion into Greece, but was opposed by rulers who feared it, on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it.\n\nIn one myth, adapted in Euripides' play The Bacchae, Dionysus returns to his birthplace, Thebes, which is ruled by his cousin Pentheus. Pentheus, as well as his mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autonoe, disbelieve Dionysus' divine birth. Despite the warnings of the blind prophet Tiresias, they deny him worship and denounce him for inspiring the women of Thebes to madness.\nDionysus uses his divine powers to drive Pentheus insane, then invites him to spy on the ecstatic rituals of the Maenads, in the woods of Mount Cithaeron. Pentheus, hoping to witness a sexual orgy, hides himself in a tree. The Maenads spot him; maddened by Dionysus, they take him to be a mountain-dwelling lion, and attack him with their bare hands. Pentheus' aunts and his mother Agave are among them, and they rip him limb from limb. Agave mounts his head on a pike, and takes the trophy to her father Cadmus. The madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes Agave and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents. Only Tiresias is spared.\n\nWhen King Lycurgus of Thrace heard that Dionysus was in his kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus' followers, the Maenads. Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis, and sent a drought which stirred the people to revolt. The god then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe in the belief that he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus lived, and his people had him drawn and quartered. Appeased by the king's death, Dionysus lifted the curse. This story is told in Homer's Iliad 6.136\u2013137. In an alternative version, sometimes depicted in art, Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia, a follower of Dionysus, who was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and slowly strangled him.\n\n\n=== Captivity and escape ===\n\nThe Homeric Hymn 7 to Dionysus recounts how, while he sat on the seashore, some sailors spotted him, believing him a prince. They attempted to kidnap him and sail away to sell him for ransom or into slavery. No rope would bind him. The god turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board, killing all in his path. Those who jumped ship were mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman, Acoetes, who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start.In a similar story, Dionysus hired a Tyrrhenian pirate ship to sail from Icaria to Naxos. When he was aboard, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia, intending to sell him as a slave. This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into dolphins. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates, but transforms to a divine adult when on board.\nMany of the Dionysus myths involve the god, whose birth was secret, defending his godhead against skeptics. Malcolm Bull notes that \"It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated\". Paola Corrente notes that in many sources, the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus' time among mortals. In that sense, it serves as final proof of his divinity, and is often followed by his descent into Hades to retrieve his mother, both of whom can then ascend into heaven to live alongside the other Olympian gods.\n\n\n=== Descent to the underworld ===\n\nPausanias, in book II of his Description of Greece, describes two variant traditions regarding Dionysus' katabasis, or descent into the underworld. Both describe how Dionysus entered into the afterlife to rescue his mother Semele, and bring her to her rightful place on Olympus. To do so, he had to contend with the hell dog Cerberus, which was restrained for him by Heracles. After retrieving Semele, Dionysus emerged with her from the unfathomable waters of a lagoon on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, according to the local tradition. This mythic event was commemorated with a yearly nighttime festival, the details of which were held secret by the local religion. According to Paola Corrente, the emergence of Dionysus from the waters of the lagoon may signify a form of rebirth for both him and Semele as they reemerged from the underworld. A variant of this myth forms the basis of Aristophanes' comedy The Frogs.According to the Christian writer Clement of Alexandria, Dionysus was guided in his journey by Prosymnus or Polymnus, who requested, as his reward, to be Dionysus' lover. Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge, so to satisfy Prosymnus' shade, Dionysus fashioned a phallus from an olive branch and sat on it at Prosymnus' tomb. This story survives in full only in Christian sources, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology, but it appears to have also served to explain the origin of secret objects used by the Dionysian Mysteries.This same myth of Dionysus' descent to the underworld is related by both Diodorus Siculus in his first century BC work Bibliotheca historica, and Pseudo-Apollodorus in the third book of his first century AD work Bibliotheca. In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess. In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.\n\n\n=== Secondary myths ===\n\n\n==== Midas' golden touch ====\nDionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father, Silenus, had gone missing. The old man had wandered away drunk, and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king Midas (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden). The king recognized him hospitably, feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward.\nMidas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone, but his joy vanished when he found that his bread, meat, and wine also turned to gold. Later, when his daughter embraced him, she too turned to gold.\nThe horrified king strove to divest the Midas Touch, and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation. The god consented, telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. As he did so, the power passed into them, and the river sands turned gold: this etiological myth explained the gold sands of the Pactolus.\n\n\n==== Other myths ====\nWhen Hephaestus bound Hera to a magical chair, Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.\nWhen Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but he committed suicide or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos, for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.\nA third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by Aristophanes in his comedy The Frogs. Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival, the Dionysia, wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians. After a poetry slam, Aeschylus is chosen in preference to Euripides.\nPsalacantha, a nymph, failed to win the love of Dionysus in preference to Ariadne, and ended up being changed into a plant.\nDionysus fell in love with a handsome satyr named Ampelos, who was killed. He was changed into a grape-vine or grape gathering constellation upon death. There are two versions of his death. In Dionysiaca, Ampelos is killed by Selene due to him challenging her. In another, recorded by Ovid, Ampelos fell and died because he was trying to pick grapes from a branch. Upon death, he is turned into a Constellation.Lycurgus [6]  was a king of Edonia in or somewhere in the region of west Asia. He drove Dionysus and his nurses fleeing from their home on Mount Nysa to seek the refuge with Thetis. Due to this, he was punished by being driven mad. He hacked apart his own wife and child because of the madness induced belief they were spreading vines, and later driven from his home and was devoured by wild beasts on Mt Pangaios.Callirrhoe was a Calydonian woman who scorned Coresus, a priest of Dionysus, who threatened to afflict all the women of Calydon with insanity (see Maenad). The priest was ordered to sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe threw herself into a well which was later named after her.\n\n\n== Lovers and offspring ==\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\n\n=== Symbols ===\n\nThe earliest cult images of Dionysus show a mature male, bearded and robed. He holds a fennel staff, tipped with a pine-cone and known as a thyrsus. Later images show him as a beardless, sensuous, naked or half-naked androgynous youth: the literature describes him as womanly or \"man-womanish\". In its fully developed form, his central cult imagery shows his triumphant, disorderly arrival or return, as if from some place beyond the borders of the known and civilized. His procession (thiasus) is made up of wild female followers (maenads) and bearded satyrs with erect penises; some are armed with the thyrsus, some dance or play music. The god himself is drawn in a chariot, usually by exotic beasts such as lions or tigers, and is sometimes attended by a bearded, drunken Silenus. This procession is presumed to be the cult model for the followers of his Dionysian Mysteries. Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and he thus symbolizes the chaotic, dangerous and unexpected, everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods.Dionysus was a god of resurrection and he was strongly linked to the bull. In a cult hymn from Olympia, at a festival for Hera, Dionysus is invited to come as a bull; \"with bull-foot raging\". Walter Burkert relates, \"Quite frequently [Dionysus] is portrayed with bull horns, and in Kyzikos he has a tauromorphic image\", and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the Titans.\n\nThe snake and phallus were symbols of Dionysus in ancient Greece, and of Bacchus in Greece and Rome. He typically wears a panther or leopard skin and carries a Thyrsus \u2013 a long stick or wand topped with a pine cone. His iconography sometimes include maenads, who wear wreaths of ivy and serpents around their hair or neck.The cult of Dionysus was closely associated with trees, specifically the fig tree, and some of his bynames exhibit this, such as  Endendros \"he in the tree\" or  Dendrit\u0113s, \"he of the tree\". Peters suggests the original meaning as \"he who runs among the trees\", or that of a \"runner in the woods\". Janda (2010) accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of \"he who impels the (world-)tree\". This interpretation explains how Nysa could have been re-interpreted from a meaning of \"tree\" to the name of a mountain: the axis mundi of Indo-European mythology is represented both as a world-tree and as a world-mountain.Dionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn. In the Mediterranean summer, marked by the rising of the dog star Sirius, the weather becomes extremely hot, but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow. Late summer, when Orion is at the center of the sky, was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece. Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy. Pindar describes the \"pure light of high summer\" as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself. An image of Dionysus' birth from Zeus' thigh call him \"the light of Zeus\" (Dios phos) and associate him with the light of Sirius.\n\n\n=== In classical art ===\n\nThe god, and still more often his followers, were commonly depicted in the painted pottery of Ancient Greece, much of which made to hold wine. But, apart from some reliefs of maenads, Dionysian subjects rarely appeared in large sculpture before the Hellenistic period, when they became common. In these, the treatment of the god himself ranged from severe archaising or Neo Attic types such as the Dionysus Sardanapalus to types showing him as an indolent and androgynous young man, often nude. Hermes and the Infant Dionysus is probably a Greek original in marble, and the Ludovisi Dionysus group is probably a Roman original of the second century AD. Well-known Hellenistic sculptures of Dionysian subjects, surviving in Roman copies, include the Barberini Faun, the Belvedere Torso, the Resting Satyr. The Furietti Centaurs and Sleeping Hermaphroditus reflect related subjects, which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit. The marble Dancer of Pergamon is an original, as is the bronze Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo, a recent recovery from the sea.\nThe Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe pastoral into which other semi-divine creatures of the countryside have been co-opted, such as centaurs, nymphs, and the gods Pan and Hermaphrodite. \"Nymph\" by this stage \"means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors, a non-wild bacchant\". Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants, many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths, and \"most should be seen as part of his realm. They have in common with satyrs and nymphs that they are creatures of the outdoors and are without true personal identity.\" The fourth-century BC Derveni Krater, the unique survival of a very large scale Classical or Hellenistic metal vessel of top quality, depicts Dionysus and his followers.\nDionysus appealed to the Hellenistic monarchies for a number of reasons, apart from merely being a god of pleasure: He was a human who became divine, he came from, and had conquered, the East, exemplified a lifestyle of display and magnificence with his mortal followers, and was often regarded as an ancestor. He continued to appeal to the rich of Imperial Rome, who populated their gardens with Dionysian sculpture, and by the second century AD were often buried in sarcophagi carved with crowded scenes of Bacchus and his entourage.The fourth-century AD Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a spectacular cage cup which changes colour when light comes through the glass; it shows the bound King Lycurgus being taunted by the god and attacked by a satyr; this may have been used for celebration of Dionysian mysteries. Elizabeth Kessler has theorized that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphos, Cyprus, details a monotheistic worship of Dionysus. In the mosaic, other gods appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally imposed Dionysus. The mid-Byzantine Veroli Casket shows the tradition lingering in Constantinople around 1000 AD, but probably not very well understood.\n\n\n== Post-classical culture ==\n\n\n=== Art from the Renaissance on ===\n\nBacchic subjects in art resumed in the Italian Renaissance, and soon became almost as popular as in antiquity, but his \"strong association with feminine spirituality and power almost disappeared\", as did \"the idea that the destructive and creative powers of the god were indissolubly linked\". In Michelangelo's statue (1496\u201397) \"madness has become merriment\". The statue aspires to suggest both drunken incapacity and an elevated consciousness, but this was perhaps lost on later viewers, and typically the two aspects were thereafter split, with a clearly drunk Silenus representing the former, and a youthful Bacchus often shown with wings, because he carries the mind to higher places.\n\nTitian's Bacchus and Ariadne (1522\u201323) and The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1523\u201326), both painted for the same room, offer an influential heroic pastoral, while Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in The Triumph of Bacchus (or Los borrachos \u2013 \"the drinkers\", c. 1629) and Jusepe de Ribera in his Drunken Silenus choose a genre realism. Flemish Baroque painting frequently painted the Bacchic followers, as in Van Dyck's Drunken Silenus and many works by Rubens; Poussin was another regular painter of Bacchic scenes.A common theme in art beginning in the sixteenth century was the depiction of Bacchus and Ceres caring for a representation of love \u2013 often Venus, Cupid, or Amore. This tradition derived from a quotation by the Roman comedian Terence (c. 195/185 \u2013 c. 159 BC) which became a popular proverb in the Early Modern period: Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus (\"without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes\"). Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period 1550\u20131630, especially in Northern Mannerism in Prague and the Low Countries, as well as by Rubens. Because of his association with the vine harvest, Bacchus became the god of autumn, and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons.\n\n\n=== Modern literature and philosophy ===\n\nDionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In The Birth of Tragedy (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterized as a \"modern myth\", as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and is not found in classical sources. However, the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great, that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship.Nietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil, and later The Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained will to power. In The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God (1904), and Dionysus and Early Dionysianism (1921), the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates the theory of Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Karl Ker\u00e9nyi characterizes Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force (Greek Zo\u00ea). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus' emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god. Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes should be kept in an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection, which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London.\nIn CS Lewis' Prince Caspian (part of The Chronicles of Narnia), Bacchus is a dangerous-looking, androgynous young boy who helps Aslan awaken the spirits of the Narnian trees and rivers. Rick Riordan's series of books Percy Jackson & The Olympians presents Dionysus as an uncaring, childish and spoiled god. In the graphic novel The Wicked + The Divine, the gods reincarnate as pop stars: Dionysus is the \"dancefloor that walks like a man\", associated with the ecstatic release of rave culture. In the novel Household Gods by Harry Turtledove and Judith Tarr, Nicole Gunther-Perrin is a lawyer in the twentieth century. She makes a libation to Liber and Libera, Roman equivalents of Dionysus and Persephone, and is transported back in time to ancient Rome. In The Secret History by Donna Tartt, a group of classics students reflect on reviving the worship of Dionysus during their time in college.\n\n\n=== Modern film and performance art ===\nWalt Disney depicted Bacchus in the \"Pastoral\" segment of the animated film Fantasia, as a Silenus-like character. In 1969, an adaption of The Bacchae was performed, called Dionysus in '69. A film was made of the same performance. The production was notable for involving audience participation, nudity, and theatrical innovations. In 1974, Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove adapted Aristophanes' comedy The Frogs into a modern musical, which hit broadway in 2004 and was revived in London in 2017. The musical keeps the descent of Dionysus into Hades to bring back a playwright; however, the playwrights are updated to modern times, and Dionysus is forced to choose between George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare.In 2006, The Orion Experience, in the album Cosmocandy includes a song titled Cult of Dionysus. The song invokes themes from the god\u2019s cult. The entire album is described as \u201cshort, sharp, and ultimately memorable, glowing with a long-forgotten disco-synth energy.\u201d The song overall plays upon the god\u2019s themes of being devious and rebelling against social norms.\nIn 2018, the Australian musical project Dead Can Dance released an album entitled Dionysus. Musician Brendan Perry described the inspiration for the album as a trance-like, \"Dionysian\" experience he had at a festival during a trip to rural Spain. \"It's the spring festivals like that one where you see the real remnants of Dionysian festivals. They're all over the Mediterranean in remote places where Christian influence hasn't been as great. ... People wear masks and dance in circles almost like time has stood still in their celebrations.\" Perry chose to employ Mediterranean folk instruments that mimic natural sounds in addition to a vocal chorus, in order to evoke the atmosphere of an ancient festival.In 2019, the South Korean boy band BTS released a rap-rock-synth-pop-hip-hop track.  named \"Dionysus\" as part of their album Map of the Soul: Persona. The naming of this song comes from the association of the namesake with debauchery and excess, this is reflected in its lyrics talking about \"getting drunk on art\" - playing on the Korean words for \"alcohol\" (\uc220 sul) and \"art\" (\uc608\uc220 yesul) as an example - alongside expressions about their stardom, legacy, and artistic integrity. The band's leader RM in a press release described the song as, \"the joy and pain of creating something\u201d and \u201can honest track\".\n\n\n== Parallels with Christianity ==\n\nNumerous scholars have compared narratives surrounding the Christian figure of Jesus with those associated with Dionysus.\n\n\n=== Death and resurrection ===\nSome scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-rising god mythological archetype. On the other hand, it has been noted that the details of Dionysus' death and rebirth are starkly different both in content and symbolism from Jesus. The two stories take place in very different historical and geographic contexts. Also, the manner of death is different; in the most common myth, Dionysus was torn to pieces and eaten by the titans, but \"eventually restored to a new life\" from the heart that was left over.\n\n\n=== Trial ===\nAnother parallel can be seen in The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate. However, a number of scholars dispute this parallel, since the confrontation between Dionysus and Pentheus ends with Pentheus dying, torn into pieces by the mad women, whereas the trial of Jesus ends with him being sentenced to death. The discrepancies between the two stories, including their resolutions, have led many scholars to regard the Dionysus story as radically different from the one about Jesus, except for the parallel of the arrest, which is a detail that appears in many biographies as well.\n\n\n=== Sacred food and drink ===\nOther elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.\n\n\n=== Other parallels ===\nE. Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict monotheism by the fouth century AD; together with Mithraism and other sects, the cult formed an instance of \"pagan monotheism\" in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late Antiquity. Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards, especially Gerard Vossius, also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus/Bacchus and Moses (Vossius named his sons Dionysius and Isaac). Such comparisons surface in details of paintings by Poussin.Tacitus, John the Lydian, and Cornelius Labeo all identify Yahweh with the Greek god Dionysus. Jews themselves frequently used symbols that were also associated with Dionysus such as kylixes, amphorae, leaves of ivy, and clusters of grapes. In his Quaestiones Convivales, the Greek writer Plutarch of Chaeronea writes that the Jews hail their god with cries of \"Euoi\" and \"Sabi\", phrases associated with the worship of Dionysus. According to Sean M. McDonough, Greek-speakers may have confused Aramaic words such as Sabbath, Alleluia, or even possibly some variant of the name Yahweh itself for more familiar terms associated with Dionysus.John Moles has argued that the Dionysian cult influenced early Christianity, and especially the way that Christians understood themselves as a \"new\" religion centered around a savior deity. In particular, he argues that the account of Christian origins in the Acts of the Apostles was heavily influenced by Euripides' The Bacchae. Moles also suggests that Paul the Apostle may have partially based his account of the Lord's Supper[1 Cor 11:23\u201326] on the ritual meals performed by members of the Dionysian cult.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAlpos and Nonnus\nApollonian and Dionysian\nAnthesteria, Ascolia, Dionysia and Lenaia\nBacchanalia and Liberalia\nDionysian Mysteries and Cult of Dionysus,\nMaenad, Thiasus, Thyrsus and Satyr\nPan (god), Ampelos, Cybele and Silenus\nLiber\nTheatre of Dionysus\nOrgia\nOrphism\nTheatre of Dionysus\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLivy, History of Rome, Book 39:13, Description of banned Bacchanalia in Rome and Italy\nDetienne, Marcel, Dionysos at Large, tr. by Arthur Goldhammer, Harvard University Press, 1989.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

The park features some fossil replicas and several animatronic dinosaur models. Dinosaur models are displayed along an approximately 500 metres (1,600 ft) long walk, each accompanied by an information board.\nThe Dinosauria Park started as an idea in 2013 and was first housed in Gournes \u0394ekk, located in the former American base. It displayed 30 different dinosaur species from all periods of the Mesozoic era and other prehistoric animals.\nIn 2014 the exhibits were transferred to their own space, in which they were displayed in what would have been their natural environment. New species of dinosaurs were added, along with new sections, such as a \"dinosaur hospital\", depicting the hatching of a dinosaur egg. A \"5D\" cinema screen shows films to visitors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dinosaur parks\nCretaquarium\n\n\n== External links ==\nDinosauria Park",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Phaistos (Greek: \u03a6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, pronounced [fe\u02c8stos]; Ancient Greek: \u03a6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, pronounced [p\u02b0ai\u032fst\u00f3s], Minoan: PA-I-TO?), also transliterated as Phaestos, Festos and Latin Phaestus, is a Bronze Age archaeological site at modern Faistos, a municipality in south central Crete. Ancient Phaistos was located about 5.6 km (3.5 mi) east of the Mediterranean Sea and 62 km (39 mi) south of Heraklio, the second largest city of Minoan Crete. The name Phaistos survives from ancient Greek references to a city in Crete of that name at or near the current ruins.\nThe name is substantiated by the coins of the classical city. They display motifs such as Europa sitting on a bull, Talos with wings, Heracles without beard and being crowned, and Zeus in the form of a naked youth sitting on a tree. On either the obverse or the reverse the name of the city, or its abbreviation, is inscribed, such as \u03a6\u0391\u0399\u03a3 or \u03a6\u0391\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0399, for Phaistos or Phaistios (\"Phaistian\" adjective) written either right-to-left or left-to-right. These few dozen coins were acquired by collectors from uncontrolled contexts. They give no information on the location of Phaistos.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nPhaistos was located by Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, commander of the Spitfire, a paddle steamer, in the Mediterranean Survey of 1853, which described the topography, settlements and monuments of Crete. Spratt followed the directions of Strabo, who said:Of the three cities that were united under one metropolis by Minos, the third, which was Phaestus, was razed to the ground by the Gortynians; it is sixty stadia distant from Gortyn, twenty from the sea, and forty from the seaport Matalum; and the country is held by those who razed it.\nThe simple geometric problem posed by these distances from known points was solved with no difficulty by the survey. The location pinpointed was the eastern end of a hill, or ridge, rising from the middle of the Geropotamos river valley extending from the sea to the Messara Plain in an east\u2013west direction. The hill was called Kastri (\"fort\", \"small castle\"). A military man, Spratt understood the significance of the location immediately:I thus found that Phaestus had occupied the extremity of a ridge that divides the maritime plain of Debaki from the plain of the Messara, so as to command the narrow valley of communication.\nA village of 16 houses remained on the ridge, but the vestiges of fortification walls indicated a city had once existed there. A half-century later, after removing the houses, Federico Halbherr and his crew began to discover the remains of an extensive palace complex. As he had begun excavation before Arthur Evans at Knossos in 1900, he did not have the advantage of Evans' concepts of Minoan civilization nor the knowledge acquired after the decipherment of the Linear B syllabary by Michael Ventris. Excavation ended in 1904, to begin again after another half-century, in 1950. By this time it was understood that the palace had been constructed at the beginning of the Proto-Palace Period. After 1955 the place name, \ud800\udc1e\ud800\udc02\ud800\udc35, pa-i-to, interpreted as Phaistos (written in Mycenaean Greek), began to turn up in the Linear B tablets at Knossos, then under the Mycenaean Greeks. There was every reason to think that pa-i-to was located at Kastri.\nNo Linear B has been found at Phaistos, but tradition and the Knossos tablets suggest that Phaistos was a dependency of Knossos. Moreover, only a few pieces of Linear A have been found. As Phaistos appears to have been an administrative center, the lack of records is surprising.\nIn 1908, Pernier found the Phaistos Disc in the basements of the northern group of the palace. This artifact is a clay disk, dated to between 1950 BC and 1400 BC and impressed with a unique, sophisticated hieroglyphic script.\nThe tombs of the rulers of Phaistos were found in a cemetery 20 minutes away from the palace remains.\n\n\n== Bronze Age ==\nPhaistos was inhabited from about 4000 BC. A palace, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, was destroyed by an earthquake during the Late Bronze Age. Knossos along with other Minoan sites was destroyed at that time. The palace was rebuilt toward the end of the Late Bronze Age.\nThe first palace was built about 2000 BC. This section is on a lower level than the west courtyard and has a nice facade with a plastic outer shape, a cobbled courtyard, and a tower ledge with a ramp, which leads up to a higher level. The old palace was destroyed three times in period of about three centuries. After the first and second disaster, reconstruction and repairs were made, so there are distinguished three construction phases.\nThe Old Palace was built in the Protopalatial Period, then rebuilt twice due to extensive earthquake damage. When the palace was destroyed by earthquakes, the re-builders constructed a New Palace atop the old.\nSeveral artifacts with Linear A inscriptions were excavated at this site. The name of the site also appears in partially deciphered Linear A texts, and is probably similar to Mycenaean 'PA-I-TO' as written in Linear B. Several kouloura structures (subsurface pits) have been found at Phaistos. Pottery has been recovered at Phaistos from in the Middle and Late Minoan periods, including polychrome items and embossing in imitation of metal work. Bronze Age works from Phaistos include bridge spouted bowls, eggshell cups, tall jars and large pithoi.In one of the three hills of the area, remains of the middle neolithic age have been found, and a part of the palace was built during the Early Minoan period. Another two palaces seems to have been built at the Middle and Late Minoan Age. The older looks like the Minoan palace of Knossos, although this is smaller. An earthquake c. 18th century BC destroyed the palace but a larger palace of the later Minoan period was built on the ruins around 1700 BC, consisting of several rooms separated by columns.\nThe levels of the theater area, in conjunction with two splendid staircases, gave a grand access to the main hall of the propylaea through high doors. A twin gate led directly to the central courtyard through a wide street. The floors and walls of the interior rooms were decorated with plates of sand and white gypsum stone. Upper floors of the west sector had spacious ceremonial rooms, although their exact restoration was not possible.\nA brilliant entrance from the central courtyard led to the royal apartments in the north part of the palace, with a view of the tops of Psiloritis. The rooms were constructed from alabaster and other materials. The rooms for princes were smaller and less luxurious than the rooms of the royal departments.\nAround 1400 BC, the invading Achaeans destroyed Phaistos, as well as Knossos. The palace appears to have been unused thereafter, as evidence of the Mycenaean era have not been found.\n\n\n== Iron Age ==\nReferences to Phaistos in ancient Greek literature are quite frequent. Phaistos is first referenced by Homer as \"well populated\", and the Homeric epics indicate its participation in the Trojan War. The historian Diodorus Siculus indicates that Phaistos, together with Knossos and Kydonia, are the three towns that were founded by King Minos on Crete. Instead, Pausanias and Stephanus of Byzantium supported in their texts that the founder of the city was Phaestos, son of Hercules or Ropalus. The city of Phaistos is associated with the mythical king of Crete Rhadamanthys.\nThe site was reinhabited during the Geometric Age (8th century BC). Phaistos had its own currency and had created an alliance with other autonomous Cretan cities, and with the king of Pergamon Eumenes II. Around the end of the 3rd century BC, Phaestos was destroyed by the Gortynians and since then ceased to exist in the history of Crete. Scotia Aphrodite and goddess Leto, who was also called Phytia, were worshiped there. The people of Phaistos were distinguished for their funny adages. Epimenides, the wise man invited by the Athenians to clean the city after the Cylonian affair (Cyloneio agos) in the 6th century BC, was of Phaistian descent.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmari\nKalyvia\nKamares, Crete\nMonastiraki, Crete\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAdams, E.

        "wiki": "Nikos Kazantzakis (Greek: \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 [\u02c8nikos kazan\u02c8d\u0361zacis]; 18 February 1883 \u2013 26 October 1957) was a Greek writer. Widely considered a giant of modern Greek literature, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in nine different years.Kazantzakis' novels included Zorba the Greek (published 1946 as Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas), Christ Recrucified (1948), Captain Michalis (1950, translated Freedom or Death), and The Last Temptation of Christ (1955).  He also wrote plays, travel books, memoirs and philosophical essays such as The Saviors of God: Spiritual Exercises. His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of Zorba the Greek (1964) and The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).\nHe translated also a number of notable works into Modern Greek, such as the Divine Comedy, Thus Spoke Zarathustra and the Iliad.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWhen Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in Kandiye, now Heraklion, Crete had not yet joined the modern Greek state (which had been established in 1832), and was still under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. From 1902 to 1906 Kazantzakis studied law at the University of Athens: his 1906 Juris Doctor thesis title was \u039f \u03a6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Law and the State\"). Then he went to the Sorbonne in 1907 to study philosophy. There he fell under the influence of Henri Bergson. His 1909 doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne was a reworked version of his 1906 dissertation under the title Friedrich Nietzsche dans la philosophie du droit et de la cit\u00e9 (\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right and the State\").  Upon his return to Greece, he began translating works of philosophy. In 1914 he met Angelos Sikelianos. Together they travelled for two years in places where Greek Orthodox Christian culture flourished, largely influenced by the enthusiastic nationalism of Sikelianos.\nKazantzakis married Galatea Alexiou in 1911; they divorced in 1926. He married Eleni Samiou in 1945. Between 1922 and his death in 1957, he sojourned in Paris and Berlin (from 1922 to 1924), Italy, Russia (in 1925), Spain (in 1932), and then later in Cyprus, Aegina, Egypt, Mount Sinai, Czechoslovakia, Nice (he later bought a villa in nearby Antibes, in the Old Town section near the famed seawall), China, and Japan.\nWhile in Berlin, where the political situation was explosive, Kazantzakis discovered communism and became an admirer of Vladimir Lenin. He never became a committed communist, but visited the Soviet Union and stayed with the Left Opposition politician and writer Victor Serge. He witnessed the rise of Joseph Stalin, and became disillusioned with Soviet-style communism. Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology.\nAs a journalist in 1926 he got interviews from Miguel Primo de Rivera and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.\nThe 50th anniversary of the death of Nikos Kazantzakis was selected as main motif for a high-value euro collectors' coin; the \u20ac10 Greek Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin, minted in 2007. His image is on the obverse of the coin, while the reverse carries the National Emblem of Greece with his signature.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nDuring WWII he was in Athens and translated the Iliad, together with the philologist Ioannis Kakridis. In 1945, he became the leader of a small party on the non-communist left, and entered the Greek government as Minister without Portfolio. He resigned this post the following year. In 1946, The Society of Greek Writers recommended that Kazantzakis and Angelos Sikelianos be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1957, he lost the Prize to Albert Camus by one vote. Camus later said that Kazantzakis deserved the honour \"a hundred times more\" than himself. In total Kazantzakis was nominated in nine different years. Late in 1957, even though suffering from leukemia, he set out on one last trip to China and Japan. Falling ill on his return flight, he was transferred to Freiburg, Germany, where he died. He is buried on the wall surrounding the city of Heraklion near the Chania Gate, looking out over the mountains and sea of Crete. His epitaph reads \"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\" (\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1. \u0394\u03b5 \u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1. \u0395\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2.)\n\n\n== Literary work ==\nKazantzakis' first published work was the 1906 narrative, Serpent and Lily (\u038c\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf), which he signed with the pen name Karma Nirvami. In 1907 Kazantzakis went to Paris for his graduate studies and was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Henry Bergson, primarily the idea that a true understanding of the world comes from the combination of intuition, personal experience, and rational thought. The theme of rationalism mixed with irrationality later became central to many of Kazantzakis' later stories, characters, and personal philosophies. Later, in 1909, he wrote a one-act play titled Comedy, which was filled with existential themes, predating the post-World War II existentialist movement in Europe spearheaded by writers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus. After completing his studies in Paris, he wrote the tragedy, \"The Master Builder\" (\u039f \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2), based on a popular Greek folkloric myth.\n\nThrough the next several decades, from the 1910s through the 1930s, Kazantzakis traveled around Greece, much of Europe, northern Africa, and to several countries in Asia. Countries he visited include: Germany, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Romania, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, among others. These journeys put Kazantzakis in contact with different philosophies, ideologies, lifestyles, and people, all of which influenced him and his writings. Kazantzakis would often write about his influences in letters to friends, citing Sigmund Freud, the philosophy of Nietzsche, Buddhist theology, and communist ideology and major influences. While he continued to travel later in life, the bulk of his travel writing came from this time period.\nKazantzakis began writing The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel in 1924, and completed it in 1938 after fourteen years of writing and revision. The poem follows the hero of Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus, as he undertakes a final journey after the end of the original poem. Following the structure of Homer's Odyssey, it is divided into 24 rhapsodies and consists of 33,333 lines. While Kazantzakis felt this poem held his cumulative wisdom and experience, and that it was his greatest literary experience, critics were split, \"some praised it as an unprecedented epic, [while] many simply viewed it as a hybristic act,\" with many scholars still being split to this day. A common criticism of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel was aimed at Kazantzakis' over-reliance on flowery and metaphorical verse, a criticism that is also aimed at his works of fiction.Many of Kazantzakis' most famous novels were published between 1940 and 1961, including Zorba the Greek (1946), Christ Recrucified (1948), Captain Michalis (1953), The Last Temptation of Christ (1955), and Report to Greco (1961).\nScholar Peter Bein argues that each story explores different aspects of post-World War II Greek culture such as religion, nationalism, political beliefs, the Greek Civil War, gender roles, immigration, and general cultural practices and beliefs. These works also explore what Kazantzakis believed to be the unique physical and spiritual location of Greece, a nation that belongs to neither the East nor the West, an idea he put forth in many of his letters to friends. As the scholar Peter Bein argued, \"Kazantzakis viewed Greece's special mission as the reconciliation of Eastern instinct with Western reason,\" echoing the Bergsonian themes that balance logic against emotion found in many of Kazantzakis' novels.\nTwo of these works of fiction, Zorba the Greek and The Last Temptation of Christ had major motion picture adaptations in 1964 and 1988 respectively.\n\n\n== Language and use of Demotic Greek ==\nDuring the time when Kazantzakis was writing his novels, poems, and plays, the majority of \"serious\" Greek artistic work was written in Katharevousa, a \"pure\" form of the Greek language that was created to bridge Ancient Greek with Modern, Demotic Greek, and to \"purify\" Demotic Greek. The use of Demotic, among writers, gradually started to gain the upper hand only in the turn of the 20th century, under the influence of the New Athenian School (or Palamian).\nIn his letters to friends and correspondents, Kazantzakis wrote that he chose to write in Demotic Greek to capture the spirit of the people, and to make his writing resonate with the common Greek citizen. Moreover, he wanted to prove that the common spoken language of Greek was able to produce artistic, literary works. Or, in his own words, \"Why not show off all the possibilities of demotic Greek?\" Furthermore, Kazantzakis felt that it was important to record the vernacular of the everyday person, including Greek peasants, and often tried to include expressions, metaphors, and idioms he would hear while traveling throughout Greece, and incorporate them into his writing for posterity. At the time of writing, some scholars and critics panned his work because it was not written in Katharevousa, while others praised it precisely because it was written in Demotic Greek.\nSeveral critics have argued that Kazantzakis' writing was too flowery, filled with obscure metaphors, and difficult to read, despite the fact that his works were written in Demotic Greek. Kazantzakis scholar Peter Bein argues that the metaphors and language Kazantzakis used were taken directly from the peasants he encountered when traveling Greece. Bein asserts that, since Kazantzakis was trying to preserve the language of the people, he used their local metaphors and phrases to give his narrative an air of authenticity and preserve these phrases so that they were not lost.\n\n\n== Socialism ==\nThroughout his life, Kazantzakis reiterated his belief that \"only socialism as the goal and democracy as the means\" could provide an equitable solution to the \"frightfully urgent problems of the age in which we are living.\" He saw the need for socialist parties throughout the world to put aside their bickering and unite so that the program of \"socialist democracy\" could prevail not just in Greece, but throughout the civilized world. He described socialism as a social system which \"does not permit the exploitation of one person by another\" and that \"must guarantee every freedom.\"Kazantzakis was anathema to the right-wing in Greece both before and after World War II. The right waged war against his books and called him \"immoral\" and a \"Bolshevik troublemaker\" and accused him of being a \"Russian agent\". He was also distrusted by the Greek and Russian Communist parties as a \"bourgeois\" thinker. However, upon his death in 1957, he was honored by the Chinese Communist party as a \"great writer\" and \"devotee of peace.\" Following the war, he was temporarily leader of a minor Greek leftist party, while in 1945 he was, among others, a founding member of the Greek-Soviet friendship union.\n\n\n== Religious beliefs and relationship with the Greek Orthodox Church ==\nWhile Kazantzakis was deeply spiritual, he often discussed his struggle with religious faith, specifically his Greek Orthodoxy. Baptized Greek Orthodox as a child, he was fascinated by the lives of saints from a young age. As a young man he took a month long trip to Mount Athos, a major spiritual center for Greek Orthodoxy. Most critics and scholars of Kazantzakis agree that the struggle to find truth in religion and spirituality was central to a great deal of his works, and that some novels, like The Last Temptation of Christ and Christ Recrucified focus completely on questioning Christian morals and values. As he traveled Europe, he was influenced by various philosophers, cultures, and religions, like Buddhism, causing him to question his Christian beliefs. While never claiming to be an atheist, his public questioning and critique of the most fundamental Christian values put him at odds with some in the Greek Orthodox church, and many of his critics. Scholars theorize that Kazantzakis' difficult relationship with many members of the clergy, and the more religiously conservative literary critics, came from his questioning. In his book, Broken Hallelujah: Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian Theology, author Darren Middleton theorizes that, \"Where the majority of Christian writers focus on God's immutability, Jesus' deity, and our salvation through God's grace, Kazantzakis emphasized divine mutability, Jesus' humanity, and God's own redemption through our effort,\" highlighting Kazantzakis' uncommon interpretation of traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs. Many Orthodox Church clergy condemned Kazantzakis' work and a campaign was started to excommunicate him. His reply was: \"You gave me a curse, Holy fathers, I give you a blessing: may your conscience be as clear as mine and may you be as moral and religious as I\" (Greek: \"\u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1, \u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ce \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae: \u03a3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u2018\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03ae, \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u2018\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b7\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ce\"). While the excommunication was rejected by the top leadership of the Orthodox Church, it became emblematic of the persistent disapprobation from many Christian authorities for his political and religious views.\nModern scholarship tends to dismiss the idea that Kazantzakis was being sacrilegious or blasphemous with the content of his novels and beliefs. These scholars argue that, if anything, Kazantzakis was acting in accordance to a long tradition of Christians who publicly struggled with their faith, and grew a stronger and more personal connection to God through their doubt. Moreover, scholars like Darren J. N. Middleton argue that Kazantzakis' interpretation of the Christian faith predated the more modern, personalized interpretation of Christianity that has become popular in the years after Kazantzakis' death.The Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras, the leader of the Orthodox Church, declared in 1961 in Heraklion: \u201cKazantzakis is a great man and his works grace the Patriarchal library.\u201d\n\n\n== Bibliography of English translations ==\n\n\n=== Translations of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, in whole or in part ===\nThe Odyssey [Selections from], partial translation in prose by Kimon Friar, Wake 12 (1953), pp. 58\u201365.\nThe Odyssey, excerpt translated by Kimon Friar, Chicago Review 8, No. 2 (Spring/Summer 1954), pp. 12\u201318.\n\"The Return of Odysseus\", partial translation by Kimon Friar, The Atlantic Monthly 195, No. 6 (June 1955), pp. 110\u2013112.\nThe Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, a full verse-translation by Kimon Friar, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1958; London: Secker and Warburg, 1958.\n\"Death, the Ant\", from The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, Book XV, 829\u201363, translated by Kimon Friar, The Charioteer, No. 1 (Summer 1960), p. 39.\n\n\n=== Travel books ===\nSpain, translated by Amy Mims, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1963.\nJapan, China, translated by George C.

        "wiki": "The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age Aegean civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, flourishing from c. 3000 BC to c. 1450 BC until a late period of decline, finally ending around 1100 BC. It represents the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive building complexes, tools, artwork, writing systems, and a massive network of trade. The civilization was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century through the work of British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. The name \"Minoan\" derives from the mythical King Minos and was coined by Evans, who identified the site at Knossos with the labyrinth and the Minotaur. The Minoan civilization has been described as the earliest of its kind in Europe, and historian Will Durant called the Minoans \"the first link in the European chain\".The Minoan civilization is particularly notable for its large and elaborate palaces up to four stories high, featuring elaborate plumbing systems and decorated with frescoes. The most notable Minoan palace is that of Knossos, followed by that of Phaistos. The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete, Aegean, and Mediterranean settlements, particularly the Near East. Through their traders and artists, the Minoans' cultural influence reached beyond Crete to the Cyclades, the Old Kingdom of Egypt, copper-bearing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia. Some of the best Minoan art is preserved in the city of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini, which was destroyed by the Minoan eruption.\nThe Minoans primarily wrote in the  Linear A and also in  Cretan hieroglyphs, encoding a language hypothetically labelled Minoan. The reasons for the slow decline of the Minoan civilization, beginning around 1550 BC, are unclear; theories include Mycenaean  invasions from mainland Greece and the major volcanic eruption of Santorini.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe term \"Minoan\" refers to the mythical King Minos of Knossos. Its origin is debated, but it is commonly attributed to archeologist Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941). Minos was associated in Greek mythology with the labyrinth.\nHowever, Karl Hoeck had already used the title Das Minoische Kreta in 1825 for volume two of his Kreta; this appears to be the first known use of the word \"Minoan\" to mean \"ancient Cretan\".\nEvans probably read Hoeck's book, and continued using the term in his writings and findings: \"To this early civilization of Crete as a whole I have proposed\u2014and the suggestion has been generally adopted by the archaeologists of this and other countries\u2014to apply the name 'Minoan'.\" Evans said that he applied it, not invented it.\nHoeck, with no idea that the archaeological Crete had existed, had in mind the Crete of mythology. Although Evans' 1931 claim that the term was \"unminted\" before he used it was called a \"brazen suggestion\" by Karadimas and Momigliano, he coined its archaeological meaning.\n\n\n== Chronology and history ==\n\nInstead of dating the Minoan period, archaeologists use two systems of relative chronology. The first, created by Evans and modified by later archaeologists, is based on pottery styles and imported Egyptian artifacts (which can be correlated with the Egyptian chronology). Evans' system divides the Minoan period into three major eras: early (EM), middle (MM) and late (LM). These eras are subdivided\u2014for example, Early Minoan I, II and III (EMI, EMII, EMIII).\nAnother dating system, proposed by Greek archaeologist Nikolaos Platon, is based on the development of architectural complexes known as \"palaces\" at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia and Zakros. Platon divides the Minoan period into pre-, proto-, neo- and post-palatial sub-periods. The relationship between the systems in the table includes approximate calendar dates from Warren and Hankey (1989).\nThe Minoan eruption of Thera occurred during a mature phase of the LM IA period. Efforts to establish the volcanic eruption's date have been controversial. Radiocarbon dating has indicated a date in the late 17th century BC; this conflicts with estimates by archaeologists, who synchronize the eruption with conventional Egyptian chronology for a date of 1525\u20131500 BC. Tree-ring dating using the patterns of carbon-14 captured in the tree rings from Gordion and bristlecone pines in North America indicate an eruption date around 1560 BC.\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nAlthough stone-tool evidence suggests that hominins may have reached Crete as early as 130,000 years ago, evidence for the first anatomically-modern human presence dates to 10,000\u201312,000 YBP. The oldest evidence of modern human habitation on Crete is pre-ceramic Neolithic farming-community remains which date to about 7000 BC. A comparative study of DNA haplogroups of modern Cretan men showed that a male founder group, from Anatolia or the Levant, is shared with the Greeks. The Neolithic population lived in open villages. Fishermen's huts were found on the shores, and the fertile Messara Plain was used for agriculture.\n\n\n==== Early Minoan ====\nThe Early Bronze Age (3500 to 2100 BC) has been described as indicating a \"promise of greatness\" in light of later developments on the island. The Bronze Age began on Crete around 3200 BC. In the late third millennium BC, several locations on the island developed into centers of commerce and handiwork, enabling the upper classes to exercise leadership and expand their influence. It is likely that the original hierarchies of the local elites were replaced by monarchies, a precondition for the palaces.\n\n\n==== Middle Minoan ====\nAt the end of the MMII period (1700 BC) there was a large disturbance on Crete\u2014probably an earthquake, but possibly an invasion from Anatolia. The palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia and Kato Zakros were destroyed.\nAt the beginning of the neopalatial period the population increased again, the palaces were rebuilt on a larger scale and new settlements were built across the island. This period (the 17th and 16th centuries BC, MM III-Neopalatial) was the apex of Minoan civilization. After around 1700 BC, material culture on the Greek mainland reached a new high due to Minoan influence.\n\n\n==== Late Minoan ====\nAnother natural catastrophe occurred around 1600 BC, possibly an eruption of the Thera volcano. The Minoans rebuilt the palaces with several major differences in function.Around 1450 BC, Minoan culture reached a turning point due to a natural disaster (possibly an earthquake). Although another eruption of the Thera volcano has been linked to this downfall, its dating and implications are disputed. Several important palaces, in locations such as Malia, Tylissos, Phaistos and Hagia Triada, and the living quarters of Knossos were destroyed. The palace in Knossos seems to have remained largely intact, resulting in its dynasty's ability to spread its influence over large parts of Crete until it was overrun by the Mycenaean Greeks.After about a century of partial recovery, most Cretan cities and palaces declined during the 13th century BC (LHIIIB-LMIIIB). The last Linear A archives date to LMIIIA, contemporary with LHIIIA. Knossos remained an administrative center until 1200 BC. The last Minoan site was the defensive mountain site of Karfi, a refuge which had vestiges of Minoan civilization nearly into the Iron Age.\n\n\n==== Foreign influence ====\nThe influence of Minoan civilization is seen in Minoan handicrafts on the Greek mainland. The shaft tombs of Mycenae had several Cretan imports (such as a bull's-head rhyton), which suggests a prominent role for Minoan symbolism. Connections between Egypt and Crete are prominent; Minoan ceramics are found in Egyptian cities, and the Minoans imported items (particularly papyrus) and architectural and artistic ideas from Egypt. Egyptian hieroglyphs might even have been models for the Cretan hieroglyphs, from which the Linear A and Linear B writing systems developed. Archaeologist Hermann Bengtson has also found a Minoan influence in Canaanite artifacts.\nMinoan palace sites were occupied by the Mycenaeans around 1420\u20131375 BC. Mycenaean Greek, a form of ancient Greek, was written in Linear B, which was an adaptation of Linear A. The Mycenaeans tended to adapt (rather than supplant) Minoan culture, religion and art, continuing the Minoan economic system and bureaucracy.During LMIIIA (1400\u20131350 BC), k-f-t-w was listed as one of the \"Secret Lands of the North of Asia\" at the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III. Also mentioned are Cretan cities such as Amnisos, Phaistos, Kydonia and Knossos and toponyms reconstructed as in the Cyclades or the Greek mainland. If the values of these Egyptian names are accurate, the Pharaoh did not value LMIII Knossos more than other states in the region.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCrete is a mountainous island with natural harbors. There are signs of earthquake damage at many Minoan sites, and clear signs of land uplifting and submersion of coastal sites due to tectonic processes along its coast.According to Homer, Crete had 90 cities. Judging by the palace sites, the island was probably divided into at least eight political units at the height of the Minoan period. The vast majority of Minoan sites are found in central and eastern Crete, with few in the western part of the island. There appears to be four major palaces on the island: Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros. The north is thought to have been governed from Knossos, the south from Phaistos, the central-eastern region from Malia, the eastern tip from Kato Zakros. Smaller palaces have been found elsewhere on the island.\n\n\n=== Major settlements ===\nKnossos \u2013 the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete. Knossos had an estimated population of 1,300 to 2,000 in 2500 BC, 18,000 in 2000 BC, 20,000 to 100,000 in 1600 BC and 30,000 in 1360 BC.\nPhaistos \u2013 the second-largest palatial building on the island, excavated by the Italian school shortly after Knossos\nMalia \u2013 the subject of French excavations, a palatial center which provides a look into the proto-palatial period\nKato Zakros \u2013 sea-side palatial site excavated by Greek archaeologists in the far east of the island, also known as \"Zakro\" in archaeological literature\nGalatas \u2013 confirmed as a palatial site during the early 1990s\nAgia Triada \u2013 administrative center near Phaistos which has yielded the largest number of Linear A tablets.\nGournia \u2013 town site excavated in the first quarter of the 20th century\nPyrgos \u2013 early Minoan site in southern Crete\nVasiliki \u2013 early eastern Minoan site which gives its name to distinctive ceramic ware\nFournou Korfi \u2013 southern site\nPseira \u2013 island town with ritual sites\nMount Juktas \u2013 the greatest Minoan peak sanctuary, associated with the palace of Knossos\nArkalochori \u2013 site of the Arkalochori Axe\nKarfi \u2013 refuge site, one of the last Minoan sites\nAkrotiri \u2013 settlement on the island of Santorini (Thera), near the site of the Thera Eruption\nZominthos \u2013 mountainous city in the northern foothills of Mount Ida\n\n\n=== Beyond Crete ===\n\nThe Minoans were traders, and their cultural contacts reached the Old Kingdom of Egypt, copper-containing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia. In late 2009 Minoan-style frescoes and other artifacts were discovered during excavations of the Canaanite palace at Tel Kabri, Israel, leading archaeologists to conclude that the Minoan influence was the strongest on the Canaanite city-state. These are the only Minoan artifacts which have been found in Israel.Minoan techniques and ceramic styles had varying degrees of influence on Helladic Greece. Along with Santorini, Minoan settlements are found at Kastri, Kythera, an island near the Greek mainland influenced by the Minoans from the mid-third millennium BC (EMII) to its Mycenaean occupation in the 13th century. Minoan strata replaced a mainland-derived early Bronze Age culture, the earliest Minoan settlement outside Crete.The Cyclades were in the Minoan cultural orbit and, closer to Crete, the islands of Karpathos, Saria and Kasos also contained middle-Bronze Age (MMI-II) Minoan colonies or settlements of Minoan traders. Most were abandoned in LMI, but Karpathos recovered and continued its Minoan culture until the end of the Bronze Age. Other supposed Minoan colonies, such as that hypothesized by Adolf Furtw\u00e4ngler on Aegina, were later dismissed by scholars. However, there was a Minoan colony at Ialysos on Rhodes.\n\nMinoan cultural influence indicates an orbit extending through the Cyclades to Egypt and Cyprus. Fifteenth-century BC paintings in Thebes, Egypt depict Minoan-appearing individuals bearing gifts. Inscriptions describing them as coming from keftiu (\"islands in the middle of the sea\") may refer to gift-bringing merchants or officials from Crete.Some locations on Crete indicate that the Minoans were an \"outward-looking\" society. The neo-palatial site of Kato Zakros is located within 100 meters of the modern shoreline in a bay. Its large number of workshops and wealth of site materials indicate a possible entrep\u00f4t for trade. Such activities are seen in artistic representations of the sea, including the \"Flotilla\" fresco in room five of the West House at Akrotiri.\n\n\n== Agriculture and cuisine ==\n\nThe Minoans raised cattle, sheep, pigs and goats, and grew wheat, barley, vetch and chickpeas. They also cultivated grapes, figs and olives, grew poppies for seed and perhaps opium. The Minoans also domesticated bees.Vegetables, including lettuce, celery, asparagus and carrots, grew wild on Crete. Pear, quince, and olive trees were also native. Date palm trees and cats (for hunting) were imported from Egypt. The Minoans adopted pomegranates from the Near East, but not lemons and oranges.\nThey may have practiced polyculture, and their varied, healthy diet resulted in a population increase. Polyculture theoretically maintains soil fertility and protects against losses due to crop failure. Linear B tablets indicate the importance of orchards (figs, olives and grapes) in processing crops for \"secondary products\". Olive oil in Cretan or Mediterranean cuisine is comparable to butter in northern European cuisine. The process of fermenting wine from grapes was probably a factor of the \"Palace\" economies; wine would have been a trade commodity and an item of domestic consumption. Farmers used wooden plows, bound with leather to wooden handles and pulled by pairs of donkeys or oxen.\nSeafood was also important in Cretan cuisine. The prevalence of edible molluscs in site material and artistic representations of marine fish and animals (including the distinctive LM IIIC \"Octopus\" stirrup jar), indicate appreciation and occasional use of fish by the economy. However, scholars believe that these resources were not as significant as grain, olives and animal produce. \"Fishing was one of the major activities...but there is as yet no evidence for the way in which they organized their fishing.\" An intensification of agricultural activity is indicated by the construction of terraces and dams at Pseira in the Late Minoan period.\nCretan cuisine included wild game: Cretans ate wild deer, wild boar and meat from livestock. Wild game is now extinct on Crete. A matter of controversy is whereas Minoans made use of the indigenous Cretan megafauna, which are typically thought to have been extinct considerably earlier at 10,000 BC. This is in part due to the presence of dwarf elephants in contemporary Egyptian art.Not all plants and flora were purely functional, and arts depict scenes of lily-gathering in green spaces. The fresco known as the Sacred Grove at Knossos depicts women facing left, flanked by trees. Some scholars have suggested that it is a harvest festival or ceremony to honor the fertility of the soil. Artistic depictions of farming scenes also appear on the Second Palace Period \"Harvester Vase\" (an egg-shaped rhyton) on which 27 men led by another carry hoes. This demonstrates the importance of farming as an artistic motif.\nThe discovery of storage areas in the palace compounds has prompted debate. At the second \"palace\" at Phaistos, rooms on the west side of the structure have been identified as a storage area. Jars, jugs and vessels have been recovered in the area, indicating the complex's possible role as a re-distribution center for agricultural produce. At larger sites such as Knossos, there is evidence of craft specialization (workshops). The palace at Kato Zakro indicates that workshops were integrated into palace structure. The Minoan palatial system may have developed through economic intensification, where an agricultural surplus could support a population of administrators, craftsmen and religious practitioners. The number of sleeping rooms in the palaces indicates that they could have supported a sizable population which was removed from manual labor.\n\n\n=== Tools ===\nTools, originally made of wood or bone, were bound to handles with leather straps. During the Bronze Age, they were made of bronze with wooden handles. Due to its round hole, the tool head would spin on the handle. The Minoans developed oval-shaped holes in their tools to fit oval-shaped handles, which prevented spinning. Tools included double adzes, double- and single-bladed axes, axe-adzes, sickles and chisels.\n\n\n== Minoan women ==\nAs Linear A, Minoan writing, has not been decoded yet, almost all information available about Minoan women is from various art forms. Most importantly, women are depicted in fresco art paintings within various aspects of society such as child rearing, ritual participation, and worshiping.\n\nArtistically, women were portrayed very differently compared to the representations of men. Most obviously, men were often artistically represented with dark skin while women were represented with lighter skin. Fresco paintings also portray three class levels of women; elite women, women of the masses, and servants. A fourth, smaller class of women are also included among some paintings; these women are those who participated in religious and sacred tasks. Evidence for these different classes of women not only comes from fresco paintings but from Linear B tablets as well. Elite women were depicted within paintings as having a stature twice the size of women in lower classes, artistically this was a way of emphasizing the important difference between the elite wealthy women and the rest of the female population within society.Within paintings women were also portrayed as caretakers of children, however few frescoes portray pregnant women, most artistic representations of pregnant women are in the form of sculpted pots with the rounded base of the pots representing the pregnant belly.  Additionally, no Minoan art forms portray women giving birth, breast feeding, or procreating. Lack of such actions leads historians to believe that these actions would have been recognized by Minoan society to be either sacred or inappropriate. As public art pieces such as frescoes and pots do not illustrate these acts, it can be assumed that this part of a woman's life was kept private within society as a whole.\nNot only was childbirth a private subject within Minoan society but it was a dangerous process as well. Archeological sources have found numerous bones of pregnant women, identified as pregnant by the fetus bones within their skeleton found in the abdomen area. This leads to strong evidence that death during pregnancy and childbirth were common features within society. Further archeological evidence illustrates strong evidence for female death caused by nursing as well. Death of this population is attributed to the vast amount of nutrition and fat that women lost because of lactation which they often could not get back.\nAs stated above childcare was a central job for women within Minoan society, evidence for this can not only be found within art forms but also within the Linear B found in Mycenaean communities. Some of these sources describe the child-care practices common within Minoan society which help historians to better understand Minoan society and the role of women within these communities.\nOther roles outside the household that have been identified as women's duties are food gathering, food preparation, and household care-taking. Additionally, it has been found that women were represented in the artisan world as ceramic and textile craftswomen.As women got older it can be assumed that their jobs taking care of children ended and transitions to more of a priority towards household management and job mentoring, teaching younger women the jobs that they themselves participated in.\n\nMinoan dress representation also clearly marks the difference between men and women. Minoan men were often depicted clad in little clothing while women's bodies, specifically later on, were more covered up. While there is evidence that the structure of women's clothing originated as a mirror to the clothing that men wore, fresco art illustrates how women's clothing evolved to be more and more elaborate throughout the Minoan era. Throughout the evolutions of women's clothing, a strong emphasis was placed on the women's sexual characteristics, particularly the breasts. Female clothing throughout the Minoan era emphasized the breasts by exposing cleavage or even the entire breast. Similarly to the modern bodice women continue to wear today, Minoan women were portrayed with \u201cwasp\u201d waists. This means that the waist of women were constricted, made smaller by a tall belt or a tight lace bodice. Furthermore, not only women but men are illustrated wearing these accessories.\nWithin Minoan society and throughout the Minoan era, numerous documents written in Linear B have been found documenting Minoan families. Interestingly, spouses and children are not all listed together, in one section, fathers were listed with their sons, while mothers were listed with their daughter in a completely different section apart from the men who lived in the same household. This signifies the vast gender divide that was present within all aspects of society.\nMinoan society was a highly gendered and divided society separating men from women in clothing, art illustration, and societal duties. Scholarship about Minoan women remains limited.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\nThe Minoans were primarily a mercantile people who engaged in overseas trade. After 1700 BC, their culture indicates a high degree of organization. Minoan-manufactured goods suggest a network of trade with mainland Greece (notably Mycenae), Cyprus, Syria, Anatolia, Egypt, Mesopotamia and westward as far as the Iberian peninsula.  Minoan religion apparently focused on female deities, with women officiants. While historians and archaeologists have long been skeptical of an outright matriarchy, the predominance of female figures in authoritative roles over male ones seems to indicate that Minoan society was matriarchal, and among the most well-supported examples known.\n\n\n=== Government ===\nBecause their language has yet to be deciphered, it is unknown what kind of government was practiced by the Minoans, though the palaces and throne rooms indicate a form of hierarchy.\n\n\n=== Saffron trade ===\n\nA fresco of saffron-gatherers at Santorini is well-known. The Minoan trade in saffron, the stigma of a naturally-mutated crocus which originated in the Aegean basin, has left few material remains. According to Evans, the saffron (a sizable Minoan industry) was used for dye. Other archaeologists emphasize durable trade items: ceramics, copper, tin, gold and silver. The saffron may have had a religious significance. The saffron trade, which predated Minoan civilization, was comparable in value to that of frankincense or black pepper.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nMinoan men wore loincloths and kilts. Women wore robes with short sleeves and layered, flounced skirts. The robes were open to the navel, exposing their breasts. Women could also wear a strapless, fitted bodice, and clothing patterns had symmetrical, geometric designs.\n\n\n=== Language and writing ===\n\nSeveral writing systems dating from the Minoan period have been unearthed in Crete, the majority of which are currently undeciphered.\nThe most well-known script is Linear A, dated to between 2500 BC and 1450 BC. Linear A is the parent of the related Linear B script, which encodes the earliest known form of Greek. Several attempts to translate Linear A have been made, but consensus is lacking and Linear A is currently considered undeciphered.  The language encoded by Linear A is tentatively dubbed \"Minoan\". When the values of the symbols in Linear B are used in Linear A, they produce unintelligible words, and would make Minoan unrelated to any other known language. There is a belief that the Minoans used their written language primarily as an accounting tool and that even if deciphered, may offer little insight other than detailed descriptions of quantities.\nLinear A is preceded by about a century by the Cretan hieroglyphs. It is unknown whether the language is Minoan, and its origin is debated. Although the hieroglyphs are often associated with the Egyptians, they also indicate a relationship to Mesopotamian writings. They came into use about a century before Linear A, and were used at the same time as Linear A (18th century BC; MM II). The hieroglyphs disappeared during the 17th century BC (MM III).\nThe Phaistos Disc features a unique pictorial script. Although its origin is debated, it is now widely believed to be of Cretan origin. Because it is the only find of its kind, the script on the Phaistos disc remains undeciphered.\nIn addition to the above, five inscriptions dated to the 7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Eastern Crete (and possible as late as the 3rd century BC) written in an archaic Greek alphabet that encode a clearly non-Greek language, dubbed \"Eteocretan\" (lit. \"True Cretan\"). Given the small number of inscriptions, the language remains little-known. Eteocretan inscriptions are separated from Linear A by about a millennium, and it is thus unknown if Eteocretan represents a descendant of the Minoan language.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Minoans seem to have prominently worshiped a Great Goddess, which had previously led to the belief that their society was matriarchal. However it is now known that this was not the case; the Minoan pantheon featured many deities, among which a young, spear-wielding male god is also prominent. Some scholars see in the Minoan Goddess a female divine solar figure. Although some depictions of women may be images of worshipers and priestesses officiating at religious ceremonies (as opposed to deities), goddesses seem to include a mother goddess of fertility, a goddess of animals and female protectors of cities, the household, the harvest and the underworld. They are often represented by serpents, birds, poppies or an animal on the head.\nAccording to Nanno Marinatos, \"The hierarchy and relationship of gods within the pantheon is difficult to decode from the images alone.\" Marinatos disagrees with earlier descriptions of Minoan religion as primitive, saying that it \"was the religion of a sophisticated and urbanized palatial culture with a complex social hierarchy. It was not dominated by fertility any more than any religion of the past or present has been, and it addressed gender identity, rites of passage, and death. It is reasonable to assume that both the organization and the rituals, even the mythology, resembled the religions of Near Eastern palatial civilizations.\" It even seems that the later Greek pantheon would synthesize the Minoan female deity and Hittite goddess from the Near East.\n\n\n==== Symbolism ====\nMinoan horn-topped altars, which Arthur Evans called Horns of Consecration, are represented in seal impressions and have been found as far afield as Cyprus. Minoan sacred symbols include the bull (and its horns of consecration), the labrys (double-headed axe), the pillar, the serpent, the sun-disc, the tree, and even the Ankh.\n\nHaralampos V. Harissis and Anastasios V. Harissis posit a different interpretation of these symbols, saying that they were based on apiculture rather than religion. A major festival was exemplified in bull-leaping, represented in the frescoes of Knossos and inscribed in miniature seals.\n\n\n==== Burial practices ====\nSimilar to other Bronze Age archaeological finds, burial remains constitute much of the material and archaeological evidence for the period. By the end of the Second Palace Period, Minoan burial was dominated by two forms: circular tombs (tholoi) in southern Crete and house tombs in the north and the east. However, much Minoan mortuary practice does not conform to this pattern. Burial was more popular than cremation. Individual burial was the rule, except for the Chrysolakkos complex in Malia. Here, a number of buildings form a complex in the center of Mallia's burial area and may have been the focus for burial rituals or a crypt for a notable family. Evidence of possible human sacrifice by the Minoans has been found at three sites: at Anemospilia, in a MMII building near Mt. Juktas considered a temple; an EMII sanctuary complex at Fournou Korifi in south-central Crete, and in an LMIB building known as the North House in Knossos.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMinoan cities were connected by narrow roads paved with blocks cut with bronze saws. Streets were drained, and water and sewage facilities were available to the upper class through clay pipes.Minoan buildings often had flat, tiled roofs; plaster, wood or flagstone floors, and stood two to three stories high. Lower walls were typically constructed of stone and rubble, and the upper walls of mudbrick. Ceiling timbers held up the roofs.\nConstruction materials for villas and palaces varied, and included sandstone, gypsum and limestone. Building techniques also varied, with some palaces using ashlar masonry and others roughly-hewn, megalithic blocks.\nIn north-central Crete blue-greenschist was used as to pave floors of streets and courtyards between 1650 and 1600 BC. These rocks were likely quarried in Agia Pelagia on the north coast of central Crete.\n\n\n==== Palaces ====\n\nPalaces (anaktora) are the best-known Minoan building types excavated on Crete. They are monumental buildings with administrative purposes, as evidenced by large archives unearthed by archaeologists. Each palace excavated to date has unique features, but they also share aspects which set them apart from other structures. Palaces are often multi-story, with interior and exterior staircases, lightwells, massive columns, storage areas and courtyards.\nThe first palaces were constructed at the end of the Early Minoan period in the third millennium BC at Malia. Although it was formerly believed that the foundation of the first palaces was synchronous and dated to the Middle Minoan period (around 2000 BC, the date of the first palace at Knossos), scholars now think that the palaces were built over a longer period in response to local developments. The main older palaces are Knossos, Malia and Phaistos. Elements of the Middle Minoan palaces (at Knossos, Phaistos and Malia, for example) have precedents in Early Minoan construction styles. These include an indented western court and special treatment of the western fa\u00e7ade. One example is the House on the Hill at Vasiliki, dated to the Early Minoan II period. The palaces were centers of government, administrative offices, shrines, workshops and storage spaces.The Middle Minoan palaces are characteristically aligned with their surrounding topography. The MM palace of Phaistos appears to align with Mount Ida and Knossos is aligned with Mount Juktas, both on a north\u2013south axis. Scholars suggest that the alignment was related to the mountains' ritual significance; a number of peak sanctuaries (spaces for public ritual) have been excavated, including one at Petsofas. These sites have yielded clusters of clay figurines and evidence of animal sacrifice.\nLate palaces are characterized by multi-story buildings with west facades of sandstone ashlar masonry; Knossos is the best-known example. Other building conventions included storage areas, north\u2013south orientation, a pillar room and a western court. Architecture during the First Palace Period is identified by a square-within-a-square style; Second Palace Period construction has more internal divisions and corridors. The Palace of Knossos was the largest Minoan palace. The palace is about 150 meters across and it spreads over an area of some 20,000 square meters, with its original upper levels possibly having a thousand chambers. The palace is connected to the mythological story of The Bull of Minos, since it is in this palace where it was written that the labyrinth existed. Focusing on the architectural aspects of the Palace of Knossos, it was a combination of foundations that depended on the aspects of its walls for the dimensions of the rooms, staircases, porticos, and chambers. The palace was designed in such a fashion that the structure was laid out to surround the central court of the Minoans. Aesthetically speaking, the pillars along with the stone paved northern entrance gave the palace a look and feel that was unique to the Palace of Knossos. The space surrounding the court was covered with rooms and hallways, some of which were stacked on top of the lower levels of the palace being linked through multiple ramps and staircases. Others were built into a hill, as described by the site's excavator Arthur John Evans, \"...The palace of Knossos is the most extensive and occupies several hills.\" On the east side of the court there was a grand staircase passing through the many levels of the palace, added for the royal residents. On the west side of the court, the throne room, a modest room with a ceiling some two meters high, can be found along with the frescoes that were decorating the walls of the hallways and storage rooms.\n\n\n==== Plumbing ====\nDuring the Minoan Era extensive waterways were built in order to protect the growing population. These system had two primary functions, first providing and distributing water, and secondly relocating sewage and stormwater. One of the defining aspects of the Minoan Era was the architectural feats of their waste management. The Minoans used technologies such as wells, cisterns, and aqueducts to manage their water supplies. Structural aspects of their buildings even played a part. Flat roofs and plentiful open courtyards were used for collecting water to be stored in cisterns. Significantly, the Minoans had water treatment devices. One such device seems to have been a porous clay pipe through which water was allowed to flow until clean.\n\n\n==== Columns ====\n\nFor sustaining of the roof, some higher houses, especially the palaces, used columns made usually of cupressus sempervirens, and sometimes of stone. One of the most notable Minoan contributions to architecture is their inverted column, wider at the top than the base (unlike most Greek columns, which are wider at the bottom to give an impression of height). The columns were made of wood (not stone) and were generally painted red. Mounted on a simple stone base, they were topped with a pillow-like, round capital.\n\n\n==== Villas ====\nA number of compounds known as \"villas\" have been excavated on Crete. These structures share features of neopalatial palaces: a conspicuous western facade, storage facilities and a three-part Minoan Hall. These features may indicate a similar role or that the structures were artistic imitations, suggesting that their occupants were familiar with palatial culture. The villas were often richly decorated, as evidenced by the frescos of Haghia Triadha Villa A.\nA common characteristic of the Minoan villas was having flat roofs. Their rooms didn't have windows to the streets, the light arriving from courtyards. In the 2nd millennium BC, the villas had one or two floors, and the palaces even three.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nThe largest collection of Minoan art is in the museum at Heraklion, near Knossos, on the northern coast of Crete. Minoan art and other remnants of material culture, especially the sequence of ceramic styles, have been used by archaeologists to define the three phases of Minoan culture (EM, MM, LM).\nSince wood and textiles have decomposed, the best-preserved (and most instructive) surviving examples of Minoan art are its pottery, palace architecture (with frescos which include landscapes), stone carvings and intricately-carved seal stones.\nFrescoes were the primary art form of Minoan culture. They include many depictions of people, with sexes distinguished by color; the men's skin is reddish-brown, and the women's white. Several frescoes at Knossos and Santorini survive. In contrast to Egyptian frescoes, Crete had true frescoes. Probably the most famous fresco is the bull-leaping fresco. The main colours used in Minoan frescos were black (shale), white (slaked lime), red (hematite), yellow (ochre), blue (copper silicate) and green (yellow and blue mixed together).\n\n\n==== Pottery ====\n\nA variety of wares were produced in Crete. Early Minoan ceramics were characterized by patterns of spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses, fish bones, and beak-spouts. During the Middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs (such as fish, squid, birds and lilies) were common. In the Late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still characteristic but more variety existed.\nThe palace style of the region around Knossos is characterized by geometric simplicity and monochromatic painting. Late Minoan art resembles that of Mycenae. Minoan knowledge of the sea was continued by the Mycenaeans in their frequent use of marine forms as artistic motifs. The so-called \"marine style\" has the entire surface of a pot covered with sea creatures, octopus, fish and dolphins, against a background of rocks, seaweed and sponges.\n\n\n==== Jewelry ====\nThe Minoans created elaborate metalwork with imported gold and copper. Bead necklaces, bracelets and hair ornaments appear in the frescoes, and many labrys pins survive. The Minoans apparently mastered faience and granulation, as indicated by a gold bee pendant. Minoan metalworking included intense, precise temperature, to bond gold to itself without burning it.\n\n\n==== Metal vessels ====\n\nMetal vessels were produced in Crete from at least as early as EM II (c. 2500 BC) in the Prepalatial period through to LM IA (c. 1450 BC) in the Postpalatial period and perhaps as late as LM IIIB/C (c. 1200 BC), although it is likely that many of the vessels from these later periods were heirlooms from earlier periods.  The earliest were probably made exclusively from precious metals, but from the Protopalatial period (MM IB \u2013 MM IIA) they were also produced in arsenical bronze and, subsequently, tin bronze.  The archaeological record suggests that mostly cup-type forms were created in precious metals, but the corpus of bronze vessels was diverse, including cauldrons, pans, hydrias, bowls, pitchers, basins, cups, ladles and lamps.  The Minoan metal vessel tradition influenced that of the Mycenaean culture on mainland Greece, and they are often regarded as the same tradition.  Many precious metal vessels found on mainland Greece exhibit Minoan characteristics, and it is thought that these were either imported from Crete or made on the mainland by Minoan metalsmiths working for Mycenaean patrons or by Mycenaean smiths who had trained under Minoan masters.\n\n\n=== Warfare and the \"Minoan peace\" ===\nAccording to Arthur Evans, a \"Minoan peace\" (Pax Minoica) existed; there was little internal armed conflict in Minoan Crete until the Mycenaean period. However, it is difficult to draw hard-and-fast conclusions from the evidence and Evans' idealistic view has been questioned.No evidence has been found of a Minoan army or the Minoan domination of peoples beyond Crete, and few signs of warfare appear in Minoan art: \"Although a few archaeologists see war scenes in a few pieces of Minoan art, others interpret even these scenes as festivals, sacred dance, or sports events\" (Studebaker, 2004, p. 27). Although armed warriors are depicted as stabbed in the throat with swords, the violence may be part of a ritual or blood sport.On mainland Greece during the shaft-grave era at Mycenae, there is little evidence for major Mycenaean fortifications; the citadels follow the destruction of nearly all neopalatial Cretan sites. Warfare by other contemporaries of the ancient Minoans, such as the Egyptians and the Hittites, is well-documented.\n\n\n==== Skepticism and weaponry ====\n\nDespite finding ruined watchtowers and fortification walls, Evans said that there was little evidence of ancient Minoan fortifications. According to Stylianos Alexiou (in Kretologia 8), a number of sites (especially early and middle Minoan sites such as Aghia Photia) are built on hilltops or otherwise fortified. Lucia Nixon wrote:\n\nWe may have been over-influenced by the lack of what we might think of as solid fortifications to assess the archaeological evidence properly. As in so many other instances, we may not have been looking for evidence in the right places, and therefore we may not end with a correct assessment of the Minoans and their ability to avoid war.\nChester Starr said in \"Minoan Flower Lovers\" that since Shang China and the Maya had unfortified centers and engaged in frontier struggles, a lack of fortifications alone does not prove that the Minoans were a peaceful civilization unparalleled in history. In 1998, when Minoan archaeologists met in a Belgian conference to discuss the possibility that the Pax Minoica was outdated, evidence of Minoan war was still scanty. According to Jan Driessen, the Minoans frequently depicted \"weapons\" in their art in a ritual context:\n\nThe construction of fortified sites is often assumed to reflect a threat of warfare, but such fortified centres were multifunctional; they were also often the embodiment or material expression of the central places of the territories at the same time as being monuments glorifying and merging leading power.\nStella Chryssoulaki's work on small outposts (or guardhouses) in eastern Crete indicates a possible defensive system; type A (high-quality) Minoan swords were found in the palaces of Mallia and Zarkos (see Sanders, AJA 65, 67, Hoeckmann, JRGZM 27, or Rehak and Younger, AJA 102). Keith Branigan estimated that 95 percent of Minoan \"weapons\" had hafting (hilts or handles) which would have prevented their use as such. However, tests of replicas indicated that the weapons could cut flesh down to the bone (and score the bone's surface) without damaging the weapons themselves. According to Paul Rehak, Minoan figure-eight shields could not have been used for fighting or hunting, since they were too cumbersome. Although Cheryl Floyd concluded that Minoan \"weapons\" were tools used for mundane tasks such as meat processing,  Middle Minoan \"rapiers nearly three feet in length\" have been found.About Minoan warfare, Branigan concluded:\n\nThe quantity of weaponry, the impressive fortifications, and the aggressive looking long-boats all suggested an era of intensified hostilities. But on closer inspection there are grounds for thinking that all three key elements are bound up as much with status statements, display, and fashion as with aggression;... Warfare such as there was in the southern Aegean early Bronze Age was either personalized and perhaps ritualized (in Crete) or small-scale, intermittent and essentially an economic activity (in the Cyclades and the Argolid/Attica).\nArchaeologist Olga Krzyszkowska agreed: \"The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no direct evidence for war and warfare per se.\"\n\n\n== Collapse ==\n\nBetween 1935 and 1939, Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited the Minoan eruption theory. An eruption on the island of Thera (present-day Santorini), about 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Crete, occurred during the LM IA period (1550\u20131500 BC). One of the largest volcanic explosions in recorded history, it ejected about 60 to 100 cubic kilometres (14 to 24 cu mi) of material and was measured at 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini, which was entombed in a layer of pumice.\nAlthough it is believed to have severely affected the Minoan culture of Crete, the extent of its effects has been debated. Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant life on the eastern half of Crete, starving the local population; however, more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more than 5 millimetres (0.20 in) of ash fell anywhere on Crete. Based on archaeological evidence, studies indicate that a massive tsunami generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements. Although the LM IIIA (late Minoan) period is characterized by affluence (wealthy tombs, burials and art) and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles, by LM IIIB Knossos' wealth and importance as a regional center apparently declined.\nSignificant remains have been found above the late Minoan I-era Thera ash layer, implying that the Thera eruption did not cause the immediate collapse of Minoan civilization. The Minoans were a sea power, however, and the Thera eruption probably caused significant economic hardship. Whether this was enough to trigger a Minoan downfall is debated. Mycenaean Greece conquered the Minoans during the late Minoan II period, and Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete soon after the eruption.Many archaeologists believe that the eruption triggered a crisis, making the Minoans vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans. According to Sinclair Hood, the Minoans were most likely conquered by an invading force. Although the civilization's collapse was aided by the Thera eruption, its ultimate end came from conquest. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was destroyed by fire, with the palace at Knossos receiving less damage than other sites on Crete. Since natural disasters are not selective, the uneven destruction was probably caused by invaders who would have seen the usefulness of preserving a palace like Knossos for their own use. Several authors have noted evidence that Minoan civilization had exceeded its environmental carrying capacity, with archaeological recovery at Knossos indicating deforestation in the region near the civilization's later stages.\n\n\n== Genetic studies ==\nA 2013 archeogenetics study compared skeletal mtDNA from ancient Minoan skeletons that were sealed in a cave in the Lasithi Plateau between 3,700 and 4,400 years ago, to 135 samples from Greece, Anatolia, western and northern Europe, North Africa and Egypt. The researchers found that the Minoan skeletons were genetically very similar to modern-day Europeans\u2014and especially close to modern-day Cretans, particularly those from the Lasithi Plateau. They were also genetically similar to Neolithic Europeans, but distinct from Egyptian or Libyan populations. \"We now know that the founders of the first advanced European civilization were European,\" said study co-author George Stamatoyannopoulos, a human geneticist at the University of Washington. \"They were very similar to Neolithic Europeans and very similar to present day-Cretans.\"A 2017 archeogenetics full genome sequencing study of Minoan remains published in the journal Nature concluded that the Mycenean Greeks were genetically closely related with the Minoans, and that both are closely related, but not identical, to modern Greek populations. The same study also stated that at least three-quarters of the ancestral DNA of both the Minoans and the Myceneans came from the first Neolithic-era farmers that lived in Western Anatolia and the Aegean Sea. The remaining ancestry of the Minoans came from prehistoric populations related to those of the Caucasus and Iran, while the Mycenaean Greeks also carried this component. Unlike the Minoans however, the Myceneans carried a small 13-18% Bronze Age Pontic-Caspian steppe component. Whether the 'northern' ancestry in Mycenaeans was due to sporadic infiltration of Steppe-related populations in Greece, or the result of a rapid migration as in Central Europe, is not certain yet. Such a migration would support the idea that Proto-Greek speakers formed the southern wing of a steppe intrusion of Indo-European speakers. Yet, the absence of \u2018northern\u2019 ancestry in the Bronze Age samples from Pisidia, where Indo-European languages were attested in antiquity, casts doubt on this genetic-linguistic association, with further sampling of ancient Anatolian speakers needed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtlantis\nCaucasus\nHyksos\nMinoa\nSacred caves of Crete\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

It has an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi).\nCrete and a number of islands and islets that surround it constitute the Region of Crete (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), which is the southernmost of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece, and the fifth most populous of Greece\u2018s regions. Its capital and largest city is Heraklion, located on the north shore of the island. As of 2011, the region had a population of 623,065. The Dodecanese are located to the northeast of Crete, while the Cyclades are situated to the north, separated by the Sea of Crete. The Peloponnese is to the region's northwest.\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Crete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.\nThe island is mostly mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, Mount Ida, and the range of the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above 2000 metres in altitude and the Samaria Gorge, a World Biosphere Reserve. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own poetry and music). The Nikos Kazantzakis airport at Heraklion and the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania serve international travelers. The palace of Knossos, a Bronze Age settlement and ancient Minoan city, is also located in Heraklion.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating from the 18th century BC, where the island is referred to as Kaptara. This is repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and the Bible (Caphtor). It was known in ancient Egyptian as Keftiu or kft\u0131\u0357w, strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.The current name \"Crete\" is first attested in the 15th century BC in Mycenaean Greek texts, written in Linear B, through the words ke-re-te (*Kr\u0113tes; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0.tes], plural of \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0s]) and ke-re-si-jo (*Kr\u0113sijos; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [kr\u03ad\u02d0sios], \"Cretan\"). In Ancient Greek, the name Crete (\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7) first appears in Homer's Odyssey.In Latin, the name of the island became Creta. The original Arabic name of Crete was Iqr\u012b\u1e6di\u0161 (Arabic: \u0627\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0634\u200e < (\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), but after the Emirate of Crete's establishment of its new capital at \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642 Rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2aandaq (modern Iraklion), both the city and the island became known as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Chandax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Chandakas), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian Candia, from which were derived French Candie and English Candy or Candia. Under Ottoman rule, in Ottoman Turkish, Crete was called Girit (\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a).\n\n\n== Physical geography ==\n\nCrete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea.\n\n\n=== Island morphology ===\nThe island has an elongated shape: it spans 260 km (160 mi) from east to west, is 60 km (37 mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12 km (7.5 mi) (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi), with a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi); to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); to the south, the South Cretian Sea (Greek: \u039d\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland.\n\n\n=== Mountains and valleys ===\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:\n\nThe White Mountains or Lefka Ori 2,454 m (8,051 ft)\nThe Idi Range (Psiloritis 35.18\u00b0N 24.82\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.18; 24.82 2,456 m (8,058 ft)\nAsterousia Mountains 1,231 m (4,039 ft)\nKedros 1,777 m (5,830 ft)\nThe Dikti Mountains 2,148 m (7,047 ft)\nThripti 1,489 m (4,885 ft)These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus); and a number of gorges.\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.\n\n\n=== Gorges, rivers and lakes ===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the Samari\u00e1 Gorge, Imbros Gorge, Kourtaliotiko Gorge, Ha Gorge, Platania Gorge, the Gorge of the Dead (at Kato Zakros, Sitia) and Richtis Gorge and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in Sitia.The rivers of Crete include the Ieropotamos River, the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake Kournas and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit. Lake Voulismeni at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi. Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of Aposelemis Dam, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Surrounding islands ===\n\nA large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands includes:\n\nGramvousa (Kissamos, Chania) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\nElafonisi (Chania), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\nChrysi island (Ierapetra, Lasithi), which hosts the largest natural Lebanon cedar forest in Europe\nPaximadia island (Agia Galini, Rethymno) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\nThe Venetian fort and leper colony at Spinalonga opposite the beach and shallow waters of Elounda (Agios Nikolaos, Lasithi)\nDionysades islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of Vai in the municipality of Sitia, LasithiOff the south coast, the island of Gavdos is located 26 nautical miles (48 km) south of Hora Sfakion and is the southernmost point of Europe.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the North African, mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily Mediterranean. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\nThe south coast, including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains, falls in the North African climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, date palms bear fruit, and swallows remain year-round rather than migrate to Africa. The fertile region around Ierapetra, on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in greenhouses throughout the winter. Western Crete (Chania province) receives more rain and the soils there suffer more erosion compared to the Eastern part of Crete.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCrete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nCrete with its nearby islands form the Crete Region (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ria Kr\u00edtis, [peri\u02c8feria \u02c8kritis]), one of the 13 regions of Greece which were established in the 1987 administrative reform. Under the 2010 Kallikratis plan, the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at Heraklion and is divided into four regional units (pre-Kallikratis prefectures). From west to east these are: Chania, Rethymno, Heraklion, and Lasithi. These are further subdivided into 24 municipalities.\nThe region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, Stavros Arnaoutakis, who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.\n\n\n=== Cities ===\n\nHeraklion is the largest city and capital of Crete. Chania was the capital until 1971. The principal cities are:\n\nHeraklion (Iraklion or Candia) (151,324 inhabitants)\nChania (Hani\u00e1) (53,910 inhabitants)\nRethymno (34,300 inhabitants)\nIerapetra (23,707 inhabitants)\nAgios Nikolaos (20,679 inhabitants)\nSitia (14,338 inhabitants)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\nThe economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry. The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\nAs in many regions of Greece, viticulture and olive groves are significant; oranges, citrons and avocadoes are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as mizithra, anthotyros, and kefalotyri.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.\n\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\nThe island has three significant airports, Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion, the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania and a smaller one in Sitia. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from Athens, by ferry companies such as Minoan Lines and ANEK Lines.\n\n\n==== Road Network ====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway. In addition, a European study has been devised from European Union to promote a modern highway that will connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. According to the study the project should be include 15.7 km of section of road between the villages Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete, benefits both tourists and local people by improving the accessibility to the southern part of the island and lessen the accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete's capital city Heraklion, which provides the island's airport and principal sea port link with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes. The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.  \nThe investment falls under Greece's \"Improvement of Accessibility\" Operational Programme. The programme aims to improve the country's transport infrastructures as well as its international connections. It will therefore have a key role to play in making Greece's remote and landlocked regions more accessible and economically attractive. This Operational Programme works to link Greece's more prosperous and less developed regions, which should help to promote greater territorial cohesion.\nTotal investment for the project \"Completion of construction of the section of Ag. Varvara - Ag. Deka (Kastelli) (22+170 km to 37+900 km) of the vertical road axis Irakleio \u2013 Messara in the prefecture of Irakleio, Kriti\" is EUR 102 273 321, of which the EU's European Regional Development Fund is contributing EUR 86 932 323 from the Operational Programme \"Improvement of Accessibility\" for the 2007 to 2013 programming period. Work falls under the priority \"Road Transport \u2013 trans-European and trans-regional route network of the regions on the Convergence objective\".\n\n\n==== Railway ====\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nNewspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, South Korea, Dubai Ports World and China for the construction of a large international container port and free trade zone in southern Crete near Tympaki; the plan is to expropriate 850 ha of land. The port would handle 2 million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact. As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to approve it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.\nThere are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus: EuroAfrica Interconnector and EuroAsia Interconnector. They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece, ending energy isolation of Crete. Now Hellenic Republic covers for Crete electricity costs difference of around \u20ac300 million per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Emirate of Crete, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. After a brief period of independence (1897\u20131913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\n\n\n=== Prehistoric Crete ===\n\nIn 2002, the paleontologist Gerard Gierlinski discovered fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5,600,000 years ago.The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Settlements dating to the aceramic Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC, used cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs as well as domesticated cereals and legumes; ancient Knossos was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later Minoan) sites. Other neolithic settlements include those at Kephala, Magasa, and Trapeza.\n\n\n=== Minoan civilization ===\n\nCrete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoan (c. 2700\u20131420 BC). This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as Linear A. Early Cretan history is replete with legends such as those of King Minos, Theseus and the Minotaur, passed on orally via poets such as Homer. The volcanic eruption of Thera may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization.\n\n\n=== Mycenaean civilization ===\n\nIn 1420 BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by Michael Ventris, is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425\u20131375 BC.\n\n\n=== Archaic and Classical period ===\nAfter the Bronze Age collapse, Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the Archaic period. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The Gortyn code (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified civil law established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, Gortyn, Kydonia (Chania), Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two opposing coalitions of cities. As a result, the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (Ierapetra) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\n\nCrete was involved in the Mithridatic Wars, initially repelling an attack by Roman general Marcus Antonius Creticus in 71 BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69 BC, earning for Metellus the title \"Creticus\". Gortyn was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with Cyrenaica that was called Creta et Cyrenaica. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire. In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the Panhellenion, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period ===\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica c.\u2009297. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by Vandals in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by Slavs in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In c.\u2009732, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the Pope to that of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Andalusian Arab rule ===\n\nIn the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman, and then Eastern Roman (Byzantine) island, Crete was captured by Andalusian Muladis led by Abu Hafs, who established the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, Nikephoros Phokas' campaign completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 second period ===\n\nIn 961, Nikephoros Phokas returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon \"the Metanoeite\". The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.\nIn 1204, the Fourth Crusade seized and sacked the imperial capital of Constantinople. Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader Boniface of Montferrat in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the Republic of Venice, whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the Republic of Genoa immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.\n\n\n=== Venetian rule ===\n\nFrom 1212, during Venice's rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a Renaissance swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as The Cretan School or Post-Byzantine Art, it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter El Greco and the writers Nicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707), Georgios Kalafatis (professor) (c.\u20091652\u20131720), Andreas Musalus (c.\u20091665\u20131721) and Vitsentzos Kornaros.Under the rule of the Catholic Venetians, the city of Candia was reputed to be the best fortified city of the Eastern Mediterranean. The three main forts were located at Gramvousa, Spinalonga, and Fortezza at Rethymnon. Other fortifications include the Kazarma fortress at Sitia. In 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island. In 1574\u201377, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and Inquisitor. According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population. Marco Foscarini was the Doge of Venice during this time period.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nThe Ottomans conquered Crete in 1669, after the siege of Candia. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the Republic of Venice after the Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars, some even prospering such as the family of Simone Stratigo (c. 1733 \u2013 c. 1824) who migrated to Dalmatia from Crete in 1669. Islamic presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the Arab occupation, was cemented by the Ottoman conquest. Most Cretan Muslims were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan Greek, but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks. Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim. A number of Sufi orders were widespread throughout the island, the Bektashi order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five tekkes. Many Cretan Turks fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by Daskalogiannis, a shipowner from Sfakia who was promised support by Orlov's fleet which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the London Protocol of 1830, and soon it was yielded to Egypt by the Ottoman sultan. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the Convention of London on 3 July 1840.\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\". The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach. The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of real-estate transactions during the Ottoman rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\nThe Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869 or Great Cretan Revolution (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the Holocaust of Arkadi. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the Arkadi Monastery, which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n\n=== Cretan State 1898\u20131908 ===\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the Great Powers decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the near future.In September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, Prince George of Greece, appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898. The flag of the Cretan State was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.\n\nIn 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos \nover the question of the enosis (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the Theriso revolt, one of the leaders being Eleftherios Venizelos.\nPrince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.\nWith the break out of the First Balkan War, the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring World War II, the island was the scene of the famous Battle of Crete in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and Adolf Hitler forbade further large-scale paratroop operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the Massacre of Kondomari and the Viannos massacres. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nCrete was one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion seven years ago made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece. Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back, when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.\nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and Chania and a smaller airport in Sitia (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012) or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, Rethimno, Agios Nikolaos and Sitia.\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of Chania, the Venetian castle at Rethymno, the gorge of Samaria, the islands of Chrysi, Elafonisi, Gramvousa, Spinalonga and the Palm Beach of Vai, which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in Heraklion. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.\n\n\n=== Holiday homes and immigration ===\nCrete's mild climate attracts interest from northern Europeans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. EU citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality. A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British immigrants, followed by German, Dutch, Scandinavian and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The British immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of Chania and Rethymno and to a lesser extent in Heraklion and Lasithi.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites and museums ===\n\nThe area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of Knossos, Malia (not to be confused with the town of the same name), Petras and Phaistos, the classical site of Gortys, and the diverse archaeology of the island of Koufonisi, which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to the latter has been restricted for the last few years, so it is best to check before heading to a port).\nThere are a number of museums throughout Crete. The Heraklion Archaeological Museum displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.\n\n\n=== Harmful effects ===\nHelen Briassoulis proposed in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism that Crete is a victim of external tourist systems applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of Hercules (who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all \"harmful\" and \"venomous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the Apostle Paul, who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a natural history museum, the Natural History Museum of Crete, operating under the direction of the University of Crete and two aquariums \u2013 Aquaworld in Hersonissos and Cretaquarium in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n\n==== Prehistoric fauna ====\nDwarf elephants, dwarf hippopotamus, dwarf mammoths, dwarf deer, and giant flightless owls were native to Pleistocene Crete.\n\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nMammals of Crete include the vulnerable kri-kri, Capra aegagrus cretica that can be seen in the national park of the Samaria Gorge and on Thodorou, Dia and Agioi Pantes (islets off the north coast), the Cretan wildcat and the Cretan spiny mouse. Other terrestrial mammals include subspecies of the Cretan marten, the Cretan weasel, the Cretan badger, the long-eared hedgehog, and the edible dormouse.The Cretan shrew, a type of white-toothed shrew is considered endemic to the island of Crete because this species of shrew is unknown elsewhere. It is a relic species of the crocidura shrews of which fossils have been found that can be dated to the Pleistocene era. In the present day it can only be found in the highlands of Crete. It is considered to be the only surviving remnant of the endemic species of the Pleistocene Mediterranean islands.Bat species include: Blasius's horseshoe bat, the lesser horseshoe bat, the greater horseshoe bat, the lesser mouse-eared bat, Geoffroy's bat, the whiskered bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle, the common pipistrelle, Savi's pipistrelle, the serotine bat, the long-eared bat, Schreibers' bat and the European free-tailed bat.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Birds ====\nA large variety of birds includes eagles (can be seen in Lasithi), swallows (throughout Crete in the summer and all the year in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and common cranes (including Gavdos and Gavdopoula). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered lammergeier vulture. Bird species include: the golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, the bearded vulture or lammergeier, the griffon vulture, Eleanora's falcon, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon, European kestrel, tawny owl, little owl, hooded crow, alpine chough, red-billed chough, and the Eurasian hoopoe.\n\n\n==== Reptiles and amphibians ====\nTortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.\nReptiles include the Aegean wall lizard, Balkan green lizard, common chameleon, ocellated skink, snake-eyed skink, moorish gecko, Turkish gecko, Kotschy's gecko, spur-thighed tortoise, and the Caspian turtle.There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the leopard snake (locally known as Ochendra), the Balkan whip snake (locally called Dendrogallia), the dice snake (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal cat snake which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.Sea turtles include the green turtle and the loggerhead turtle which are both threatened species. The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.Amphibians include the European green toad, American bullfrog (introduced), European tree frog, and the Cretan marsh frog (endemic).\n\n\n==== Arthropods ====\nCrete has an unusual variety of insects. Cicadas, known locally as Tzitzikia, make a distinctive repetitive tzi tzi sound that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the swallowtail butterfly. Moth species include the hummingbird moth. There are several species of scorpion such as Euscorpius carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.\n\n\n==== Crustaceans and molluscs ====\nRiver crabs include the semi-terrestrial Potamon potamios crab. Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.\n\n\n==== Sealife ====\nApart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks at present, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Apart from the famous endangered Mediterranean monk seal, which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts whales, sperm whales, dolphins and porpoises. These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. Squid and octopus can be found along the coast and sea turtles and hammerhead sharks swim in the sea around the coast. The Cretaquarium and the Aquaworld Aquarium, are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece. They are located in Gournes and Hersonissos respectively. Examples of the local sealife can be seen there.Some of the fish that can be seen in the waters around Crete include: scorpion fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the flying gurnard.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe Minoans contributed to the deforestation of Crete. Further deforestation occurred in the 1600s \"so that no more local supplies of firewood were available\".Common wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladiolus, hyacinth, iris, poppy, cyclamen and tulip, among others. There are more than 200 different species of wild orchid on the island and this includes 14 varieties of Ophrys cretica. Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Rare herbs include the endemic Cretan dittany. and ironwort, Sideritis syriaca, known as Malotira (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1). Varieties of cactus include the edible prickly pear. Common trees on the island include the chestnut, cypress, oak, olive tree, pine, plane, and tamarisk. Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Environmentally protected areas ===\nThere are a number of environmentally protected areas. One such area is located at the island of Elafonisi on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of Vai in eastern Crete and the Dionysades (both in the municipality of Sitia, Lasithi), have diverse animal and plant life. Vai has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of Chrysi, 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of Ierapetra, has the largest naturally-grown Juniperus macrocarpa forest in Europe. Samaria Gorge is a World Biosphere Reserve and Richtis Gorge is protected for its landscape diversity.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\nCrete has a strong association with Ancient Greek Gods but is also connected with the Minoan civilisation.\nAccording to Greek Mythology, The Diktaean Cave at Mount Dikti was the birthplace of the god Zeus. The Paximadia islands were the birthplace of the goddess Artemis and the god Apollo. Their mother, the goddess Leto, was worshipped at Phaistos. The goddess Athena bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of Dia. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of Lefkai were the result of a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of Souda and Leon). Heracles, in one of his labors, took the Cretan bull to the Peloponnese. Europa and Zeus made love at Gortys and conceived the kings of Crete: Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, and Minos.\nThe labyrinth of the Palace of Knossos was the setting for the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. Icarus and Daedalus were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death King Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades, while Rhadamanthys became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCrete has its own distinctive Mantinades poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based music (typically performed with the Cretan lyra and the laouto) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the Pentozali. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.Cretan authors have made important contributions to Greek literature throughout the modern period; major names include Vikentios Kornaros, creator of the 17th-century epic romance Erotokritos (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, Nikos Kazantzakis. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the Cretan School of icon painting, which influenced El Greco and through him subsequent European painting.\nCrete is also famous for its traditional cuisine. The nutritional value of the Cretan cuisine was discovered by the American epidemiologist Ancel Keys in the 1960, being later often mentioned by epidemiologists as one of the best examples of the Mediterranean diet.Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (stivania), vr\u00e1ka breeches tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (sariki). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of masculinity.\nCretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan vendettas which persist on the island to date. Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun. Guns are subject to strict regulation from the Greek government, and in recent years a great deal of effort to control firearms in Crete has been undertaken by the Greek police, but with limited success.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nCrete has many football clubs playing in the local leagues. During the 2011\u201312 season, OFI Crete, which plays at Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium (Iraklion), and Ergotelis F.C., which plays at the Pankritio Stadium (Iraklion) were both members of the Greek Superleague. During the 2012\u201313 season, OFI Crete, which plays at Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium (Iraklion), and Platanias F.C., which plays at the Perivolia Municipal Stadium, near Chania, are both members of the Greek Superleague.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nNotable people from Crete include:\n\nNikos Kazantzakis, author, born in Heraklion, 7 times suggested for the Nobel Prize\nOdysseas Elytis, poet, awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1979, born in Heraklion\nGeorgios Chortatzis, Renaissance author\nVitsentzos Kornaros, Renaissance author from Sitia, who lived in Heraklion (then Candia)\nDomenikos Theotokopoulos (El Greco), Renaissance artist, born in Heraklion\nNikos Xilouris, famous composer and singer.\nPsarantonis, Cretan folk singer and Cretan lyra player and brother of Nikos Xilouris.\nNana Mouskouri, singer, born in Chania\nEleftherios Venizelos, former Greek Prime Minister, born in Chania Prefecture\nKonstantinos Mitsotakis, nephew of Eleftherios Venizelos and Prime Minister of Greece.\nDaskalogiannis, leader of the Orlov Revolt in Crete in 1770\nMichalis Kourmoulis, leader of the Greek War of Independence from Messara.\nEleni Daniilidou, tennis player, born in Chania\nLouis Tikas, Greek-American labor union leader\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian writer, born in Heraklion\nNick Dandolos, a.k.a.

        "wiki": "Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7, Modern: Kr\u00edti, ['kriti], Ancient: Kr\u1e17t\u0113, [kr\u03ad\u02d0t\u03b5\u02d0]; Egyptian: \ud80c\udfa1\ud80c\udd91\ud80c\udf58\ud80c\udd71\ud80c\ude09, keftiu; Biblical Hebrew: \u05db\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u200e, caphtor; Turkish: Girit) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 88th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus and Corsica. It bounds the southern border of the Aegean sea. Crete lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland. It has an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi).\nCrete and a number of islands and islets that surround it constitute the Region of Crete (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), which is the southernmost of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece, and the fifth most populous of Greece\u2018s regions. Its capital and largest city is Heraklion, located on the north shore of the island. As of 2011, the region had a population of 623,065. The Dodecanese are located to the northeast of Crete, while the Cyclades are situated to the north, separated by the Sea of Crete. The Peloponnese is to the region's northwest.\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Crete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.\nThe island is mostly mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, Mount Ida, and the range of the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above 2000 metres in altitude and the Samaria Gorge, a World Biosphere Reserve. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own poetry and music). The Nikos Kazantzakis airport at Heraklion and the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania serve international travelers. The palace of Knossos, a Bronze Age settlement and ancient Minoan city, is also located in Heraklion.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating from the 18th century BC, where the island is referred to as Kaptara. This is repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and the Bible (Caphtor). It was known in ancient Egyptian as Keftiu or kft\u0131\u0357w, strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.The current name \"Crete\" is first attested in the 15th century BC in Mycenaean Greek texts, written in Linear B, through the words ke-re-te (*Kr\u0113tes; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0.tes], plural of \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 [kr\u025b\u02d0s]) and ke-re-si-jo (*Kr\u0113sijos; later Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [kr\u03ad\u02d0sios], \"Cretan\"). In Ancient Greek, the name Crete (\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7) first appears in Homer's Odyssey.In Latin, the name of the island became Creta. The original Arabic name of Crete was Iqr\u012b\u1e6di\u0161 (Arabic: \u0627\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0634\u200e < (\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), but after the Emirate of Crete's establishment of its new capital at \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642 Rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2aandaq (modern Iraklion), both the city and the island became known as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Chandax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Chandakas), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian Candia, from which were derived French Candie and English Candy or Candia. Under Ottoman rule, in Ottoman Turkish, Crete was called Girit (\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a).\n\n\n== Physical geography ==\n\nCrete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea.\n\n\n=== Island morphology ===\nThe island has an elongated shape: it spans 260 km (160 mi) from east to west, is 60 km (37 mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12 km (7.5 mi) (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi), with a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi); to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); to the south, the South Cretian Sea (Greek: \u039d\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland.\n\n\n=== Mountains and valleys ===\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:\n\nThe White Mountains or Lefka Ori 2,454 m (8,051 ft)\nThe Idi Range (Psiloritis 35.18\u00b0N 24.82\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.18; 24.82 2,456 m (8,058 ft)\nAsterousia Mountains 1,231 m (4,039 ft)\nKedros 1,777 m (5,830 ft)\nThe Dikti Mountains 2,148 m (7,047 ft)\nThripti 1,489 m (4,885 ft)These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus); and a number of gorges.\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.\n\n\n=== Gorges, rivers and lakes ===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the Samari\u00e1 Gorge, Imbros Gorge, Kourtaliotiko Gorge, Ha Gorge, Platania Gorge, the Gorge of the Dead (at Kato Zakros, Sitia) and Richtis Gorge and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in Sitia.The rivers of Crete include the Ieropotamos River, the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake Kournas and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit. Lake Voulismeni at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi. Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of Aposelemis Dam, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Surrounding islands ===\n\nA large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands includes:\n\nGramvousa (Kissamos, Chania) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\nElafonisi (Chania), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\nChrysi island (Ierapetra, Lasithi), which hosts the largest natural Lebanon cedar forest in Europe\nPaximadia island (Agia Galini, Rethymno) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\nThe Venetian fort and leper colony at Spinalonga opposite the beach and shallow waters of Elounda (Agios Nikolaos, Lasithi)\nDionysades islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of Vai in the municipality of Sitia, LasithiOff the south coast, the island of Gavdos is located 26 nautical miles (48 km) south of Hora Sfakion and is the southernmost point of Europe.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the North African, mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily Mediterranean. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\nThe south coast, including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains, falls in the North African climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, date palms bear fruit, and swallows remain year-round rather than migrate to Africa. The fertile region around Ierapetra, on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in greenhouses throughout the winter. Western Crete (Chania province) receives more rain and the soils there suffer more erosion compared to the Eastern part of Crete.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCrete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nCrete with its nearby islands form the Crete Region (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ria Kr\u00edtis, [peri\u02c8feria \u02c8kritis]), one of the 13 regions of Greece which were established in the 1987 administrative reform. Under the 2010 Kallikratis plan, the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at Heraklion and is divided into four regional units (pre-Kallikratis prefectures). From west to east these are: Chania, Rethymno, Heraklion, and Lasithi. These are further subdivided into 24 municipalities.\nThe region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, Stavros Arnaoutakis, who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.\n\n\n=== Cities ===\n\nHeraklion is the largest city and capital of Crete. Chania was the capital until 1971. The principal cities are:\n\nHeraklion (Iraklion or Candia) (151,324 inhabitants)\nChania (Hani\u00e1) (53,910 inhabitants)\nRethymno (34,300 inhabitants)\nIerapetra (23,707 inhabitants)\nAgios Nikolaos (20,679 inhabitants)\nSitia (14,338 inhabitants)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\nThe economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry. The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\nAs in many regions of Greece, viticulture and olive groves are significant; oranges, citrons and avocadoes are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as mizithra, anthotyros, and kefalotyri.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.\n\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\nThe island has three significant airports, Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion, the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania and a smaller one in Sitia. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from Athens, by ferry companies such as Minoan Lines and ANEK Lines.\n\n\n==== Road Network ====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway. In addition, a European study has been devised from European Union to promote a modern highway that will connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. According to the study the project should be include 15.7 km of section of road between the villages Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete, benefits both tourists and local people by improving the accessibility to the southern part of the island and lessen the accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete's capital city Heraklion, which provides the island's airport and principal sea port link with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes. The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.  \nThe investment falls under Greece's \"Improvement of Accessibility\" Operational Programme. The programme aims to improve the country's transport infrastructures as well as its international connections. It will therefore have a key role to play in making Greece's remote and landlocked regions more accessible and economically attractive. This Operational Programme works to link Greece's more prosperous and less developed regions, which should help to promote greater territorial cohesion.\nTotal investment for the project \"Completion of construction of the section of Ag. Varvara - Ag. Deka (Kastelli) (22+170 km to 37+900 km) of the vertical road axis Irakleio \u2013 Messara in the prefecture of Irakleio, Kriti\" is EUR 102 273 321, of which the EU's European Regional Development Fund is contributing EUR 86 932 323 from the Operational Programme \"Improvement of Accessibility\" for the 2007 to 2013 programming period. Work falls under the priority \"Road Transport \u2013 trans-European and trans-regional route network of the regions on the Convergence objective\".\n\n\n==== Railway ====\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nNewspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, South Korea, Dubai Ports World and China for the construction of a large international container port and free trade zone in southern Crete near Tympaki; the plan is to expropriate 850 ha of land. The port would handle 2 million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact. As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to approve it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.\nThere are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus: EuroAfrica Interconnector and EuroAsia Interconnector. They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece, ending energy isolation of Crete. Now Hellenic Republic covers for Crete electricity costs difference of around \u20ac300 million per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Emirate of Crete, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. After a brief period of independence (1897\u20131913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\n\n\n=== Prehistoric Crete ===\n\nIn 2002, the paleontologist Gerard Gierlinski discovered fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5,600,000 years ago.The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Settlements dating to the aceramic Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC, used cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs as well as domesticated cereals and legumes; ancient Knossos was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later Minoan) sites. Other neolithic settlements include those at Kephala, Magasa, and Trapeza.\n\n\n=== Minoan civilization ===\n\nCrete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoan (c. 2700\u20131420 BC). This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as Linear A. Early Cretan history is replete with legends such as those of King Minos, Theseus and the Minotaur, passed on orally via poets such as Homer. The volcanic eruption of Thera may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization.\n\n\n=== Mycenaean civilization ===\n\nIn 1420 BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by Michael Ventris, is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425\u20131375 BC.\n\n\n=== Archaic and Classical period ===\nAfter the Bronze Age collapse, Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the Archaic period. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The Gortyn code (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified civil law established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, Gortyn, Kydonia (Chania), Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two opposing coalitions of cities. As a result, the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (Ierapetra) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\n\nCrete was involved in the Mithridatic Wars, initially repelling an attack by Roman general Marcus Antonius Creticus in 71 BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69 BC, earning for Metellus the title \"Creticus\". Gortyn was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with Cyrenaica that was called Creta et Cyrenaica. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire. In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the Panhellenion, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period ===\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica c.\u2009297. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by Vandals in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by Slavs in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In c.\u2009732, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the Pope to that of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Andalusian Arab rule ===\n\nIn the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman, and then Eastern Roman (Byzantine) island, Crete was captured by Andalusian Muladis led by Abu Hafs, who established the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, Nikephoros Phokas' campaign completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire \u2013 second period ===\n\nIn 961, Nikephoros Phokas returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon \"the Metanoeite\". The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.\nIn 1204, the Fourth Crusade seized and sacked the imperial capital of Constantinople. Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader Boniface of Montferrat in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the Republic of Venice, whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the Republic of Genoa immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.\n\n\n=== Venetian rule ===\n\nFrom 1212, during Venice's rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a Renaissance swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as The Cretan School or Post-Byzantine Art, it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter El Greco and the writers Nicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707), Georgios Kalafatis (professor) (c.\u20091652\u20131720), Andreas Musalus (c.\u20091665\u20131721) and Vitsentzos Kornaros.Under the rule of the Catholic Venetians, the city of Candia was reputed to be the best fortified city of the Eastern Mediterranean. The three main forts were located at Gramvousa, Spinalonga, and Fortezza at Rethymnon. Other fortifications include the Kazarma fortress at Sitia. In 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island. In 1574\u201377, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and Inquisitor. According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population. Marco Foscarini was the Doge of Venice during this time period.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nThe Ottomans conquered Crete in 1669, after the siege of Candia. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the Republic of Venice after the Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars, some even prospering such as the family of Simone Stratigo (c. 1733 \u2013 c. 1824) who migrated to Dalmatia from Crete in 1669. Islamic presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the Arab occupation, was cemented by the Ottoman conquest. Most Cretan Muslims were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan Greek, but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks. Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim. A number of Sufi orders were widespread throughout the island, the Bektashi order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five tekkes. Many Cretan Turks fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by Daskalogiannis, a shipowner from Sfakia who was promised support by Orlov's fleet which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the London Protocol of 1830, and soon it was yielded to Egypt by the Ottoman sultan. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the Convention of London on 3 July 1840.\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\". The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach. The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of real-estate transactions during the Ottoman rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\nThe Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869 or Great Cretan Revolution (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the Holocaust of Arkadi. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the Arkadi Monastery, which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n\n=== Cretan State 1898\u20131908 ===\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the Great Powers decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the near future.In September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, Prince George of Greece, appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898. The flag of the Cretan State was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.\n\nIn 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos \nover the question of the enosis (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the Theriso revolt, one of the leaders being Eleftherios Venizelos.\nPrince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.\nWith the break out of the First Balkan War, the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nDuring World War II, the island was the scene of the famous Battle of Crete in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and Adolf Hitler forbade further large-scale paratroop operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the Massacre of Kondomari and the Viannos massacres. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nCrete was one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion seven years ago made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece. Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back, when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.\nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and Chania and a smaller airport in Sitia (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012) or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, Rethimno, Agios Nikolaos and Sitia.\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of Chania, the Venetian castle at Rethymno, the gorge of Samaria, the islands of Chrysi, Elafonisi, Gramvousa, Spinalonga and the Palm Beach of Vai, which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in Heraklion. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.\n\n\n=== Holiday homes and immigration ===\nCrete's mild climate attracts interest from northern Europeans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. EU citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality. A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British immigrants, followed by German, Dutch, Scandinavian and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The British immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of Chania and Rethymno and to a lesser extent in Heraklion and Lasithi.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites and museums ===\n\nThe area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of Knossos, Malia (not to be confused with the town of the same name), Petras and Phaistos, the classical site of Gortys, and the diverse archaeology of the island of Koufonisi, which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to the latter has been restricted for the last few years, so it is best to check before heading to a port).\nThere are a number of museums throughout Crete. The Heraklion Archaeological Museum displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.\n\n\n=== Harmful effects ===\nHelen Briassoulis proposed in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism that Crete is a victim of external tourist systems applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of Hercules (who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all \"harmful\" and \"venomous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the Apostle Paul, who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a natural history museum, the Natural History Museum of Crete, operating under the direction of the University of Crete and two aquariums \u2013 Aquaworld in Hersonissos and Cretaquarium in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n\n==== Prehistoric fauna ====\nDwarf elephants, dwarf hippopotamus, dwarf mammoths, dwarf deer, and giant flightless owls were native to Pleistocene Crete.\n\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nMammals of Crete include the vulnerable kri-kri, Capra aegagrus cretica that can be seen in the national park of the Samaria Gorge and on Thodorou, Dia and Agioi Pantes (islets off the north coast), the Cretan wildcat and the Cretan spiny mouse. Other terrestrial mammals include subspecies of the Cretan marten, the Cretan weasel, the Cretan badger, the long-eared hedgehog, and the edible dormouse.The Cretan shrew, a type of white-toothed shrew is considered endemic to the island of Crete because this species of shrew is unknown elsewhere. It is a relic species of the crocidura shrews of which fossils have been found that can be dated to the Pleistocene era. In the present day it can only be found in the highlands of Crete. It is considered to be the only surviving remnant of the endemic species of the Pleistocene Mediterranean islands.Bat species include: Blasius's horseshoe bat, the lesser horseshoe bat, the greater horseshoe bat, the lesser mouse-eared bat, Geoffroy's bat, the whiskered bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle, the common pipistrelle, Savi's pipistrelle, the serotine bat, the long-eared bat, Schreibers' bat and the European free-tailed bat.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Birds ====\nA large variety of birds includes eagles (can be seen in Lasithi), swallows (throughout Crete in the summer and all the year in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and common cranes (including Gavdos and Gavdopoula). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered lammergeier vulture. Bird species include: the golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, the bearded vulture or lammergeier, the griffon vulture, Eleanora's falcon, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon, European kestrel, tawny owl, little owl, hooded crow, alpine chough, red-billed chough, and the Eurasian hoopoe.\n\n\n==== Reptiles and amphibians ====\nTortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.\nReptiles include the Aegean wall lizard, Balkan green lizard, common chameleon, ocellated skink, snake-eyed skink, moorish gecko, Turkish gecko, Kotschy's gecko, spur-thighed tortoise, and the Caspian turtle.There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the leopard snake (locally known as Ochendra), the Balkan whip snake (locally called Dendrogallia), the dice snake (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal cat snake which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.Sea turtles include the green turtle and the loggerhead turtle which are both threatened species. The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.Amphibians include the European green toad, American bullfrog (introduced), European tree frog, and the Cretan marsh frog (endemic).\n\n\n==== Arthropods ====\nCrete has an unusual variety of insects. Cicadas, known locally as Tzitzikia, make a distinctive repetitive tzi tzi sound that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the swallowtail butterfly. Moth species include the hummingbird moth. There are several species of scorpion such as Euscorpius carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.\n\n\n==== Crustaceans and molluscs ====\nRiver crabs include the semi-terrestrial Potamon potamios crab. Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.\n\n\n==== Sealife ====\nApart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks at present, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Apart from the famous endangered Mediterranean monk seal, which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts whales, sperm whales, dolphins and porpoises. These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. Squid and octopus can be found along the coast and sea turtles and hammerhead sharks swim in the sea around the coast. The Cretaquarium and the Aquaworld Aquarium, are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece. They are located in Gournes and Hersonissos respectively. Examples of the local sealife can be seen there.Some of the fish that can be seen in the waters around Crete include: scorpion fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the flying gurnard.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe Minoans contributed to the deforestation of Crete. Further deforestation occurred in the 1600s \"so that no more local supplies of firewood were available\".Common wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladiolus, hyacinth, iris, poppy, cyclamen and tulip, among others. There are more than 200 different species of wild orchid on the island and this includes 14 varieties of Ophrys cretica. Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Rare herbs include the endemic Cretan dittany. and ironwort, Sideritis syriaca, known as Malotira (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1). Varieties of cactus include the edible prickly pear. Common trees on the island include the chestnut, cypress, oak, olive tree, pine, plane, and tamarisk. Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Environmentally protected areas ===\nThere are a number of environmentally protected areas. One such area is located at the island of Elafonisi on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of Vai in eastern Crete and the Dionysades (both in the municipality of Sitia, Lasithi), have diverse animal and plant life. Vai has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of Chrysi, 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of Ierapetra, has the largest naturally-grown Juniperus macrocarpa forest in Europe. Samaria Gorge is a World Biosphere Reserve and Richtis Gorge is protected for its landscape diversity.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\nCrete has a strong association with Ancient Greek Gods but is also connected with the Minoan civilisation.\nAccording to Greek Mythology, The Diktaean Cave at Mount Dikti was the birthplace of the god Zeus. The Paximadia islands were the birthplace of the goddess Artemis and the god Apollo. Their mother, the goddess Leto, was worshipped at Phaistos. The goddess Athena bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of Dia. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of Lefkai were the result of a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of Souda and Leon). Heracles, in one of his labors, took the Cretan bull to the Peloponnese. Europa and Zeus made love at Gortys and conceived the kings of Crete: Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, and Minos.\nThe labyrinth of the Palace of Knossos was the setting for the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. Icarus and Daedalus were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death King Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades, while Rhadamanthys became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCrete has its own distinctive Mantinades poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based music (typically performed with the Cretan lyra and the laouto) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the Pentozali. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.Cretan authors have made important contributions to Greek literature throughout the modern period; major names include Vikentios Kornaros, creator of the 17th-century epic romance Erotokritos (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, Nikos Kazantzakis. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the Cretan School of icon painting, which influenced El Greco and through him subsequent European painting.\nCrete is also famous for its traditional cuisine. The nutritional value of the Cretan cuisine was discovered by the American epidemiologist Ancel Keys in the 1960, being later often mentioned by epidemiologists as one of the best examples of the Mediterranean diet.Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (stivania), vr\u00e1ka breeches tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (sariki). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of masculinity.\nCretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan vendettas which persist on the island to date. Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun. Guns are subject to strict regulation from the Greek government, and in recent years a great deal of effort to control firearms in Crete has been undertaken by the Greek police, but with limited success.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nCrete has many football clubs playing in the local leagues. During the 2011\u201312 season, OFI Crete, which plays at Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium (Iraklion), and Ergotelis F.C., which plays at the Pankritio Stadium (Iraklion) were both members of the Greek Superleague. During the 2012\u201313 season, OFI Crete, which plays at Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium (Iraklion), and Platanias F.C., which plays at the Perivolia Municipal Stadium, near Chania, are both members of the Greek Superleague.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nNotable people from Crete include:\n\nNikos Kazantzakis, author, born in Heraklion, 7 times suggested for the Nobel Prize\nOdysseas Elytis, poet, awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1979, born in Heraklion\nGeorgios Chortatzis, Renaissance author\nVitsentzos Kornaros, Renaissance author from Sitia, who lived in Heraklion (then Candia)\nDomenikos Theotokopoulos (El Greco), Renaissance artist, born in Heraklion\nNikos Xilouris, famous composer and singer.\nPsarantonis, Cretan folk singer and Cretan lyra player and brother of Nikos Xilouris.\nNana Mouskouri, singer, born in Chania\nEleftherios Venizelos, former Greek Prime Minister, born in Chania Prefecture\nKonstantinos Mitsotakis, nephew of Eleftherios Venizelos and Prime Minister of Greece.\nDaskalogiannis, leader of the Orlov Revolt in Crete in 1770\nMichalis Kourmoulis, leader of the Greek War of Independence from Messara.\nEleni Daniilidou, tennis player, born in Chania\nLouis Tikas, Greek-American labor union leader\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian writer, born in Heraklion\nNick Dandolos, a.k.a.

        "wiki": "Sonar (sound navigation ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name \"sonar\": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of \"targets\" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward-looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.\nThe first recorded use of the technique was by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490 who used a tube inserted into the water to detect vessels by ear. It was developed during World War I to counter the growing threat of submarine warfare, with an operational passive sonar system in use by 1918. Modern active sonar systems use an acoustic transducer to generate a sound wave which is reflected from target objects.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough some animals (dolphins, bats, some shrews, and others) have used sound for communication and object detection for millions of years, use by humans in the water is initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490: a tube inserted into the water was said to be used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube.In the late 19th century an underwater bell was used as an ancillary to lighthouses or lightships to provide warning of hazards.The use of sound to \"echo-locate\" underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation seems to have been prompted by the Titanic disaster of 1912. The world's first patent for an underwater echo-ranging device was filed at the British Patent Office by English meteorologist Lewis Fry Richardson a month after the sinking of Titanic, and a German physicist Alexander Behm obtained a patent for an echo sounder in 1913.The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden, while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston, Massachusetts, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse code) and echo ranging (detecting an iceberg at a 2-mile, 3.2 km range). The \"Fessenden oscillator\", operated at about 500 Hz frequency, was unable to determine the bearing of the iceberg due to the 3-metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer's radiating face (less than \u200b1\u20443 wavelength in diameter). The ten Montreal-built British H-class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with Fessenden oscillators.During World War I the need to detect submarines prompted more research into the use of sound. The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer Constantin Chilowsky, worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915. Although piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, this work influenced future designs. Lightweight sound-sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones, while Terfenol-D and PMN (lead magnesium niobate) have been developed for projectors.\n\n\n=== ASDIC ===\n\nIn 1916, under the British Board of Invention and Research, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A. B. Wood, producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917. This work, for the Anti-Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff, was undertaken in utmost secrecy, and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world's first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus. To maintain secrecy, no mention of sound experimentation or quartz was made \u2013 the word used to describe the early work (\"supersonics\") was changed to \"ASD\"ics, and the quartz material to \"ASD\"ivite: \"ASD\" for \"Anti-Submarine Division\", hence the British acronym ASDIC. In 1939, in response to a question from the Oxford English Dictionary, the Admiralty made up the story that it stood for \"Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee\", and this is still widely believed, though no committee bearing this name has been found in the Admiralty archives.By 1918, Britain and France had built prototype active systems. The British tested their ASDIC on HMS Antrim in 1920 and started production in 1922. The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC-equipped vessels in 1923. An anti-submarine school HMS Osprey and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924. \nBy the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hampered by the use of the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied with new tactics and new weapons.\nThe tactical improvements developed by Frederic John Walker included the creeping attack. 2 anti-submarine ships were needed for this (usually sloops or corvettes). The \"directing ship\" tracked the target submarine on ASDIC from a position about 1500 to 2000 yards behind the submarine. The second ship, with her ASDIC turned off and running at 5 knots, started an attack from a position between the directing ship and the target. This attack was controlled by radio telephone from the directing ship, based on their ASDIC and the range (by rangefinder) and bearing of the attacking ship. As soon as the depth charges had been released, the attacking ship left the immediate area at full speed. The directing ship then entered the target area and also released a pattern of depth charges. The low speed of the approach meant the submarine could not predict when depth charges were going to be released. Any evasive action was detected by the directing ship and steering orders to the attacking ship given accordingly. The low speed of the attack had the advantage that the German acoustic torpedo was not effective against a warship travelling so slowly. A variation of the creeping attack was the \"plaster\" attack, in which 3 attacking ships working in a close line abreast were directed over the target by the directing ship.The new weapons to deal with the ASDIC blind spot were \"ahead-throwing weapons\", such as Hedgehogs and later Squids, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and still in ASDIC contact. These allowed a single escort to make better aimed attacks on submarines. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets that used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used.\nEarly in World War II (September 1940), British ASDIC technology was transferred for free to the United States. Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US. Many new types of military sound detection were developed. These included sonobuoys, first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename High Tea, dipping/dunking sonar and mine-detection sonar. This work formed the basis for post-war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine.\n\n\n=== SONAR ===\nDuring the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound-detection technology, and important discoveries were made, such as the existence of thermoclines and their effects on sound waves. Americans began to use the term SONAR for their systems, coined by Frederick Hunt to be the equivalent of RADAR.\n\n\n=== US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory ===\nIn 1917, the US Navy acquired J. Warren Horton's services for the first time. On leave from Bell Labs, he served the government as a technical expert, first at the experimental station at Nahant, Massachusetts, and later at US Naval Headquarters, in London, England. At Nahant he applied the newly developed vacuum tube, then associated with the formative stages of the field of applied science now known as electronics, to the detection of underwater signals. As a result, the carbon button microphone, which had been used in earlier detection equipment, was replaced by the precursor of the modern hydrophone. Also during this period, he experimented with methods for towing detection. This was due to the increased sensitivity of his device. The principles are still used in modern towed sonar systems.\nTo meet the defense needs of Great Britain, he was sent to England to install in the Irish Sea bottom-mounted hydrophones connected to a shore listening post by submarine cable. While this equipment was being loaded on the cable-laying vessel, World War I ended and Horton returned home.\nDuring World War II, he continued to develop sonar systems that could detect submarines, mines, and torpedoes. He published Fundamentals of Sonar in 1957 as chief research consultant at the US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory. He held this position until 1959 when he became technical director, a position he held until mandatory retirement in 1963.\n\n\n=== Materials and designs in the US and Japan ===\nThere was little progress in US sonar from 1915 to 1940. In 1940, US sonars typically consisted of a magnetostrictive transducer and an array of nickel tubes connected to a 1-foot-diameter steel plate attached back-to-back to a Rochelle salt crystal in a spherical housing. This assembly penetrated the ship hull and was manually rotated to the desired angle. The piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystal had better parameters, but the magnetostrictive unit was much more reliable. High losses to US merchant supply shipping early in World War II led to large scale high priority US research in the field, pursuing both improvements in magnetostrictive transducer parameters and Rochelle salt reliability. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), a superior alternative, was found as a replacement for Rochelle salt; the first application was a replacement of the 24 kHz Rochelle-salt transducers. Within nine months, Rochelle salt was obsolete. The ADP manufacturing facility grew from few dozen personnel in early 1940 to several thousands in 1942.\nOne of the earliest application of ADP crystals were hydrophones for acoustic mines; the crystals were specified for low-frequency cutoff at 5 Hz, withstanding mechanical shock for deployment from aircraft from 3,000 m (10,000 ft), and ability to survive neighbouring mine explosions. One of key features of ADP reliability is its zero aging characteristics; the crystal keeps its parameters even over prolonged storage.\nAnother application was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were mounted on the torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar \u2013 a transducer was added to the torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.\nPassive sonar arrays for submarines were developed from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were arranged in a steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays.\nThe standard US Navy scanning sonar at the end of World War II operated at 18 kHz, using an array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5 kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and \"expendable modular design\", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.The Imperial Japanese Navy at the onset of World War II used projectors based on quartz. These were big and heavy, especially if designed for lower frequencies; the one for Type 91 set, operating at 9 kHz, had a diameter of 30 inches (760 mm) and was driven by an oscillator with 5 kW power and 7 kV of output amplitude. The Type 93 projectors consisted of solid sandwiches of quartz, assembled into spherical cast iron bodies. The Type 93 sonars were later replaced with Type 3, which followed German design and used magnetostrictive projectors; the projectors consisted of two rectangular identical independent units in a cast iron rectangular body about 16 by 9 inches (410 mm \u00d7 230 mm). The exposed area was half the wavelength wide and three wavelengths high. The magnetostrictive cores were made from 4 mm stampings of nickel, and later of an iron-aluminium alloy with aluminium content between 12.7% and 12.9%. The power was provided from a 2 kW at 3.8 kV, with polarization from a 20 V, 8 A DC source.\nThe passive hydrophones of the Imperial Japanese Navy were based on moving-coil design, Rochelle salt piezo transducers, and carbon microphones.\n\n\n=== Later developments in transducers ===\nMagnetostrictive transducers were pursued after World War II as an alternative to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to 13 feet (4.0 m) in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by prestressing. Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent of these improved magnetostrictive materials is Galfenol.\nOther types of transducers include variable-reluctance (or moving-armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on the surfaces of gaps, and moving coil (or electrodynamic) transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.\n\n\n== Active sonar ==\n\nActive sonar uses a sound transmitter (or projector) and a receiver. When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation.  When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation.  When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation.  Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically.\nActive sonar creates a pulse of sound, often called a \"ping\", and then listens for reflections (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals (\"pings\"). A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. chemically using explosives,  airguns or  plasma sound sources.\nTo measure the distance to an object, the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range using the known speed of sound. To measure the bearing, several hydrophones are used, and the set measures the relative arrival time to each, or with an array of hydrophones, by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called beamforming. Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multibeam systems are used. The target signal (if present) together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal processing, which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement.  It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise. This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display, or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software. Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it, as well as measuring its velocity.\nThe pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency (to allow pulse compression on reception). Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique. Since digital processing became available pulse compression has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques.  Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all-round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc, although the beam may be rotated, relatively slowly, by mechanical scanning.\nParticularly when single frequency transmissions are used, the Doppler effect can be used to measure the radial speed of a target.  The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity. Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion, allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform.\nOne useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight. The head is pointed into the water, a button is pressed, and the device displays the distance to the target. Another variant is a \"fishfinder\" that shows a small display with shoals of fish. Some civilian sonars (which are not designed for stealth) approach active military sonars in capability, with three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat.\nWhen active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom, it is known as echo sounding. Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement.\nActive sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.\nIn combat situations, an active pulse can be detected by an enemy and will reveal a submarine's position at twice the maximum distance that the submarine can itself detect a contact and give clues as to the submarines identity based on the characteristics of the outgoing ping. For these reasons, active sonar is not frequently used by military submarines.\nA very directional, but low-efficiency, type of sonar (used by fisheries, military, and for port security) makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non-linear sonar, the virtual transducer being known as a parametric array.\n\n\n=== Project Artemis ===\nProject Artemis was an experimental research and development project in the late 1950s to mid 1960s to examine acoustic propagation and signal processing for a low-frequency active sonar system that might be used for ocean surveillance. A secondary objective was examination of engineering problems of fixed active bottom systems. The receiving array was located on the slope of Plantagnet Bank off Bermuda. The active source array was deployed from the converted World War II tanker USNS Mission Capistrano. Elements of Artemis were used experimentally after the main experiment was terminated.\n\n\n=== Transponder ===\nThis is an active sonar device that receives a specific stimulus and immediately (or with a delay) retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one. Transponders can be used to remotely activate or recover subsea equipment.\n\n\n=== Performance prediction ===\nA sonar target is small relative to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, the power of the reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000 W/m2 signal at 1 m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m2 signal. At 100 m the signal will be 1 W/m2 (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m2 target, it will be at 0.001 W/m2 when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001 W/m2 until 3000 m. Any 10 m2 target between 100 and 3000 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse, but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes. Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example).\nActive sonar have two performance limitations: due to noise and reverberation.  In general, one or other of these will dominate, so that the two effects can be initially considered separately.\nIn noise-limited conditions at initial detection:\nSL \u2212 2PL + TS \u2212 (NL \u2212 AG) = DT,where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss (sometimes referred to as transmission loss), TS is the target strength, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain of the receiving array (sometimes approximated by its directivity index) and DT is the detection threshold.\nIn reverberation-limited conditions at initial detection (neglecting array gain):\n\nSL \u2212 2PL + TS = RL + DT,where RL is the reverberation level, and the other factors are as before.\n\n\n=== Hand-held sonar for use by a diver ===\nThe LIMIS (limpet mine imaging sonar) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar for use by a diver. Its name is because it was designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.\nThe LUIS (lensing underwater imaging system) is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.\nThere is or was a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers, that merely displays range.\nFor the INSS (integrated navigation sonar system)\n\n\n== Passive sonar ==\nPassive sonar listens without transmitting. It is often employed in military settings, although it is also used in science applications, e.g., detecting fish for presence/absence studies in various aquatic environments \u2013 see also passive acoustics and passive radar. In the very broadest usage, this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound, though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment.\n\n\n=== Identifying sound sources ===\nPassive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound. For example, U.S. vessels usually operate 60 Hz alternating current power systems. If transformers or generators are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull or become flooded, the 60 Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the submarine or ship. This can help to identify its nationality, as all European submarines and nearly every other nation's submarine have 50 Hz power systems. Intermittent sound sources (such as a wrench being dropped), called \"transients,\" may also be detectable to passive sonar. Until fairly recently, an experienced, trained operator identified signals, but now computers may do this.\nPassive sonar systems may have large sonic databases, but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually. A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e. the speed of a ship, or the type of weapon released), and even particular ships.\n\n\n=== Noise limitations ===\nPassive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.\nThe sonar hydrophones may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself. Towed units also combat the thermocline, as the unit may be towed above or below the thermocline.\nThe display of most passive sonars used to be a two-dimensional waterfall display. The horizontal direction of the display is bearing. The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays.\n\n\n=== Performance prediction ===\nUnlike active sonar, only one-way propagation is involved.  Because of the different signal processing used, the minimal detectable signal-to-noise ratio will be different.  The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar is\nSL \u2212 PL = NL \u2212 AG + DT,where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain and DT is the detection threshold.  The figure of merit of a passive sonar is\n\nFOM = SL + AG \u2212 (NL + DT).\n\n\n== Performance factors ==\nThe detection, classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment, as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar.\n\n\n=== Sound propagation ===\nSonar operation is affected by variations in sound speed, particularly in the vertical plane. Sound travels more slowly in fresh water than in sea water, though the difference is small.  The speed is determined by the water's bulk modulus and mass density.  The bulk modulus is affected by temperature, dissolved impurities (usually salinity), and pressure. The density effect is small.  The speed of sound (in feet per second) is approximately:\n\n4388 + (11.25 \u00d7 temperature (in \u00b0F)) + (0.0182 \u00d7 depth (in feet)) + salinity (in parts-per-thousand ).This empirically derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths. Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make up the rest of the ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.\nIf the sound source is deep and the conditions are right, propagation may occur in the 'deep sound channel'. This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel.  This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries.  Similar propagation can occur in the 'surface duct' under suitable conditions.  However, in this case there are reflection losses at the surface.\nIn shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom, where considerable losses can occur.\nSound propagation is affected by absorption in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom.  This absorption depends upon frequency, with several different mechanisms in sea water.  Long-range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects.\nThe sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature.  The main noise sources are waves and shipping.  The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed-dependent low frequency noise.\n\n\n=== Scattering ===\n\nWhen active sonar is used, scattering occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface.  This can be a major source of interference. This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car's headlights in fog: a high-intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent, but broader-beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions, much of which is scattered back to the observer, overwhelming that reflected from the target (\"white-out\").  For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimize scattering.\n\n \nThe scattering of sonar from objects (mines, pipelines, zooplankton, geological features, fish etc.) is how active sonar detects them, but this ability can be masked by strong scattering from false targets, or 'clutter'. Where they occur (under breaking waves; in ship wakes; in gas emitted from seabed seeps and leaks etc.), gas bubbles are powerful sources of clutter, and can readily hide targets. TWIPS (Twin Inverted Pulse Sonar) is currently the only sonar that can overcome this clutter problem. This is important as many recent conflicts have occurred in coastal waters, and the inability to detect whether mines are present or not present hazards and delays to military vessels, and also to aid convoys and merchant shipping trying to support the region long after the conflict has ceased.\n\n\n=== Target characteristics ===\nThe sound reflection characteristics of the target of an active sonar, such as a submarine, are known as its target strength.  A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales, wakes, schools of fish and rocks.\nPassive sonar detects the target's radiated noise characteristics.  The radiated spectrum comprises a continuous spectrum of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification.\n\n\n=== Countermeasures ===\nActive (powered) countermeasures may be launched by a submarine under attack to raise the noise level, provide a large false target, and obscure the signature of the submarine itself.\nPassive (i.e., non-powered) countermeasures include:\n\nMounting noise-generating devices on isolating devices.\nSound-absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines, for example anechoic tiles.\n\n\n== Military applications ==\nModern naval warfare makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.\nThe use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.\nSince active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.\nPassive sonar has several advantages, most importantly that it is silent. If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending on the level of noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar \"sees\" around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270\u00b0, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160\u00b0 on each side, and the towed array of a full 360\u00b0. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or ACINT.\nAnother use of passive sonar is to determine the target's trajectory. This process is called target motion analysis (TMA), and the resultant \"solution\" is the target's range, course, and speed. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases.\nPassive sonar is stealthy and very useful. However, it requires high-tech electronic components and is costly. It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection. Surface ships use it to good effect; it is even better used by submarines, and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters, mostly to a \"surprise effect\", since submarines can hide under thermal layers. If a submarine's commander believes he is alone, he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect, or go deeper and faster, and thus make more sound.\nExamples of sonar applications in military use are given below.  Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use.\n\n\n=== Anti-submarine warfare ===\n\nUntil recently, ship sonars were usually with hull mounted arrays, either amidships or at the bow.  It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required.  The first were made of canvas on a framework, then steel ones were used.  Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber.  Such sonars are primarily active in operation.  An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the SQS-56.\nBecause of the problems of ship noise, towed sonars are also used.  These also have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water.  However, there are limitations on their use in shallow water.  These are called towed arrays (linear) or variable depth sonars (VDS) with 2/3D arrays.  A problem is that the winches required to deploy/recover these are large and expensive.  VDS sets are primarily active in operation while towed arrays are passive.\nAn example of a modern active-passive ship towed sonar is Sonar 2087 made by Thales Underwater Systems.\n\n\n=== Torpedoes ===\nModern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active/passive sonar.  This may be used to home directly on the target, but wake homing torpedoes are also used.  An early example of an acoustic homer was the Mark 37 torpedo.\nTorpedo countermeasures can be towed or free.  An early example was the German Sieglinde device while the Bold was a chemical device.  A widely used US device was the towed AN/SLQ-25 Nixie while the mobile submarine simulator (MOSS) was a free device. A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system.\n\n\n=== Mines ===\nMines may be fitted with a sonar to detect, localize and recognize the required target.  An example is the CAPTOR mine.\n\n\n=== Mine countermeasures ===\nMine countermeasure (MCM) sonar, sometimes called \"mine and obstacle avoidance sonar (MOAS)\", is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects.  Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design.  An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the Type 2193 while the SQQ-32 mine-hunting sonar and Type 2093 systems are VDS designs.\n\n\n=== Submarine navigation ===\n\nSubmarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar at depth.  The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed.  Information fitted on typical fits is given in Oyashio-class submarine and Swiftsure-class submarine.\n\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n\nHelicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active-passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping sonar, such as the AQS-13.  Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy sonobuoys and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them.  Processing from the sonobuoys or dipping sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship.  Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions. Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS-20A.\n\n\n=== Underwater communications ===\nDedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication.\n\n\n=== Ocean surveillance ===\nThe United States began a system of passive, fixed ocean surveillance systems in 1950 with the classified name Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) with American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), with its Bell Laboratories research and Western Electric manufacturing entities being contracted for development and installation. The systems exploited the deep sound (SOFAR) channel and were based on an AT&T sound spectrograph, which converted sound into a visual spectrogram representing a time\u2013frequency analysis of sound that was developed for speech analysis and modified to analyze low-frequency underwater sounds. That process was Low Frequency Analysis and Recording and the equipment was termed the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder, both with the acronym LOFAR. LOFAR research was termed Jezebel and led to usage in air and surface systems, particularly sonobuys using the process and sometimes using \"Jezebel\" in their name. The proposed system offered such promise of long-range submarine detection that the Navy ordered immediate moves for implementation.\n\nBetween installation of a test array followed by a full scale, forty element, prototype operational array in 1951 and 1958 systems were installed in the Atlantic and then the Pacific under the unclassified name Project Caesar. The original systems were terminated at classified shore stations designated Naval Facility (NAVFAC) explained as engaging in \"ocean research\" to cover their classified mission. The system was upgraded multiple times with more advanced cable allowing the arrays to be installed in ocean basins and upgraded processing. The shore stations were eliminated in a process of consolidation and rerouting the arrays to central processing centers into the 1990s. In 1985, with new mobile arrays and other systems becoming operational the collective system name was changed to Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). In 1991 the mission of the system was declassified. The year before IUSS insignia were authorized for wear. Access was granted to some systems for scientific research.A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union.  \n\n\n=== Underwater security ===\n\nSonar can be used to detect frogmen and other scuba divers.  This can be applicable around ships or at entrances to ports.  Active sonar can also be used as a deterrent and/or disablement mechanism.  One such device is the Cerberus system.\n\n\n=== Hand-held sonar ===\n\nLimpet mine imaging sonar (LIMIS) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.\nThe LUIS is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.\nIntegrated navigation sonar system (INSS) is a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers that displays range.\n\n\n=== Intercept sonar ===\nThis is a sonar designed to detect and locate the transmissions from hostile active sonars.  An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British Vanguard-class submarines.\n\n\n== Civilian applications ==\n\n\n=== Fisheries ===\nFishing is an important industry that is seeing growing demand, but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems. The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of sustainability can be reached. However, the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors, sounders and sonars.  Historically, fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish. However, acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries.\nSound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.\n\nCompanies such as eSonar, Raymarine, Marport Canada, Wesmar, Furuno, Krupp, and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry. For example, net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel. Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function. Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone. The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor.\n\n\n=== Echo sounding ===\n\nEcho sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.The value of underwater acoustics to the fishing industry has led to the development of other acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo-sounders but, because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo-sounder, have been given different terms.\n\n\n=== Net location ===\nThe net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable-less net-sounder \u2013 such as Marport's Trawl Explorer \u2013 in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver-hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.\nThe display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.\nModern versions of the net sounder, using multiple element transducers, function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used.\nThe sonar is an echo-sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel.\n\n\n=== ROV and UUV ===\nSmall sonars have been fitted to remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) to allow their operation in murky conditions.  These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle.  The Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System is a UUV for MCM purposes.\n\n\n=== Vehicle location ===\nSonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea.  Short and long baseline sonars may be used for caring out the location, such as LBL.\n\n\n=== Prosthesis for the visually impaired ===\nIn 2013 an inventor in the United States unveiled a \"spider-sense\" bodysuit, equipped with ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback systems, which alerts the wearer of incoming threats; allowing them to respond to attackers even when blindfolded.\n\n\n== Scientific applications ==\n\n\n=== Biomass estimation ===\n\nDetection of fish, and other marine and aquatic life, and estimation their individual sizes or total biomass using active sonar techniques.  As the sound pulse travels through water it encounters objects that are of different density or acoustic characteristics than the surrounding medium, such as fish, that reflect sound back toward the sound source. These echoes provide information on fish size, location, abundance and behavior.  Data is usually processed and analysed using a variety of software such as Echoview.\n\n\n=== Wave measurement ===\nAn upward looking echo sounder mounted on the bottom or on a platform may be used to make measurements of wave height and period.  From this statistics of the surface conditions at a location can be derived.\n\n\n=== Water velocity measurement ===\nSpecial short range sonars have been developed to allow measurements of water velocity.\n\n\n=== Bottom type assessment ===\nSonars have been developed that can be used to characterise the sea bottom into, for example, mud, sand, and gravel. Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add-on modules, converting echo parameters into sediment type. Different algorithms exist, but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings.  Advanced substrate classification analysis can be achieved using calibrated (scientific) echosounders and parametric or fuzzy-logic analysis of the acoustic data.\n\n\n=== Bathymetric mapping ===\n\nSide-scan sonars can be used to derive maps of seafloor topography (bathymetry) by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom. Low frequency sonars such as GLORIA have been used for continental shelf wide surveys while high frequency sonars are used for more detailed surveys of smaller areas.\n\n\n=== Sub-bottom profiling ===\nPowerful low frequency echo-sounders have been developed for providing profiles of the upper layers of the ocean bottom.\n\n\n=== Gas leak detection from the seabed ===\nGas bubbles can leak from the seabed, or close to it, from multiple sources. These can be detected by both passive and active sonar (shown in schematic figure by yellow and red systems respectively). Natural seeps of methane and carbon dioxide occur. Gas pipelines can leak, and it is important to be able to detect whether leakage occurs from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities (CCSFs; e.g. depleted oil wells into which extracted atmospheric carbon is stored). Quantification of the amount of gas leaking is difficult, and although estimates can be made use active and passive sonar, it is important to question their accuracy because of the assumptions inherent in making such estimations from sonar data.\n\n\n=== Synthetic aperture sonar ===\nVarious synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine-hunting and search systems.  An explanation of their operation is given in synthetic aperture sonar.\n\n\n=== Parametric sonar ===\nParametric sources use the non-linearity of water to generate the difference frequency between two high frequencies.  A virtual end-fire array is formed. Such a projector has advantages of broad bandwidth, narrow beamwidth, and when fully developed and carefully measured it has no obvious sidelobes: see Parametric array. Its major disadvantage is very low efficiency of only a few percent.  P.J. Westervelt summarizes the trends involved.\n\n\n=== Sonar in extraterrestrial contexts ===\nUse of both passive and active sonar has been proposed for various extraterrestrial uses,. An example of the use of active sonar is in determining the depth of hydrocarbon seas on Titan, An example of the use of passive sonar is in the detection of methanefalls on Titan,It has been noted that those proposals which suggest use of sonar without taking proper account of the difference between the Earthly (atmosphere, ocean, mineral) environments and the extraterrestrial ones, can lead to erroneous values\n\n\n== Effect of sonar on marine life ==\n\n\n=== Effect on marine mammals ===\n\nResearch has shown that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals. Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, have been shown to be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar. Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar, while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins. The US Navy, which part-funded some of the studies, said that the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but they \"will evaluate the effectiveness of [their] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings\". A 2008 US Supreme Court ruling on the use of sonar by the US Navy noted that there had been no cases where sonar had been conclusively shown to have harmed or killed a marine mammal.Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation systems, sometimes called biosonar to locate predators and prey. Research on the effects of sonar on blue whales in the Southern California Bight shows that mid-frequency sonar use disrupts the whales' feeding behavior. This indicates that sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on baleen whale foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health.A review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used was published in 2019. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier's beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations. The review suggested the strength of response of individual animals may depend on whether they had prior exposure to sonar, and that symptoms of decompression sickness have been found in stranded whales that may be a result of such response to sonar.  It noted that in the Canary Islands where multiple strandings had been previously reported, no more mass strandings had occurred once naval exercises during which sonar was used were banned in the area, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur.\n\n\n=== Effect on fish ===\nHigh-intensity sonar sounds can create a small temporary shift in the hearing threshold of some fish.\n\n\n== Frequencies and resolutions ==\nThe frequencies of sonars range from infrasonic to above a megahertz. Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher frequencies offer better resolution, and smaller size for a given directionality.\nTo achieve reasonable directionality, frequencies below 1 kHz generally require large size, usually achieved as towed arrays.Low frequency sonars are loosely defined as 1\u20135 kHz, albeit some navies regard 5\u20137 kHz also as low frequency. Medium frequency is defined as 5\u201315 kHz. Another style of division considers low frequency to be under 1 kHz, and medium frequency at between 1\u201310 kHz.American World War II era sonars operated at a relatively high frequency of 20\u201330 kHz, to achieve directionality with reasonably small transducers, with typical maximum operational range of 2500 yd. Postwar sonars used lower frequencies to achieve longer range; e.g. SQS-4 operated at 10 kHz with range up to 5000 yd. SQS-26 and SQS-53 operated at 3 kHz with range up to 20,000 yd; their domes had size of approx. a 60-ft personnel boat, an upper size limit for conventional hull sonars. Achieving larger sizes by conformal sonar array spread over the hull has not been effective so far, for lower frequencies linear or towed arrays are therefore used.Japanese WW2 sonars operated at a range of frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9 kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5 kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19 kHz magnetostrictive) at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6 km. The later Type 3, with German-design magnetostrictive transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20 kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except model 1 which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The simple type used 14.5 kHz magnetostrictive transducers at 0.25 kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5 km.The sonar's resolution is angular; objects further apart are imaged with lower resolutions than nearby ones.\nAnother source lists ranges and resolutions vs frequencies for sidescan sonars. 30 kHz provides low resolution with range of 1000\u20136000 m, 100 kHz gives medium resolution at 500\u20131000 m, 300 kHz gives high resolution at 150\u2013500 m, and 600 kHz gives high resolution at 75\u2013150 m. Longer range sonars are more adversely affected by nonhomogenities of water. Some environments, typically shallow waters near the coasts, have complicated terrain with many features; higher frequencies become necessary there.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDring, Thomas R.

        "wiki": "The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is a museum located in Heraklion on Crete. It is one of the greatest museums in Greece and the best in the world for Minoan art, as it contains the most notable and complete collection of artefacts of the Minoan civilization of Crete.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe museum began in 1883 as a simple collection of antiquities. A dedicated building was constructed from 1904 to 1912 at the instigation of two Cretan archaeologists, Iosif Hatzidakis and Stefanos Xanthoudidis. After three destructive earthquakes in 1926, 1930, and 1935, the museum nearly collapsed. The director of the Heraklion Museum was then Spyridon Marinatos, who made great efforts to find funds and persuade the locals and the central government alike that a new solid building was needed. In 1935, Marinatos succeeded in engaging Patroklos Karantinos to build a sturdy structure that has withstood both natural disasters and the bombing that accompanied the German invasion in 1941. Although the museum was damaged during World War II, the collection survived intact and again became accessible to the public in 1952. A new wing was added in 1964.\nThe Herakleion Archaeological Museum is one of the largest and most important museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. It houses representative artifacts from all the periods of Cretan prehistory and history, covering a chronological span of over 5,500 years from the Neolithic period to Roman times. The singularly important Minoan collection contains unique examples of Minoan art, many of them true masterpieces. The Heraklion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.\nThe museum is located in the town centre. It was built between 1937 and 1940 by architect Patroklos Karantinos on a site previously occupied by the Roman Catholic monastery of Saint-Francis which was destroyed by earthquake in 1856. The museum's antiseismic building is an important example of modernist architecture and was awarded a Bauhaus commendation. Karantinos applied the principles of modern architecture to the specific needs of a museum by providing good lighting from the skylights above and along the top of the walls, and facilitating the easy flow of large groups of people. He also anticipated future extensions to the museum. The colours and construction materials, such as the veined polychrome marbles, recall certain Minoan wall-paintings which imitate marble revetment. The two-storeyed building has large exhibition spaces, laboratories, a drawing room, a library, offices and a special department, the so-called Scientific Collection, where numerous finds are stored and studied. The museum shop, run by the Archaeological Receipts Fund, sells museum copies, books, postcards and slides. There is also a caf\u00e9.\nMost of the museum was closed for renovation from 2006 and reopened in May 2013.The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is a Special Regional Service of the Ministry of Culture and its purpose is to acquire, safeguard, conserve, record, study, publish, display and promote Cretan artefacts from the Prehistoric to the Late Roman periods. The museum organizes temporary exhibitions in Greece and abroad, collaborates with scientific and scholarly institutions, and houses a variety of cultural events.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Room I ===\nCovers findings from 6000 BCE to the pre-Palatial period, including:\n\nNeolithic fertility goddess\nVasiliki ware\nstone jars from the island of Mochlos\nminiature clay sculptures\n\n\n=== Room II ===\nCovers findings from 2000 BCE to 1700 BCE in Knossos, Malia and several peak sanctuaries, including:\n\nKamares ware pottery\nglazed plaques of Minoan houses (aka the \"Town Mosaic\")\npeak sanctuary figurines\n\n\n=== Room III ===\nPhaistos Disc\nKamares ware pottery\n\n\n=== Room IV ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1450 BCE, including:\n\nbull's head rhyton from Knossos\nsnake goddess figurines\ntools and weapons, mostly cast in bronze\ncups with Linear A inscriptions\n\n\n=== Room V ===\nCovers findings from 1450 BCE to 1400 BCE, including:\n\nancient Egyptian trade objects\nclay model of a house\nexamples of a Linear A and Linear B scripts\n\n\n=== Room VI ===\nCovers findings from cemeteries at Knossos, Phaistos and Archanes, including:\n\nclay figurines\ngold jewellery\nhorse burial from a tholos tomb at Archanes\n\n\n=== Room VII ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1300 BCE from smaller villas and sacred caves, including:\n\nbronze double axes\nthe \"Harvesters Vase\"\nsteatite vases from Hagia Triada\ngold jewelry from Malia\n\n\n=== Room VIII \u2013 Zakros ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1450 BCE from the palace of Zakros, including:\n\nrock crystal rhyton\nbull's head rhyton\npottery with floral and marine motifs\n\n\n=== Room IX ===\nCovers findings from 1700 BCE to 1450 BCE in eastern Crete, including:\n\nterracotta figurines from Pisokephalo peak sanctuary\nseal stones\n\n\n=== Room X \u2013 Mycenaean ===\nCovers findings from 1400 BCE to 1100 BCE, including:\n\nclay figurines\nclay sculpture of dancers with a lyre player\n\n\n=== Room XI \u2013 Dorian ===\nCovers findings from 1100 BCE to 900 BCE during the arrival of the Dorian Greeks, including:\n\nweapons and tools, mostly of iron\nclay fertility figurines\nvotive offerings\n\n\n=== Room XII ===\nCovers findings up to 650 BCE, including:\n\npottery decorated with griffins\nartefacts and figurines from Kato Syme\n\n\n=== Room XIII \u2013 Larnakes ===\nMinoan larnakes (clay coffins) are on display here.\n\n\n=== Room XIV \u2013 Hall of the Frescoes ===\nFrescoes from Knossos and Hagia Triada\nThe Hagia Triada sarcophagus\n\n\n=== Room XV & Room XVI ===\nMore frescoes, including the famous \"La Parisienne\"\n\n\n=== Room XX \u2013 Classical Greek, Greco-Roman ===\nSculptures from Classical Greek and Greco-Roman periods\n\n\n== Visitor information ==\nThe museum is open April\u2013September, Monday 12\u20137pm Tuesday\u2013Sunday 8am\u20137pm, October\u2013March daily 8am\u20135pm.\nEU students can receive a discounted entry.\nThere is air conditioning within the building.\nSome of the collection cannot be photographed due to publication or another reason.

        "wiki": "Heraklion or Iraklion ( hih-RAK-lee-\u0259n; Greek: \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio, pronounced [i\u02c8raklio]) is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669. \nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0647) was the capital of Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898\u20131908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time, the city was renamed \"Heraklion\", after the Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles' city\"), whose exact location is unknown.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.\n\n\n== Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications ==\n\nVenetian constructions such as the Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain (in Lions Square).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenosThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 65th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 7.974.887 travellers in 2018 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nIn April 2018, the inner space of the airport has been modernized and expanded by almost 3.000 s.m., with 11 new gates and new stores. The expansion was a donation by Hellenic Duty Free Shops.\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\nA project for the new airport of Heraklion in Kasteli area is starting at the end of 2017.\n\n\n=== Highway network ===\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nUrban buses serving the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connects Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nFrom 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nA study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility of two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\n=== Famous natives ===\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nElli Alexiou (1894\u20131988) author\nMin\u00e1s Dim\u00e1kis (1913\u20131980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911\u20131996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (1947\u2013present) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749\u20131798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883\u20131957) author\nPedro de Candia, (1485\u20131542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330-after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922\u20131998) author\n\n\n==== Scientists and scholars ====\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccol\u00f2 Comneno Papadopoli (1655\u20131740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (ca. 1665\u20131721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537\u20131604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933\u2013present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470\u20131517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946\u2013present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

It is the fourth largest city in Greece with a population of 211,370 (Urban Area) according to the 2011 census. The population of the municipality was 173,993.The Bronze Age palace of Knossos, also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the Planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Arab traders from al-Andalus (Iberia) who founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642\u200e, \"Castle of the Moat\") in the 820s. This was hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be (Ch\u00e1ndax) or \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (Ch\u00e1ndakas) and Latinized as Candia, which was taken into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in French as Candie, in English as Candy, all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name was Kandiye.\nAfter the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, \"castle-dwellers\").\nThe ancient name \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd was revived in the 19th century and comes from the nearby Roman port of Heracleum (\"Heracles's city\"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations \"Heraklion\" or \"Heraclion\", but the form \"Iraklion\" is becoming more common.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Minoan Era ===\nHeraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, which in Minoan times was the largest centre of population on Crete. Knossos had a port at the site of Heraklion (at Poros - Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC). Between 1600 and 1525 BC, the port was destroyed by a volcanic tsunami from nearby Santorini, leveling the region and covering it with ash.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area was abound with pirates and bandits.\n\n\n=== Emirate of Crete ===\nThe present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the Arabs under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rab\u1e0d al-\u1e2bandaq (\u0631\u0628\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0642, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as \u03a7\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03be, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (ca. 827\u2013961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era ===\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\n=== Venetian era ===\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645\u20131669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished.

No approval has yet been given for this proposal.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHeraklion has a hot-summer-Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 \u00b0C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 6 \u00b0C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.2 \u00b0C\nA new temperature record for February was set at 27.8 \u00b0C, reached on 15 February 2016.\n\n\n== Colleges, universities, libraries, and research centers ==\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)  (Former TEI)\n MBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051225/http://www.heraklion.gr/en/municipality/vikelaia\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nLychnostatis Open Air Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe city is home to several sports clubs.

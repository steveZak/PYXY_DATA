        "wiki": "West Edmonton Mall (WEM), located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, is the largest shopping mall in North America, followed by American Dream Meadowlands in New Jersey. It is the most visited mall in Canada, followed by Metrotown Mall in Burnaby, and the 23rd largest in the world (along with The Dubai Mall) by gross leasable area. It was the world's largest mall until 2004. The mall was founded by the Ghermezian brothers, who emigrated from Iran in 1959. Its major anchors include Hudson's Bay, London Drugs, La Maison Simons, The Brick, and Winners/HomeSense.\nWest Edmonton Mall covers a gross area of about 490,000 m2 (5,300,000 sq ft). There are over 800 stores and services including nine attractions, two hotels and over 100 dining venues in the complex, and parking for more than 20,000 vehicles. More than 24,000 people are employed at the property. The mall receives about 32 million visitors per year; it attracts between 90,000 and 200,000 shoppers daily, depending on the day and season. The mall was valued at $926 million in January 2007, and in 2016, for tax purposes, it was valued at $1.3034 billion, making it the most valuable property in Edmonton.\n\n\n== History ==\nWest Edmonton Mall first opened its doors to the public on 15 September 1981. The mall was developed in four phases, completed in 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1999. It was the largest indoor shopping centre in the world until 2004, and was named such in the Guinness Book of Records. The four phases of construction are used in a colour-coded system as a guideline for finding stores and attractions.\nThe Mindbender indoor roller coaster had a fatal accident on 14 June 1986 when one of the rear cars derailed from the track and slammed into a nearby concrete pillar. Three people died and one was injured in the accident.\n\nOn 11 July 2004, the mall suffered millions of dollars in damage when a severe storm of hail and rain caused roofs to fail and drains to overflow. The Ice Palace and surrounding sections were the most damaged, and the World Waterpark had a sewage overflow. The damage was promptly repaired.\n\n\n=== Former tenants ===\nSears Canada (closed 8 January 2018, was replaced by a now-closed West 49 outlet on the Main level and Stitches Factory Outlet on the Upper level.

It is an indoor amusement park located on the north side of the mall. It is the second-largest indoor amusement park in the world, behind Ferrari World, and features 24 rides and attractions. There are 8 beginner rides, 9 intermediate rides, 7 thrill rides, the triple loop Mindbender roller coaster, the world's largest indoor triple loop roller coaster. The latest attraction in Galaxyland, which opened in 2018, named HAVOC. The Drop of Doom was shut down in the early 2000s. The tower area was replaced shortly after by a more modern launch ride, the Space Shot, a S&S Double Shot Tower Ride.\n\n\n=== World Waterpark ===\n\nThe World Waterpark is the world's second largest indoor waterpark, built in 1985, with a size of 20,903 square metres (5.165 acres). The park has the world's largest indoor wave pool.

The Edmonton Oilers occasionally practised at the Ice Palace during the 1980s. The Oilers' contract for using the rink has since expired. The rink is used for various hockey and other sporting tournaments. In 2015, the Ice Palace was renamed Mayfield Toyota Ice Palace after the mall sold the naming rights to a local auto dealership.During special events, such as Remembrance Day, the ice rink is covered for ceremonies. In 2017, West Edmonton Mall announced that the Mayfield Toyota Ice Palace would get a $3 million renovation. Due to this, it was closed for the summer and reopened in December 2017.\n\n\n=== Professor WEM's Adventure Golf ===\n\nProfessor WEM's Adventure Golf is an 18-hole miniature golf course. The miniature golf course was originally known as Pebble Beach Mini Golf, and was designed to be a mini golf version of Pebble Beach Golf Links. The course was refurbished and given the Professor WEM theme in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n=== Other attractions ===\n\nFantasyland Hotel, located within the mall; WEM is also affiliated with a second hotel, the West Edmonton Mall Inn, located across the street from the shopping centre on 90th Avenue.\nAn indoor shooting range (named \"Wild West Shooting Centre\")\nLarge-scale replica of the Santa Mar\u00eda, one of the ships sailed by Christopher Columbus in 1492 to San Salvador Island.

The former Edmonton Events Centre space has been purchased by Gateway Casinos & Entertainment for their expansion of the Palace Casino, which was renamed to Starlight Casino.\nEnvy Nightclub (formerly SET Nightclub), a dance club featuring top 40 and electro music.

Several restaurants and clubs are located here including 1ST RND, Boston Pizza, Earl's, Hudson's Canadian Tap House, Jungle Jim's Eatery, Marble Slab Creamery, Moxie's Classic Grill, MR MIKES Steakhouse & Bar, Rick Bronson's The Comic Strip, Sherlock Holmes Pub, Aussie Rules, Cajun Bistro and Dueling Piano Bar, and Tony Roma's. The lighting in this area is left intentionally dim to simulate a nighttime atmosphere. The area is situated in such a way that it can be closed off from the rest of the mall, allowing for hosting of special events, and for its establishments to stay open past the closing time of the rest of the mall. As part of the 2011-2014 mall renovations, this area was renovated and Bourbon Street was renamed BRBN ST.\nEuropa Boulevard: Eclectic shops in an area designed to look like a European streetscape. It is home to Europa Watch & Jewelry, Fleurs Flowers, Opulence, G-Star Raw, Plush Skateboard Shop, Dr. Martens, B3, Cafe Levi, FYidoctors, Frank & Oak, Yasmin, Stitch It and several rentable conference rooms that look down on the Boulevard.

It is located directly above Bourbon Street. The \"Chinatown\" signage was removed in May 2012 and the section, though still maintaining an Asian decor, is no longer exclusive to such businesses.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Shops ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Upgrades ==\nConstruction on a total renovation of the mall shopping areas through all the phases began in spring 2011. The 'face lift' included the renovation of all mall common areas, which started in Phase I and finished in Phase IV. The most notable upgrades included the retrofit of an existing water fountain into new choreographed musical dancing fountains, hanging decor of ceramic roses in the Rose Court outside Victoria's Secret and glass oil droplets around the Oilmen Statue outside the Phase I Food Court. Most of the renovations were completed in 2014, however some areas of the mall continue construction, such as Park Lane and Chinatown.In 2017, the mall announced that the Mayfield Toyota Ice Palace would undergo a renovation, retrofitting it with the latest technologies. The Ice Palace closed in mid 2017 and reopened in December. Later in mid 2018, the mall announced that the World Waterpark would undergo renovations worth $2.5 million in September 2018. All upgrades have since been completed.\n\n\n== Future developments ==\nIn 2002, the City of Edmonton approved plans for the mall to expand with an additional 30,000 square metres (320,000 sq ft) of retail space, a facility for sports, trade shows and conventions, a 12-story office building, and a 600-unit apartment building, along with more parking. However, none of these projects has begun construction except for the completed parking lot expansion located by the Rec Room.\nOn 16 October 2019, local car dealership Mayfield Toyota announced that will relocate to the West Edmonton Mall. The dealership, which will be primarily located in the old Sears store, will be approximately 118,000 square-feet and include up to 65 service bays, a detailing center, and a three aisle drive-thru that will intersect the entire mall. The project will also include the addition of a 200,000 square-foot parkade with 1000 parking stalls and valet service.\n\n\n== Security ==\nIn February 2015, the jihadist terrorist group al-Shabaab released a propaganda video calling for attacks on the West Edmonton Mall and other Western shopping centres. Although the group had hitherto never launched attacks in North America, security at the mall was tightened in response. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also indicated that there was no evidence of any imminent threat.In response to growing security threats, West Edmonton Mall has developed a lockdown protocol in case of major emergencies. Drills continue to be executed every two to three months.\n\n\n=== Controversies ===\nWest Edmonton Mall was the object of a controversy in 2011 when, after arresting a woman for trespassing, their security staff were caught on video allegedly assaulting her. A judge had agreed to release the video after the charges against the woman were dismissed.\n\n\n== West Edmonton Mall Transit Centre ==\nThe West Edmonton Mall Transit Centre is a major transit centre on the south side of West Edmonton Mall, outside mall entrance 48. Buses using the transit centre enter and exit from 87 Avenue. The large shelter building at the transit centre is accessible and equipped with power doors. This transit centre has vending machines and a pay phone but no park & ride, public washrooms, or drop off area. The transit centre is served by Edmonton Transit System (ETS) and St. Albert Transit (StAT).\n$3 million in upgrades to the transit centre were completed in June 2017 and included a new heated indoor shelter (double the size of the previous shelter), new sidewalks, new lighting, and a new public art installation, among other changes.The LRT System's upcoming Valley Line West extension will include an elevated station at the West Edmonton Mall Transit Centre.The following bus routes serve the transit centre:\n\nSchool special routes that arrive/depart from West Edmonton Mall Transit Centre include routes: 1S, 2S, 4S, 14S, 100S, 102S, 103S, 107S, 109S, 112S, 115S, and 150S.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of shopping malls in Canada\nList of largest enclosed shopping malls in Canada\nList of largest shopping malls in the world\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Over the years we have so enjoyed the Waterpark, Galaxyland, ice rink, submarine, sea life show, penguins, and the mini golf and food courts. Lots to do for all ages. I like the layout of the mall. This year I was disappointed to see empty storefronts. Hope the economy improves",
          "This place blew my mind. I\u2019m not one for shopping, but I really enjoyed exploring this mall for an afternoon. I only walked 2 floors and it took me about 2 hours. They have everything here; a petting zoo, aquarium (with seals), water park, amusement park, every store",
          "I think you can spend several days just here. I just wonder around for 3-4 hours, still I regret that I had few plans in this mall. It is good to be lost in the mall. Lots of things to see & do.",
          "This mall is gigantic. It can be hard to find parking around the mall because this place is very popular for tourists and locals. West Edmonton Mall is full of shops. There are also options for dining, cafes, ice skating, Bingo, Casino, the water park, galaxyland, exploring a",
          "One must experience the world's largest shopping and entertainment complex. This massive complex hosts over 850 stores & restaurants, a wave pool, an indoor roller coaster and amusement park, ice skating rink, bungee jump, seaworld, and a tropical rainforest. It was a nice",

          "Love coming to this mall whether its to shop or just kill time! Lots of stores and restaurants to pick from. And quite a few attractions!",
          "WOW I was told that the mall was massive, but it\u2019s until you see it for yourself you understand how big it is... I lost count of how many stores there were, but there\u2019s a amusement park, waterpark, mini golf, ice skating ring and countless food courts.",
          "Quite the spectacle. Huge mall, everything you could imagine. Roller coasters, water slides, skating rink, gun range. Worth checking out but i think if i were looking to actually shop for something i would go somewhere smaller and quieter",
          "This is certainly a large mall, but it is the attractions which make it interesting and set it apart from other 'regular' malls. It felt strange spending the day inside on a nice summer's day, but I think this place would be great to spend a day at in the Edmonton winter.",
          "Avoid the mall during the end of August back to School blitz, as well as mid-December to January 10th.... Its an amazing mall but parking and accessibility during these times is insane.",

          "Visited here for the first time this past August. I have been in a lot of malls throughout North America but this has to be the largest ever. I found parking easy and the mall was easy to navigate, lots of dining options and of course lots of shopping. The arena in the middle of",

          "Perhaps this is well known already but wanted a cool title. There is a lot to see here amusement park water park 2 mini golf courses a pirate ship and soon a go kart track are just a few of the many things to see. It is a big place and maybe would be good to have more than 1 day",

          "Went with d\u00e0ycare field trip, the staff were very good with the small children. They interacted with them and explained the different animals and fish at their level. The seal lion show was great, everyone throughly enjoyed every bit of it.",
          "We did a three day family vacation with two families and 6 teens at The WEM. Great activities : Escape room, waterpark, skating rink, amusement park, Mini golf, great restaurant choices, and of course, an amazing amount of shopping. And so much more ! Almost has a cruise",
          "This mall is quite famous. Have visited many times. Noticed two unusual problems compared to other large shopping centres. The mall is huge but there are surprisingly few washrooms, and extremely limited sitting areas. I'm not sure why the mall uses this strategy, but these two",
          "Shop till you drop! So many stores. Lots to do! Waterpark is awesome and Galaxyland is great! We try to visit WEM once a year. Great for families, solo, whatever. But be ready to spend the money :)",

          "I didn't think I would find myself going to the shopping mall when travelling on this type of vacation. But when somebody claims they have the biggest mall in North America, you have to see what the big fuzz is all about. This mall has an amusement park, water park with wave",
          "We come here every year when travelling and like it everytime. Lots of shopping places large selection of clothing and usually everyone friendly here. Also large big waterpark in doors and a mini fair if you would say. Roller coaster small ferris wheel other rides ect. Sea lion",
          "WEM has a great selection of stores - pretty much everything you could ever want. It also has all the extra stuff like water park, skating rink, roller coaster and sadly some marine life exhibits which are super cruel and hideous. If they closed that down it would be 5 stars -",
          "This place is beyond belief, it not only has every type of shop and food outlet you can think of it also has an ice rink a pirate ship and a large crazy golf course. Something a bit special with plenty of places to sit and rest",
          "This is a part of Contemporary consumption Society monument. It icludes a lot of shops, amasing places and attractions. Perfecr for a winter time, which is pretty long in Edmonton. One may stay there for a day and have something remaning for a next visit there.",
          "We're over from the UK visiting and were taken to this shopping complex. Simply marvellous. There's soooooooo much to do and take in. Really loved the atmosphere and the kid's enjoyed every moment of the visit. 100% worth the visit and be prepared to feast the eyes",

          "We just stopped in quick for a bit of shopping. We did not go into Galaxy land or water park. Otherwise it\u2019s just a mall.",
          "Huge place. We walked both floors and it was about 3 miles. The place is well maintained with only a few store vacancies. The only thing that we noticed is that they didn\u2019t have as many stores as some of the smaller malls - but if you want a weekend adventure, this is the place",
          "Spent day in the water park. Had a blast in the pool, with the big wave coming out. Can rent tubes for this pool. Watersides were pretty cool as well, there are lots of bigger ones that some of our group were scared off. Good for people seeking an adventure. Can also rent",

          "The West Edmonton Mall is a huge mall, that is one thing that anyone who has ever visited will point out - and rightfully so. When our friends found out that we will be visiting Edmonton, they told us this is a 'must see' place. To me it is just a big mall with lots and lots",
          "West Edmonton Mall is a cool place to hang out, shop and eat. There is every kind of store you can want along with a movie theatre, water park, hotel, Ice skating rink, amusement park, as well as many food options from food court food to higher-end restaurants. I would",

          "This is your typical mall but spread over a large area. It host a hockey rink, a pladium type park with medium thrill roller coasters, a large swimming pool and much more. All in all, its a good place to visit if you happen to kill some time in Edmonton",
          "So first time try'n the VR \"egg shell\" attraction. It cost $ 15 pre person for about a 7-8 min turn. Not great :( even if it didn't make me nauseous the quality of the head set picture was disappointing. Old graphics and the roller coaster style game didn't offer a challenging",
          "Worth a visit to look at the wave pool, skate rink and kids adventure park otherwise just a large mall",

          "West Edmonton Mall is not just for shopping it has indoor swimming pool, ice hockey field and another big pool at the bottom of the shopping center with sea lions and a big pirate ship and a movie theatre. The place is perfect for a day trip to shop, to swim and maybe there is",

          "I\u2019m directionally challenged so sometimes I got lost for searching stores. There are sea lion show for free, cineplex (cinema) and lots of restaurants! You can go there by bus too. It\u2019s really convenient to go there by bus. I recommend to you if you stay in Edmonton.",
          "I had been to WEM many times, but it was the first time my children came along. Let me tell you that they will dream about the place for a good while! They enjoyed the stores, attractions, food and incredible sights! The food court was gorgeous and offered great options! We",

          "I am not a lover of shopping or of Malls but I visited West Edmonton Mall as I had heard so much about it. It is difficult not to be impressed by the sheer size of this building. It is bright and extremely clean with every conceivable shop and eatery. The fairground, huge",

          "The shopping is good, there are a lot of food options (sit down and quick service) as well as the water park and ride area. The ride area is a little dated.",
          "If you love shopping and getting your steps in, then this is the place for you. It took us two days to see everything the mall had to offer.",
          "The mall while quite old has a fresh look and plethora of shopping and eating options. Add in the hotel, water park and rides and you can see why it is a shopoing and holiday destination. If you can\u2019t find what you want in the mall, maybe you don\u2019t really need it. From liquor",
          "Didn\u2019t enter a single shop as none seemed unique to Edmonton vs our own city. We found it hard to commit to other activities since they were all so pricey (shooting range, mini golf, water park, Galaxyland etc).",

          "The mall has great restaurants, amusements, shopping and necessities. There is so much to see and do! We spent half a day, shopping and finding everything we needed while enjoying all the extras. The mall is a destination and well worth a visit. If you don't want to spend money,",

          "The mall is huge... that's about the only thing about it that's impressive. It's just a typical mall. All that space and not really many unique stores. A lot of stores had multiple locations as well which seems redundant. Nice to see but honestly wouldn't go out of my way to go",
          "Went there on a weekend . This is one huge mall . Not only selling international brands but mostly Canadian as well. Lots of walking. Restrooms are usually found on the food court. Doesn\u2019t offer free WiFi inside. But lots of activities for everyone, especially children. From",

          "Visited this shopping mall whilst on holiday from the UK and visiting Edmonton. It was amazing and we haven't anything like this in the uk. Loads of shops but also a funfair, swimming centre, place selling cars, great choice of eating places etc all within the one roof.",
          "A visit to the mall is what you make it. We had a great time. Mall was clean and well maintained. New places like the Rec room give even more things to do",
          "A large shopping mall. I only went there to buy tourist souvenirs which were lacking in the CBD. Malls are not my thing to be honest. Yes it has a skating rink, an amusement park, seal show, etc but it just didn't really impress it.",
          "So I was excited to see the famous West Edmonton Mall and I came away a little disappointed. Parking was easy, the interactive maps are great at finding your way back, just remember your exit number. Watched a sea lion show which was educational but I always worry how small",
          "The mall is massive and has places to sit and rest more so along the main level, but very few on the upper level. It definitely has places that benches could be placed on the upper level, so maybe in the future they will put more out. The mall is quite busy even during off peak",
          "We don't spend a lot of time at malls, but this is the largest in North America so we had to check it out. It is very comparable to The Mall of America for Americans looking for an idea of what to expect. There is a waterpark with a huge wave pool and zip line overhead, an",
          "We made a special trip to the West Edmonton Mall just to see it. We were not disappointed. There are many many many stores, they claim over 800, and the collection includes the standard chains, and many high end stores. One can walk around for a long time. There are many very",
          "I have been to this mall hundreds and hundreds of times and I am still amazed by it. There is a very wide variety of stores for all income brackets. From your Dollarama, to the Gap to Tiffany's there is a bit of everything. It's an ideal shopping experience if your hunting for",
          "Spent a lot of time at the West Edmonton Mall.... It is huge and very crowded. Anything you want basically can be purchased in this mall... Great place to people watch. - They do need to have more rest areas though.",
          "We did enjoy our time at the mall - over 8 hours. The kids had a blast. We did the marine museum and Galaxyland. We\u2019re not much into shopping , but if we were, it\u2019s all there. There\u2019s so many people everywhere, of course... I sucked it up and went for the kids.",

          "Although I have been before I still am allways ver impressed with the shear size and amount of thing to do and shops to have a look around. The roller-coaster and water park are very rare thing to see in a mall. You could spend all day here and still have more shops to go to. If",

          "I well remember the excitement decades ago when the West Edmonton Mall first opened. Then and since then, the biggest draw seems to be its enormous size. On a recent business trip I decided for a re-visit, only to be sorely disappointed. This mall is stuck in the 70\u2019s and for me",

          "WEM has everything you need, whether local to the Edmonton area or visiting from a far. It has a variety of restaurants, shops and things to do.",

          "It is huge and i mean really huge. Take at least 5-6 hours just for the shops and dining. You should take whole another day just for the water park inside. Management is really good and shops are all well organized , not very expensive either.",
          "This Mall id gianormous. I think there are over 800 stores, hotels, water park, ice rink, and a pirate ship. If the store isn't here, you don't need it. If you manage to find somewhere to park in there 20,000 parking spaces, you will find that for the most part, the mall",

          "I grew up in near Edmonton and hung out at the mall as a kid. Over the years I have come and gone several times from the mall when in the area visiting and it never gets old. Lots to see and do with the theme park, waterslides, shopping and other attractions. I have stayed at",

          "I love this place. Tbh I have just seen maybe half the mall, and that much was amazing so I am sure the other half will also be equally amazing. I just needed more time to check out the whole mall. Next time for sure cover the whole mall. \u2026",
          "Just terrible customer service!! Online system messed up my payment -TWICE- and they refuse to do anything to help us attend the event at the water park. It\u2019s been about 6 years since the last time we went to the water park because last \u2026",
          "Come on. It's West Ed. This place is the best. I once saw two giant cockroaches eating a fallen bag of some kind of food outside the water park. I've fallen in a fountain here twice. There's an entire wing of the mall dedicated solely to \u2026",
          "Proper covid-19 and social distance practices are in place.",
          "It was a friendly environment, has protocols to follow durning this time, & let everyone know that we are in tough time together.",
          "Very cool place to go. The food and attractions were great. Definately have to try the water massages in the first floor!",
          "Atm hand sanitizer is out of control and following the arrows to walk gets frustrating when it takes 10 minutes to turn around...",
          "I would consider this place a heritage site. West Ed has been open and thriving since the 1980s and is a place to take the family. But if you decide to go pack a lunch\u2026 Or better yet feel free to make use of the many food spots throughout \u2026",
          "This place will always be remembered. I've only been here 3 or 4 times and I doubt I saw all it has to offer. I loved the water park, I loved the pirate ship, just walking through the city of stores was incredible. Highly recommended.",
          "Easy to get around. Not crowded or noisy. Clean. Lots of choice shopping. Good food and great service.",
          "Because of the Covid pandemic not all stores are open and all restaurants are closed. The stores that are open do have safety measures in place to protect both staff and customers",
          "Huge. Lots of stores. Something for everyone. Whether it's fine dining. Window shopping or exercising. You can spend a whole day and still not cover the place.",

          "always a great place to stay everything you need is within walking distance",
          "Giant mall with something for everyone!!! So many shops and attractions. Can get lost in this mall very easily. They are slowly renovating the entire mall...\nThe new spots are beautiful... the old spots... not so much. Usually pretty busy on weekends. Go on a much less common day and you\u2019ll have a much better time.",
          "Best days to go are during week day's as it's not too packed, but stay away on weekends unless you enjoy being nudged, hit, stomped on as the crowds are horrendous. As one of the only places to go for Edmontonians the owners must be loaded \u2026",
          "One of the best malls I ever seen in my life.",
          "Awesome place to spend three hours on a winter afternoon. Lots of cool stores and activities. Not to mention all the arcade games at the Rec room and the Scotia bank theatre",
          "Happy yo see the mall is getting lively once again",
          "Absolute confusion, nobody had a clue on which direction to walk. Even though there are extremely large stickers all over the floor! Social distancing, what the hell is that? A breeding ground for covid!",
          "It is an amazing place to travel with friends and family. I love the aura of the place and there's countless things to do. One day is not enough to do everything. Loved the seal show.",
          "Honestly one of the best family adventures we've had in a while.  The people at the hotel, the waiters and waitresses throughout the lounges and restaurants in the mall, just everything about it was fantastic.  The people of Edmonton are always fantastic, just such a great time I can't say it enough.",
          "Definitely the best place to shop on Edmonton. One of the largest malls in the world, with activities, shops, and food to keep you satisfied. Feeling bored? You could go watch a movie at the  theatre or maybe catch a few rides in Galaxy \u2026",
          "HUGE MALL. I was born and raised here in this city and still can't find the time to walk the entire mall and visit every single store. \n\nTill this day it still stands as the largest mall in all of North America (fun fact if you were ever \u2026",
          "Best thing for me is - there is samsung Galaxy Repair store\ud83d\ude05",
          "As malls go, it's hard to beat West Edmonton Mall.  Even in the midst of a broad economic turn down in Alberta, the mall was packed to the rafters with shoppers and people wandering around it's vast expanse.  Countless restaurants to choose \u2026",
          "Many great shops, often unique and original, make for a great day for shoppers of all tastes. Also many interesting sights for the window shoppers.",
          "There\u2019s a lot to check out specially on Boxing Day. Moreover, parking is not a problem even on thanksgiving sales. The water park is awesome, kids will surely enjoy.",
          "I like wild west shooting.  The mall is fairly cool as well.  Always busy though.",

          "Loved it. Accessible by public transit. A good place for shopping variety of brands. Beautiful place with lots of side attractions.",
          "Huge huge mall.\nYou require atleast two days to look around.\nCan get some good deals here.\nLiked the food court.",
          "Always a good experience. Priced are reasonable and the selection of stores is huge. One thing that is a downside is that there aren't many water fountains. Food selection is great and Burboun Street within the mall stays open later than \u2026",
          "Love this mall. I never realized that there was no admission to the sea caverns until 4pm. That was cool my kids loved it. Bummed that wetzels pretzels is gone but oh well.",
          "Amazing place to hang out. So many paths but you can use the digital maps.",
          "A huge beacon to consumerism. There's plenty of parking and thing's to do here. It is a good escape from the cold winter days in Edmonton. Overall I didn't feel like the mall was anything vastly different to what I've seen elsewhere. I can \u2026",

          "Quite an entertaining place to stay. Kids will surely have fun with the indoor pool and water park. Almost all the shops you know are there. Prices are reasonable.",
          "This place is amazing, I love shopping here all the time.  It's not too hard to find your way around and there's a diverse amount of places to shop at.  Not only is it good for shopping but also just to hang out with some friends",
          "Lots of new stores. Always enjoy walking through the mall. Can always find a deal or two!!",
          "We went to the crystal and gem sale , really enjoyed ourselves bought a few presents had o few laughs",

          "Fun to take the family and friends from out of town, but as a local I would definitely never go out of my way to stop here to meet my shopping needs. Far too large and spread out and busy! Always busy. \n\nIt's fun for tourists or guests \u2026",
          "Huge mall with plenty of fun things to do and lots of great shops :)",
          "Stores are quite assorted! I highly recommend spending an afternoon. Tons to do such as: Mini Golf, Galaxy Land, VR, Arcades, Waterpark, and the many other attractions! So much diversity with food choices. I remember old bourbon street but \u2026",

          "Place is good, lots of shops and places to go to, parking is terrible, food places are alright. All in all its a good place to walk around and see what's in store. If you want a place that will give you what you want right away, this is not for you. It requires a lot of walking and time looking for parking space",
          "So many stores! I enjoy shopping here. Very nice mall. Could spend hours on end here.",
          "You cannot mix luxury with cheap, plus is an ugly design and not very diverse. They said it was a huge mall but is not huge at all",

          "Good place to shop. Water park is fun. If you want air tube, take at the time of entry instead of coming out again from water park and going to locker. Yes you can rent locker for your belongings.",
          "Has many different stores and food places to choose from very easy to get around or lost if your new water park and galaxy land is awesome. Best place to shop around if you have the extra money to hang for the day",

          "I haven't been to the west Edmonton mall in almost 10 years.. and to be honest .. it brings me back to when I was younger.. not alot has changed. But it's still an awesome place to be. Lots to do still.. and new shops just keep popping up and events keep on happenin. Keep it up. Best mall ever",
          "Huge mall, lots of stores with some duplicates.  Has a huge water park with wave pool and many many slides, great morning with the kids there.   Then their is Galaxy land huge amusement park inside the mall.  Also a Sea lion show in a huge \u2026",
          "Mall is a one stop shop location. However over the years starting to see many retailers leave. The mall should try and save retailers from leaving instead of raising rent. The mall is overdue for a renovation. Parts of the mall is outdated \u2026",
          "Great place to eat. The owner even open the doors half a early on sunday for the wife and I. We didn't  see the sign on the hours that they  were open. She did wave us in, and said that everything was  not ready yet, but if you don't mind we get you start on a drink.. we will be going again.",
          "Before this place was much better. There were submarines, palms, aquarium. It was amazing place! Now it is just shopping center.",
          "This mall has been one of my favourite places since the 90's. Galaxy Land is the best! I waited many years to be tall enough to ride the mind bender roller coaster. WHICH IS AMAZING!!! Many other rides as well! Plus climbing walls, fun \u2026",
          "Lots of fun! Could spend a day or 2 here. Definitely visit Galaxy World! Lots of fun. Highlight of Edmonton!",
          "A great mall! You'll find what you need easily. It's very busy but what do we expect from North America's largest shopping mall, right?",
          "Good food. Good atmosphere. Sound check needs work. Mics and sound were cutting out . Band was good but the sound tech needs to do some work!",
          "The bus (Bus 2) to the WEM from my house was straight forward and parked right opposite one of the entrances. And the ride back (Bus 106) was just as straight forward. I went with my 2 children for the Black Friday extravaganza at the West Edmonton Mall and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",
          "Spent a few days in the mall. Went to the water park galaxyland, and the food court. Had a great time with the children, however I wish they had a bit better package pricing for families",
          "This mall has almost everything you need. Plenty of stores to shop and good restaurants",

          "This mall has so much to offer. From all the different kinds of shopping you would ever need. To an awesome wife variety of  restaurants. There is a hotel, casino, bowling alley, aquarium where they do water shows, a huge indoor water park \u2026",

          "Covid 19 precautions make the mall difficult to navigate... long walks are required to get to a shop you wish to visit since they are trying to force one way traffic",

Be it for adults, kids, families there is something for every one. A must go place",

          "Great mall, so much variety of stores and lots for families to do. Parking is fairly easy and traffic flows nicely in and out of parking lot. Check out the tasty choices in the food mart. Buy Buy Baby is awesome, friendly staff in Melanie Lyn, Simons has lots of great quality clothing and home decor",
          "I always find going here fun to see what new updates have taken place or what new attractions have been installed. I think this place goes largely underappreciated for most Albertans as we can visit whenever and fail to recognize the \u2026",

          ".there is something for every shopping \"need or want\" here... short of a car dealership or a new home - but you can buy the furniture  for that new home.  Major retail and specialty  chains of all kinds from budget minded to high \u2026",
          "Biggest mall and good thing we can almost everything in this mall",

Has waterpark and sea lion show 2-4pm, as well as small amusement park, all located inside the mall, lots of shops, restaurants + food courts, T&T supermarket, its perfect place to shop and eat! If there is a hotel operating inside the mall, I would def. Considering living for 2 days, haha",
          "This review is for the Waterpark only. They need to move their pricing and customer experience into the 21st century. They offer Valued Price options but they seem to only be available when it's convenient for them and not their customers. \u2026",
          "Great place to shop! One stop for your needs.",

          "As someone who moved to Edmonton about 5 years ago, I still enjoy going to WEM at least once a month. Simply for the mall walking alone! Obviously be prepared that it can get quite busy. Otherwise, it's always a hoot and a half. The ice rink has terrible acoustics and can be quite annoying when a hockey game is scheduled.",
          "I\u2019ve been going to the mall since Phase 1 first opened and have watched every addition, change, renovation and more over the years.  From shopping to the waterpark, movies, banquets, food, dining and scavenger hunts - West Edmonton Mall has \u2026",
          "We always make a stop in at the WEM, the kids love running around the mall. The Disney store is a hit but it's a bit tight in that particular store. \nNice to have a massive indoor mall especially in a northern climate like Edmonton. It can get a bit crazy in there during peak hours but mostly a good experience for us.",
          "Loved the drop walls they have as soon as you get into the mall. Great idea with 4 different scenes. Would love to see it at Christmas time",

          "Has everything you could possibly be looking for. Can spend anywhere from 20 mins to all day wandering around. Worth checking out if you are from out of town. The attractions are well worth your time! If you're local I highly recommend the annual pass to let you in to all mall attractions!",

          "First time going there and wow it was unbelievably big!! Loved that it offered a whole lot of stores but it was a pain for the walking (lol). But the interior design is really fun, nice and will definitely come back soon to try the waterpark and theme park!",

          "Great options, so many interactive guide boards.\n\nFood courts are clean and many selections. \n\nThe mall houses activity facilities like the water park, galaxy land, an ice rink, and a small marine zoo. In the winter, this is a great option \u2026",

          "Convid 19 measures in place is very impressive",
          "Disappointed in the Scotiabank theater. Left my scarf there a week ago and he said they get one a day.  He had 4 scarfs and not mine. Probably a staff member kept it. It was a very long a fashionable scarf I wore with my dress coat",
          "Sidra is a good worker and introduced some cool products to my cousin and I. Would recommend this nicely valued store to anyone!",
          "Everything here is thinly veneered as high-end and classy, but I assure you, the only thing high-end is the price tags :)",

          "Loved it, needs more than 1 day to visit, didn't see everything, was fun seeing the pirate boat and the seal show, didn't go in rollercoaster ride, would have loved to go in it, maybe next time and would have loved to go to the swimming pool but another time. Lots of walking so be prepare for it.",

          "I LOVE West Edmonton Mall. The only thing I would suggest is to maybe put signs to ask people to walk on their right side of the corridor/hallways. It just seems some people don\u2019t know how to walk respectfully in public. I recognize my pet \u2026",
          "Nice mall with a lot of stores. Definitely if you are looking for something you will find it here",
          "Not sure I can give West Edmonton Mall 5 stars. They used to have peacocks. They used to have a fleet of submarines that was greater than the Canadian Navy. It used to be the largest mall in the world. It used to have a fire breathing dragon.",

          "It's a great big mall but it didn't cater to my needs. My family need to go for prayers and I had to leave the mall so that they can pray.\nI wish if there was a space in the mall I didn't have to leave and I didn't return because I was not looking for parking wars again",

          "The mall as a whole I only give three stars due to  uncleanness from the pool and galaxyland. The mass amounts of people making it hard to even walk. Along with the many many scandals that the mall itself has had. Positive feedback I have \u2026",
          "Great place to spend a hour or all day. A endless list of things to do thats not just shopping, great restaurants and a great food court.

          "Everything and more. And things you didn't imagine you could spend money on. Like stuffy riderz and walking on a pirate ship deck. I never know where I am, lots of stores. I need more money for this. One part is little faux village buildings it is really cute. They should put a cat in the windowsill.",
          "Nice place to shop, eat and stroll. Huge parking lot, not to mention they have an overflow parking lot. They have 2 food courts looted at both ends of the mall when you get hungry or thirsty at middle of your shopping. There is a play area for kids, the galaxy land that will keep the kiddos busy.",
          "Despite the fact that West Edmonton Mall is rated one of the largest malls or almost the largest mall in North America, I feel that the services and amenities there are not as much. They are comparable to other smaller malls and also South \u2026",

          "I felt it was poorly organized and did not have easy access to maps at all entrances. I grew up in Edmonton but have only been to the mall a handful of times. I think if it is a tourist attraction then even nincompoops like me should be \u2026",

          "Overall, its a nice mall. Most of the stores have decent prices (though not many have sales or clearance racks) and there's often at least a few sales. All the different attractions are a tiny bit gimmicky, but they make the atmosphere \u2026",

          "There was no excitement in the mall. As a kid it was \"Go to place!\". Now in my 50's, it was sad to see number of business's in the mall that have left. Maybe it's the market in Alberta is so bad that people are not shopping there anymore. \u2026",
          "very fun place for tours. but the same store outside of the mall got cheaper price on most of the products",
          "This truly is the best mall ever, it has every store you can imagine. They also have a giant Waterpark if you're interested. I'm happy I had the chance to visit this mall while I was in Edmonton.",

          "The mall is getting a little bit tired but the stores are still consistently good. I went there with one week left before Christmas and it wasn\u2019t even packed (ok, it was at 10:30 a.m.) which was good for me but bad for the shop owners. \u2026",

So many shops, so many good choices, so many choices of sitting areas (which is quite needed!)\n\nObviously quite a stealer with the ship - great for photos if anybody ever visits. \n\nI wish there is more presence of security around parking areas.

          "It's a mall, but one with an ice skating/hockey rink, theme park, water park, live seal show, and The RecRoom with the VOID. And it's MASSIVE. Uniqlo just opened as well as it's connected to a full size T&T Mart for asian goods and foods. Highly recommended, and you can easily spend a few hours here.",

        "wiki": "Edmonton ( (listen)) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. The city anchors the north end of what Statistics Canada defines as the \"Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor\".The city had a population of 932,546 in 2016, making it Alberta's second-largest city and Canada's fifth-largest municipality. Edmonton's 2019 municipal census subsequently recorded a population of 972,223. Also in 2016, Edmonton had a metropolitan population of 1,321,426, making it the sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is North America's northernmost metropolitan area with a population over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian.Edmonton's historic growth has been facilitated through the absorption of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North Edmonton, West Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place) in addition to a series of annexations through 1982, and the annexation of 8,260 ha (82.6 km2) of land from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont on January 1, 2019. Known as the \"Gateway to the North\", the city is a staging point for large-scale oil sands projects occurring in northern Alberta and large-scale diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories.Edmonton is a cultural, governmental and educational centre. It hosts a year-round slate of festivals, reflected in the nickname \"Canada's Festival City\". It is home to North America's largest mall, West Edmonton Mall (the world's largest mall from 1981 until 2004), and Fort Edmonton Park, Canada's largest living history museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants arrived in the area that is now Edmonton around 3000 BC and perhaps as early as 12,000 BC when an ice-free corridor opened as the last glacial period ended and timber, water, and wildlife became available in the region.\n\nIn 1754, Anthony Henday, an explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area. His expeditions across the Canadian Prairies were mainly to seek contact with the Indigenous population for establishing the fur trade, as the competition was fierce between the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. \nBy 1795, Fort Edmonton was established on the river's north bank as a major trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company, near the mouth of the Sturgeon River close to present-day Fort Saskatchewan. Fort Edmonton, also known as Edmonton House, was built within \"musket-shot range\" of the rival North West Company's (NWC) Fort Augustus. The fort's name was chosen by William Tomison, who was in charge of its construction, for Edmonton, Middlesex, England, home town of the Lake family \u2013 at least five of whom were influential members of the HBC between 1696-1807. Although both forts were initially successful, declines in beaver pelt hauls and firewood stocks forced both HBC and NWC to move their forts upstream.By 1813, after some changes in location, Fort Edmonton was established in the area of what is now Rossdale, beginning Edmonton's start as a permanent population centre. The fort was located on the border of territory that was disputed by the Blackfoot and Cree nations. Furthermore, the fort intersected territory patrolled by the Blackfoot Confederacy to the South, and the Cree, Dene, and Nakoda nations to the North. After the North West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Augustus was closed in favour of Fort Edmonton.In 1876, Treaty 6, which includes what is now Edmonton, was signed between the Indigenous peoples in Canada (or First Nations) and Queen Victoria as Queen of Canada, as part of the Numbered Treaties of Canada. The agreement includes the Plains and Woods Cree, Assiniboine, and other band governments of First Nations at Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt, and Battle River. The area covered by the treaty represents most of the central area of the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.The coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to southern Alberta in 1885 helped the Edmonton economy, and the 1891 building of the Calgary and Edmonton (C&E) Railway resulted in the emergence of a railway townsite (South Edmonton/Strathcona) on the river's south side, across from Edmonton. The arrival of the CPR and the C&E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs from eastern Canada, Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world. The Edmonton area's fertile soil and cheap land attracted settlers, further establishing Edmonton as a major regional commercial and agricultural centre. Some people participating in the Klondike Gold Rush passed through South Edmonton/Strathcona in 1897. Strathcona was North America's northernmost railway point, but travel to the Klondike was still very difficult for the \"Klondikers,\" and a majority of them took a steamship north to the Yukon from Vancouver, British Columbia.\n \nIncorporated as a town in 1892 with a population of 700 and then as a city in 1904 with a population of 8,350, Edmonton became the capital of Alberta when the province was formed a year later, on September 1, 1905. In November 1905, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) arrived in Edmonton, accelerating growth.During the early 1900s, Edmonton's rapid growth led to speculation in real estate. In 1912, Edmonton amalgamated with the City of Strathcona, south of the North Saskatchewan River; as a result, the city extended south of the North Saskatchewan River for the first time.Just before World War I, the boom ended, and the city's population declined from more than 72,000 in 1914 to less than 54,000 only two years later. Many impoverished families moved to subsistence farms outside the city, while others fled to greener pastures in other provinces. Recruitment to the army during the war also contributed to the drop in population. Afterwards, the city slowly recovered in population and economy during the 1920s and 1930s and took off again during and after World War II.\nThe Edmonton City Centre Airport opened in 1929, becoming Canada's first licensed airfield. Originally named Blatchford Field in honour of former mayor Kenny Blatchford, pioneering aviators such as Wilfrid R. \"Wop\" May and Max Ward used Blatchford Field as a major base for distributing mail, food, and medicine to Northern Canada; hence Edmonton's emergence as the \"Gateway to the North\". World War II saw Edmonton become a major base for the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Northwest Staging Route. The airport was closed in November 2013.On July 31, 1987, a devastating F4 tornado hit the city and killed 27 people. The storm hit the areas of Beaumont, Mill Woods, Bannerman, Fraser, and Evergreen. The day became known as \"Black Friday.\"\n\n\n=== History of municipal governance ===\n\nIn 1892 Edmonton was incorporated as a town. The first mayor was Matthew McCauley, who established the first school board in Edmonton and Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) and a municipal police service. Due to McCauley's good relationship with the federal Liberals, Edmonton maintained economic and political prominence over Strathcona, a rival settlement/town/city on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Edmonton was incorporated as a city in 1904 and became Alberta's capital in 1905.\nIn 1904, the City of Edmonton purchased the Edmonton District Telephone Company  for $17,000 from Alex Taylor (businessman), a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor and politician. Amalgamated into a city department as City of Edmonton Telephone Department, City Telephone System (CTS), 'edmonton telephones'. In 1989, City Council voted to create Edmonton Telephones Corporation  to operate as an autonomous organization under a board of directors appointed by the city. In 1995, City of Edmonton ownership of its telephone service ended when ED TEL was sold to the TELUS corporation. City Bylaw 11713 created The Ed Tel Endowment Fund whereas the shares owned by Edmonton Telephones Corporation in Ed Tel Inc. were sold by the City of Edmonton to Telus on March 10, 1995 for $470,221,872 to be invested for the perpetual benefit of Edmontonians. \nUnions and radical organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World struggled for progressive social change through the early years, with the first reformer, James East, elected in 1912, followed by the first official Labour alderman, James Kinney, the following year. Many thousands of workers participated in the Edmonton general strike of 1919 and a strong block of Labour representatives were on council after the next election: East, Kinney, Sam McCoppen, Rice Sheppard and Joe Clarke.\nThe City used Single Transferable Vote (STV), a form of proportional representation, for elections from 1923 to 1927, in which councillors were elected at large with ranked transferable votes.\nLabour representation on city council became a near-majority in 1929, and a full majority from 1932 to 1934, during the Great Depression. Jan Reimer became the city's first female mayor when she was elected in 1989.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nEdmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River, at an elevation of 671 m (2,201 ft). It is North America's northernmost city with a metropolitan population over one million. It is at the same latitude as Hamburg (Germany); Dublin (Ireland); Manchester (United Kingdom); and Magnitogorsk (Russia). It is south of Alberta's geographic centre, which is near the Hamlet of Fort Assiniboine. The terrain in and around Edmonton is generally flat to gently rolling, with ravines and deep river valleys, such as the North Saskatchewan River valley. The Canadian Rockies are west of Edmonton and about 220 km (140 mi) to the southwest.\nThe North Saskatchewan River originates at the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park and bisects the city. It sometimes floods Edmonton's river valley, most notably in the North Saskatchewan River flood of 1915. It empties via the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. It runs from the southwest to the northeast and is fed by numerous creeks throughout the city, including Mill Creek, Whitemud Creek and Blackmud Creek; these creeks have created ravines, some of which are used for urban parkland. Edmonton is within the Canadian Prairies Ecozone. Aspen parkland surrounds the city and is a transitional area from the prairies to the south and boreal forest in the north. The aspen woods and forests in and around Edmonton have long since been reduced by farming and residential and commercial developments including oil and natural gas exploration.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEdmonton has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dwb). It falls into the NRC 4a Plant Hardiness Zone.The city is known for having cold winters, though its weather is milder than Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, all of which are south of Edmonton. Its average daily temperatures range from a low of \u221210.4 \u00b0C (13.3 \u00b0F) in January to a summer peak of 17.7 \u00b0C (63.9 \u00b0F) in July. With average maximum of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F) in July, and minimum of \u221214.8 \u00b0C (5.4 \u00b0F) in January. Temperatures can exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for an average of four to five days anytime from late April to mid-September and fall below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) for an average of 24.6 days in the winter. The highest temperature recorded in Edmonton was 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), on June 29, 1937. On July 2, 2013, a record high humidex of 44 was recorded, due to an unusually humid day with a temperature of 33.9 \u00b0C (93.0 \u00b0F) and a record high dew point of 23 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Edmonton was \u221249.4 \u00b0C (\u221256.9 \u00b0F), on January 19 and 21, 1886.Summer lasts from late June until early September, and the humidity is seldom uncomfortably high. Winter lasts from November to March and varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short and highly variable. Edmonton's growing season is from May 9 to September 22; it averages 135-140 frost-free days a year. At the summer solstice, Edmonton receives 17 hours and three minutes of daylight, with an hour and 46 minutes of civil twilight. On average Edmonton receives 2,299 hours of bright sunshine per year and is one of Canada's sunniest cities.The summer of 2006 was particularly warm for Edmonton, as temperatures reached 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) or higher more than 20 times from mid-May to early September. The winter of 2011\u201312 was particularly warm; from December 22, 2011, till March 20, 2012, on 53 occasions Edmonton saw temperatures at or above 0.0 \u00b0C (32.0 \u00b0F) at the City Centre Airport, and even warmer in the city proper.Edmonton has a fairly dry climate. On average, it receives 476.9 mm (18.78 in) of precipitation, of which 365.7 mm (14.40 in) is rain and 111.2 mm (4.38 in) is the melt from 123.5 cm (48.6 in) of snowfall per annum. Precipitation is heaviest in the late spring, summer, and early autumn. The wettest month is July, while the driest months are February, March, October, and November. In July the mean precipitation is 91.7 mm (3.61 in). Dry spells are not uncommon and may occur at any time of the year. Extremes do occur, such as the 114 mm (4.49 in) of rainfall that fell on July 31, 1953. Summer thunderstorms can be frequent and occasionally severe enough to produce large hail, damaging winds, funnel clouds, and occasionally tornadoes. Twelve tornadoes had been recorded in Edmonton between 1890 and 1989, and eight since 1990. An F4 tornado that struck Edmonton on July 31, 1987, killing 27, was unusual in many respects, including severity, duration, damage, and casualties. It is commonly referred to as Black Friday due both to its aberrant characteristics and the emotional shock it generated. Then-mayor Laurence Decore cited the community's response to the tornado as evidence that Edmonton was a \"city of champions,\" which later became an unofficial slogan of the city.A massive cluster of thunderstorms occurred on July 11, 2004, with large hail and over 100 mm (4 in) of rain reported within an hour in many places. This \"1-in-200 year event\" flooded major intersections and underpasses and damaged both residential and commercial properties. The storm caused extensive damage to West Edmonton Mall; a small glass section of the roof collapsed under the weight of the rainwater, causing water to drain onto the mall's indoor ice rink. As a result, the mall was evacuated as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nEdmonton is at the centre of Canada's sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA), which includes Edmonton and 34 other municipalities in the surrounding area. Larger urban communities include Sherwood Park (an urban service area within Strathcona County), the cities of St. Albert, Beaumont, Leduc, Spruce Grove and Fort Saskatchewan, and the towns of Stony Plain, Morinville, and Devon. Major employment areas outside Edmonton but within the CMA include the Nisku Industrial Business Park and the Edmonton International Airport (including a planned inland port logistics support facility in support of the Port Alberta initiative) in Leduc County, the Acheson Industrial Area in Parkland County, Refinery Row in Strathcona County and Alberta's Industrial Heartland within portions of Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County and Sturgeon County. Alberta's Industrial Heartland also extends beyond the CMA's northeastern boundary into Lamont County.The individual economic development interests and costs of service delivery in certain municipalities within the region have led to intermunicipal competition, strained intermunicipal relationships and overall fragmentation of the region. Although several attempts have been made by the City of Edmonton to absorb surrounding municipalities or annex portions of its neighbours, the city has not absorbed another municipality since the Town of Jasper Place joined Edmonton on August 17, 1964, and the city has not annexed land from any of its neighbours since January 1, 1982. After years of mounting pressure in the early 21st century, the Province of Alberta formed the Capital Region Board (CRB) on April 15, 2008. The CRB consists of 24 member municipalities \u2013 22 of which are within the Edmonton CMA and two of which are outside the CMA. The City of Edmonton announced in March 2013 its intent to annex 156 square kilometres of land (including the Edmonton International Airport) from Leduc County.On November 30, 2016, the City of Edmonton and Leduc County came to an agreement on Edmonton's annexation proposal. The City of Edmonton was poised to annex 29,900 acres (121 km2) of land from Leduc County and Beaumont, including the Edmonton International Airport, as a result.On January 1, 2019, the City of Edmonton officially annexed 8,260 ha (82.6 km2) from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont, increasing the city's area to 767.85 km2 (296.47 sq mi), with discussions of annexing an additional 2,830 ha (28.3 km2) of Edmonton International Airport land still ongoing.\n\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n\nEdmonton is divided into 375 neighbourhoods within 7 geographic sectors\u2014a mature area sector, which includes neighbourhoods that were essentially built out before 1970, and six surrounding suburban sectors.Edmonton's Downtown is within the city's mature area or inner city. It and the surrounding Boyle Street, Central McDougall, Cloverdale, Garneau, McCauley, Oliver, Queen Mary Park, Riverdale, Rossdale, Strathcona and University of Alberta form Edmonton's Central Core. Oliver and Garneau are the city's most populated and most densely populated neighbourhoods respectively. The mature area sector also contains the five former urban municipalities annexed by the city over its history: Beverly, Jasper Place, North Edmonton, Strathcona and West Edmonton (Calder).Larger residential areas within Edmonton's six suburban sectors, each comprising multiple neighbourhoods, include Heritage Valley, Kaskitayo, Riverbend, Terwillegar Heights and Windermere (southwest sector); The Grange, Lewis Farms and West Jasper Place (west sector); Big Lake (northwest sector); Castle Downs, Lake District and The Palisades (north sector); Casselman-Steele Heights, Clareview, Hermitage, Londonderry and Pilot Sound (northeast sector); and Ellerslie, The Meadows, Mill Woods and Southeast Edmonton (southeast sector). Mill Woods is divided into a town centre community (Mill Woods Town Centre) and eight surrounding communities: Burnewood, Knottwood, Lakewood, Millbourne, Millhurst, Ridgewood, Southwood, and Woodvale. Each has between two and four neighbourhoods.\n\nSeveral transit-oriented developments (TOD) have begun to appear along the LRT line at Clareview, with future developments planned at Belvedere (part of the Old Town Fort Road Redevelopment Project). Another TOD, Century Park, is being constructed at the site of what was once Heritage Mall, at the southern end of the LRT line. Century Park will eventually house up to 5,000 residents.The Edmonton City Centre Airport is planned to be redeveloped into a sustainable community of 30,000 people comprising a transit-oriented mixed use town centre, townhouses, low, medium and high rise apartments, neighbourhood retail and service uses, and a major park.Edmonton has four major industrial districts: the Northwest Industrial District, the Northeast Industrial District, the Southeast Industrial District, and the emerging Edmonton Energy and Technology Park, which is part of Alberta's Industrial Heartland. The northwest, northeast and southeast districts each have smaller industrial areas and neighbourhoods within them.The city has established 12 business revitalization zones: 124 Street and Area, Alberta Avenue, Beverly, Downtown, Chinatown and Little Italy, Fort Road and Area, Inglewood, Kingsway, North Edge, Northwest Industrial, Old Strathcona and Stony Plain Road.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of the City of Edmonton according to its 2019 municipal census is 972,223, a change of 8.1% from its 2016 municipal census population of 899,447. After factoring in dwellings that did not respond to the municipal census, Edmonton's population is further estimated to be 992,812. Per its municipal census policy, the city's next municipal census is scheduled for 2020.In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Edmonton recorded a population of 932,546 living in 360,828 of its 387,950 total private dwellings, a change of 14.8% from its 2011 population of 812,201. With a land area of 685.25 km2 (264.58 sq mi), it had a population density of 1,360.9/km2 (3,524.7/sq mi) in 2016.The 2016 municipal census captured more detailed demographic information on residents, including age and gender, marital status, employment status, length of residency, prior residence, employment transportation mode, citizenship, school residency, economic diversity, city resource access, highest educational attainment, household language and income, as well as dwellings and properties, including ownership, structure and status.In the 2011 Census, the City of Edmonton had a population of 812,201 living in 324,756 of its 348,672 total dwellings, a change of 11.2% from its 2006 population of 730,372. With a land area of 684.37 km2 (264.24 sq mi), it had a population density of 1,186.8/km2 (3,073.8/sq mi) in 2011. The census also reported that 50.2 percent of the population (407,325) was female while 49.8 percent (404,875) was male. The average age of the city's population was 36.0 years while there was an average 2.5 people per household.The Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) has the fifth-greatest population of CMAs in Canada and the second-greatest in Alberta, but has the largest land area in Canada. It had a population of 1,159,869 in the 2011 Census compared to its 2006 population of 1,034,945. Its five-year population change of 12.1 percent was second only to the Calgary CMA between 2006 and 2011. With a land area of 9,426.73 km2 (3,639.68 sq mi), the Edmonton CMA had a population density of 123.0/km2 (318.7/sq mi) in 2011. Statistics Canada's latest estimate of the Edmonton CMA population, as of July 1, 2016 is 1,363,300The Edmonton population centre is the core of the Edmonton CMA. This core includes the cities of Edmonton, Fort Saskatchewan and St. Albert, the Sherwood Park portion of Strathcona County, and portions of Parkland County and Sturgeon County. The Edmonton population centre, the fifth-largest in Canada, had a population of 960,015 in 2011, an 11.3 percent increase over its 2006 population of 862,544.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nAccording to the 2016 census, 55.8% of Edmonton's population were of European ethnicities, the most frequent of which included the English (16.8%), Scottish (13.8%), German (13.6%), Irish (12.5%), Ukrainian (10.8%), French (9.4%), and Polish (5.1%) origins. Other ethnic groups and origins included, among others:\nCanadian (17.4%);\nEast and Southeast Asian (15.9%) (7.4% Chinese, 6.2% Filipino, and 1.5% Vietnamese);\nSouth Asian (9.5%) (7.4% Indian));\nAboriginal (6.4% (4% First Nations and 2.7% M\u00e9tis);\nAfrican (6.1%);\nLatin, Central and South American (2.3%);\nWest Central Asian and Middle Eastern (4% (1.5% Lebanese); and\nCaribbean (1.4%).The 2016 census also reported that 37.1% of Edmonton's population identified themselves as visible minorities. The most frequent visible minorities included South Asian (9.5%), Chinese  (6.3%), Black (5.9%), Filipino (5.9%), and Arab (2.6%).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nEdmonton is home to members of a number of world religions. According to the 2011 Canadian Household Survey, 59.1 percent of metropolitan Edmonton residents identify as Christian. Significant religious minorities include Muslims (4.1 percent), Sikhs (1.8 percent), Buddhists (1.5 percent), Hindus (1.4 percent), Jewish people (0.3 percent), and practitioners of traditional Aboriginal spirituality (0.2 percent). Those belonging to smaller religions account for 0.5 percent, while 31.1 percent profess no religious affiliation.Within Christianity, major denominations include the Roman Catholic Church (44.4 percent of self-identified Christians) and the United Church (10.5 percent). Edmonton is home to four major cathedrals, with St. Joseph's Basilica seating the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton, All Saints' Cathedral seating the Anglican Diocese of Edmonton, St. Josaphat Cathedral seating the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and St. John Cathedral seating the Ukrainian Orthodox Eparchy of Western Canada. Additionally, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are served by the Edmonton Alberta Temple.\nIn the 1930s, the local Muslim community began organizing to build a mosque. A local Muslim woman, Hilwie Hamdon, met with the mayor to acquire the land, and campaigned to raise $5,000 for the building. In 1938, Abdullah Yusuf Ali was present at the opening of the new Al-Rashid Mosque, which became the first mosque established in Canada and the third in North America. In the 1980s, Muslim students at the University of Alberta found it difficult to rent prayer rooms large enough to accommodate the local population, and opened the Muslim Community of Edmonton as a mosque and outreach centre in 1992. From these beginnings, Muslims now form the city's largest religious minority, with 46,125 members (2011) representing over 62 ethnic backgrounds at over 20 Edmonton-area mosques (2019).Edmonton's Jewish community is represented by the Jewish Federation of Edmonton, operating the historic Edmonton Jewish Cemetery, purchased in 1907. The city contains six synagogues. The oldest, Beth Israel, was established in 1912 and served as home of Canada's first Jewish day school. Other Abrahamic religions active in Edmonton include the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, operating a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Centre in Norwood, and Druze, with its Canadian Druze Centre located in the Northwest Industrial District.\n\nEdmonton also hosts a Maronite Catholic church, on 76 Avenue/98 Street, with services in English on Saturdays and Arabic on Sundays. The Hindu Community in Edmonton is served by the Hindu Society of Alberta (North Indian Temple) and the Maha Ganapathy Society of Alberta (South Indian Temple). The Sikh community in Edmonton is served by four gurdwaras. Edmonton is also home to two of Alberta's five Unitarian Universalist congregations \u2013 the Unitarian Church of Edmonton and the Westwood Unitarian Congregation; the other three are located in Calgary, Lethbridge, and Red Deer.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEdmonton is the major economic centre for northern and central Alberta and a major centre for the oil and gas industry. As of 2014, the estimated value of major projects within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region was $57.8-billion, of which $34.4-billion are within the oil and gas, oil sands, and pipeline sectors.Edmonton traditionally has been a hub for Albertan petrochemical industries, earning it the nickname \"Oil Capital of Canada\" in the 1940s. Supply and service industries drive the energy extraction engine, while research develops new technologies and supports expanded value-added processing of Alberta's massive oil, gas, and oil sands reserves. These are reported to be the second-largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia.Much of the growth in technology sectors is due to Edmonton's reputation as one of Canada's premier research and education centres. Research initiatives are anchored by educational institutions such as the University of Alberta (U of A) as well as government initiatives underway at Alberta Innovates and Edmonton Research Park. The U of A campus is home to the National Institute for Nanotechnology.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Edmonton became a major financial centre, with both regional offices of Canada's major banks and locally based institutions opening. However, the turmoil of the late-1980s economy radically changed the situation. Locally based operations such as Principal Trust and Canadian Commercial Bank would fail, and some regional offices were moved to other cities. The 1990s saw a solidification of the economy, and Edmonton is now home to Canadian Western Bank, the only publicly traded Schedule I chartered bank headquarters west of Toronto. Other major financial institutions include ATB Financial, Servus Credit Union (formerly Capital City Savings), TD Canada Trust and Manulife Financial.Edmonton has been the birthplace of several companies that have grown to international stature. The local retail market has also seen the creation of many successful store concepts, such as The Brick, Katz Group, AutoCanada, Boston Pizza, Pizza 73, Liquor Stores GP (which includes Liquor Depot, Liquor Barn, OK Liquor, and Grapes & Grains), Planet Organic, Shaw Communications, Empire Design, Running Room, Booster Juice, Earl's, Fountain Tire and XS Cargo.Edmonton's geographical location has made it an ideal spot for distribution and logistics. CN Rail's North American operational facility is located in the city, as well as a major intermodal facility that handles all incoming freight from the port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia. In early 2020, CN Rail announced that it was closing its Montreal control centre and would eventually close its Vancouver control centre as well, with a goal to consolidate all of its control operations into Edmonton.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nEdmonton is home to several shopping malls and the largest mall in North America, West Edmonton Mall, which is also considered to be the 10th largest mall in the world. Other mentionable malls include Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre, Edmonton City Centre (a combination of the former Edmonton Centre and Eaton Centre malls), Southgate Centre, Kingsway Mall, Northgate Centre, Riverview Crossing, Londonderry Mall, and Mill Woods Town Centre.Edmonton also has many big box shopping centres and power centres. Some of the major ones include South Edmonton Common (North America's largest open air retail development), Mayfield Common, Westpoint, Skyview Power Centre, Terra Losa Centre, Oliver Square, Southpark Centre, The Meadows, Christy's Corner, Currents of Windermere, and Manning Village.In contrast to suburban centres, Edmonton has many urban retail locations. The largest of them all, Old Strathcona, includes many independent stores between 99 Street and 109 Street, on Whyte Avenue and in the surrounding area. In and around Downtown Edmonton, there are a few shopping districts, including the Edmonton City Centre mall, Jasper Avenue, and 104 Street. Near Oliver, 124 Street is home to a significant number of retail stores. Edmonton is the Canadian testing ground for many American retailers, such as Bath & Body Works and Calvin Klein.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\nMany events are anchored in the downtown Arts District, centred around Churchill Square (named in honour of Sir Winston Churchill). On the south side of the river, the University district and Whyte Avenue contain theatres, concert halls, and various live music venues. The centrepiece of the square builds a life-size bronze statue of Churchill, unveiled by Lady Soames on May 24, 1989. It is a copy of a statue by Oscar Nemon.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Francis Winspear Centre for Music opened in 1997 after years of planning and fundraising. Described as one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in Canada, it is home to the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and hosts a wide variety of shows every year. It seats 1,932 patrons and houses the $3-million Davis Concert Organ, the largest concert organ in Canada. Across 102 Avenue is the Citadel Theatre, named after The Salvation Army Citadel in which Joe Shoctor first started the Citadel Theatre Company in 1965. It is now one of the largest theatre complexes in Canada, with five halls, each specializing in different kinds of productions. In 2015 the Citadel Theatre also became home to Catalyst Theatre. On the University of Alberta grounds is the 2,534-seat Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, which had over a year of heavy renovations as part of the province's 2005 centennial celebrations. Both it and its southern twin in Calgary were constructed in 1955 for the province's golden jubilee and have hosted many concerts, musicals, and ballets. On the front of the building is a quote from Suetonius' Life of Augustus: \"He found a city built of brick \u2013 left it built of marble.\"\nThe Old Strathcona neighbourhood is home to the Theatre District, which holds the ATB Financial Arts Barns (headquarters of the Edmonton International Fringe Festival), The Walterdale Playhouse, and the Varscona Theatre (base of operations for several theatre companies, including Teatro la Quindicina, Shadow Theatre, Die-Nasty, Plane Jane Theatre, and Grindstone Theatre!). Edmonton was named cultural capital of Canada in 2007. The Ukrainian Dnipro Ensemble of Edmonton, along with other Ukrainian choirs such as the Ukrainian Male Chorus of Edmonton, helps preserve the Ukrainian musical culture within the parameters of the Canadian multicultural identity in Edmonton.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nEdmonton hosts several large festivals each year, contributing to its nickname, \"Canada's Festival City\". Downtown Edmonton's Churchill Square host numerous festivals each summer. The Works Art & Design Festival, which takes place from late June to early July, showcases Canadian and international art and design from well-known award-winning artists as well as emerging and student artists. The Edmonton International Street Performer's Festival takes place in mid-July and is the biggest of its kind in North America. The TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival takes place in late June and, along with Montreal, were the first jazz festivals in Canada.\n\nEdmonton's main summer festival is K-Days, formerly Klondike Days, Capital Ex and originally the Edmonton Exhibition. Founded in 1879, the Edmonton Exhibition was originally an annual fair and exhibition that eventually adopted a gold rush theme, becoming Klondike Days in the 1960s. Northlands, the operators, renamed the festival \"Edmonton's Capital Ex\" or \"Capital Ex\" in 2006. In 2012 Edmonton Northlands conducted a poll to rename the festival that resulted in changing the name to \"K-Days\".  The Canadian Finals Rodeo was held in Edmonton from 1974 to 2017, but moved to Red Deer in 2018 due to the closure of the Coliseum.The Edmonton International Fringe Festival, held in mid-August, is the largest fringe theatre festival in North America. Also in August Edmonton hosts the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, the fourth major folk festival in Canada. Other summer festivals in and around Edmonton include the Edmonton Heritage Festival, Taste of Edmonton, Chaos Alberta Festival, Interstellar Rodeo, Big Valley Jambore, Pigeon Lake Music Festival, Edmonton Rockfest, Edmonton International Reggae Jamboree Festival, Edmonton Blues Festival and Cariwest. Edmonton also hosts a number of winter festivals, one of the oldest being the Silver Skate Festival. Others are Flying Canoe Volant, Ice on Whyte and the Ice Magic Festival.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIn the city's early days, music was performed in churches and community halls. Edmonton has a history of opera and classical music performance; both have been supported by a variety of clubs and associations. Edmonton's first major radio station, CKUA, began broadcasting music in 1927. The city is a centre for music instruction; the University of Alberta began its music department in 1945, and MacEwan University opened a jazz and musical theatre program in 1980. Festivals of jazz, folk, and classical music are popular entertainment events in the city.The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra has existed under various incarnations since 1913. In 1952 the Edmonton Philharmonic and the Edmonton Pops orchestras amalgamated to form the 60-member modern version. The Orchestra performs at the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.The city also has a vibrant popular music scene, across genres including hip-hop, reggae, R&B, rock, pop, metal, punk, country and electronic. Notable past and present local musicians include Robert Goulet, Tommy Banks, Stu Davis, Tim Feehan, Cadence Weapon, Kreesha Turner, The Smalls, SNFU, Social Code, Stereos, Ten Second Epic, Tupelo Honey, Mac DeMarco, Shout Out Out Out Out, Psyche, Purity Ring, The Wet Secrets, Nuela Charles, Celeigh Cardinal, and Ruth B.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nThere are several key areas of nightlife in Edmonton. The most popular is the Whyte Avenue (82 Avenue) strip, between 109 Street and 99 Street; it has the highest number of heritage buildings in Edmonton, and bars, clubs, and restaurants throughout, but mostly west of Gateway Boulevard (103 Street). Once the heart of the town of Strathcona (annexed by Edmonton on February 1, 1912), it fell into disrepair during the middle of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, a coordinated effort to revive the area through a business revitalization zone produced an area rich with restored historical buildings and pleasant streetscapes. Its proximity to the University of Alberta has led to a high number of restaurants, pubs, trendy clubs, and retail and specialty shops. This area also has two independent movie theatres, the Garneau and Princess, as well as several live theatre, music, and comedy venues.Downtown Edmonton has undergone a continual process of renewal and growth since the mid-1990s. Many buildings were demolished during the oil boom, starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s, to make way for office towers. There have always been numerous pub-type establishments, hotel lounges, and restaurants. The past decade has seen a strong resurgence in more mainstream venues. Edmonton also has a high demand for pub crawl tours in the city. Various clubs are found along Edmonton's main street, Jasper Avenue. The Edmonton City Centre mall also houses a Landmark Cinemas movie theatre with nine screens. The nonprofit Metro Cinema shows a variety of alternative or otherwise unreleased films every week.\nWest Edmonton Mall holds several after-hour establishments in addition to its many stores and attractions. Bourbon Street has numerous eating establishments; clubs and casinos can also be found within the complex. Scotiabank Theatre (formerly known as Silver City), at the west end of the mall, is a theatre with 12 screens and an IMAX.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Parkland and environment ===\n\nEdmonton's river valley constitutes the longest stretch of connected urban parkland in North America, and Edmonton has the highest amount of parkland per capita of any Canadian city; the river valley is 22 times larger than New York City's Central Park. The river valley is home to various parks ranging from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities. This main \"Ribbon of Green\" is supplemented by numerous neighbourhood parks located throughout the city, to give a total of 111 km2 (27,400 acres) of parkland. Within the 7,400 ha (18,000 acres), 25 km (16 mi)-long river valley park system, there are 11 lakes, 14 ravines, and 22 major parks, and most of the city has accessible bike and walking trail connections. These trails are also part of the 235 km (146 mi) Waskahegan walking trail. The City of Edmonton has named five parks in its River Valley Parks System in honour of each of \"The Famous Five\".\n\nEdmonton's streets and parklands also contain one of the largest remaining concentrations of healthy American elm trees in the world, unaffected by Dutch elm disease, which has wiped out vast numbers of such trees in eastern North America. Jack pine, lodgepole pine, white spruce, white birch, aspen, mountain ash, Amur maple, Russian olive, green ash, basswood, various poplars and willows, flowering crabapple, Mayday tree and Manitoba maple are also abundant; bur oak, silver maple, hawthorn and Ohio buckeye are increasingly popular. Other introduced tree species include white ash, blue spruce, Norway maple, red oak, sugar maple, common horse-chestnut, McIntosh apple, and Evans cherry. Three walnut species \u2013 butternut, Manchurian walnut, and black walnut \u2013 have survived in Edmonton.Several golf courses, both public and private, are also located in the river valley; the long summer daylight hours of this northern city provide for extended play from early morning well into the evening. Golf courses and the park system become a winter recreation area during this season, and cross-country skiing and skating are popular during the long winter. Four downhill ski slopes are located in the river valley as well, two within the city and two immediately outside.\n\nThe Edmonton & Area Land Trust (EALT) is a charity focused on conserving natural areas in Edmonton and surrounding municipalities. Its first project in Edmonton was conserving Larch Sanctuary, via a 59-acre Conservation Easement with the City, straddling Whitemud Creek south of 23rd Avenue, and containing the only oxbow lake in the City. EALT works with many organisations in Edmonton, and is currently working to conserve the 233 acres of Forest and Farmland in a loop of the river in North East Edmonton.\nA variety of volunteer opportunities exist for citizens to participate in the stewardship of Edmonton's parkland and river valley. Volunteer programs include River Valley Clean-up, Root for Trees, and Partner in Parks.  River Valley Clean-up engages volunteers to pick up hundreds of bags of litter each year.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThere are many museums in Edmonton of various sizes.  The largest is the Royal Alberta Museum (RAM), which was formerly known as the Provincial Museum of Alberta until it was renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's 2005 Alberta centennial visit. The RAM houses over 10 million objects in its collection and showcases the culture and practices of the diverse aboriginal tribes of the region. In 2018, the building relocated from its location in Glenora to a new building in downtown on 103A Avenue and 97 Street. The museum held a grand opening event and gave out 40,000 free tickets for its first few days of operation.The Telus World of Science is located in the Woodcroft neighbourhood northwest of the city centre. It opened in 1984 and has since been expanded several times. It contains five permanent galleries, one additional gallery for temporary exhibits, an IMAX theatre, a planetarium, an observatory, and an amateur radio station.  The Edmonton Valley Zoo is in the river valley to the southwest of the city centre.The Alberta Aviation Museum, located in a hangar at the City Centre Airport, was built for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Its collection includes both civilian and military aircraft, the largest of which are a Boeing 737 and two CF-101 Voodoos. It also has one of only 3 BOMARC missiles in Canada.\n\nThe Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre is home to the Loyal Edmonton Regiment Military Museum. The museum is dedicated to preserving the military heritage and the sacrifices made by the people of Edmonton and Alberta in general. The museum features two galleries and several smaller exhibits. The collection includes historic firearms, uniforms, souvenirs, memorabilia, military accoutrements, as well as a large photographic and archival collection spanning the pre-World War One period to the present. The museum features an exhibit on the role of the 49th Battalion, CEF in Canada's Hundred Days Offensive.\nThe Telephone Historical Centre is a telephone museum also located in the Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre. In addition to a collection of artifacts tracing the history of the telephone, the museum has its own theatre featuring a brief film led by the robot Xeldon. As of April, 2019, the museum is permanently closed.The Alberta Railway Museum is located in the rural northeast portion of the city. It contains a variety of locomotives and railroad cars from different periods, and includes a working steam locomotive. Since most of its exhibits are outdoors, it is only open between Victoria Day and Labour Day.\n\nFort Edmonton Park, Canada's largest living history museum, is located in the river valley southwest of the city centre. Edmonton's heritage is displayed through historical buildings (many of which are originals moved to the park), costumed historical interpreters, and authentic artifacts. In total, it covers the region's history from approximately 1795 to 1929 (represented by Fort Edmonton), followed chronologically by 1885, 1905, and 1920 streets, and a recreation of a 1920s midway. A steam train, streetcars, automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles may be seen in operation (and utilized by the public) around the park. The John Walter Museum and Historical Area (c. 1875 to 1901) is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.  The University of Alberta operates its own internal Museums and Collections service.The Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is the city's largest single gallery. Formerly housed in an iconic 1970s Brutalist building designed by Don Bittorf, the AGA collection had over 5,000 pieces of art. The former AGA building was demolished in July 2007 to make way for construction of a new facility designed by Randall Stout. It was estimated to cost over $88-million and the amount that Edmonton City Council donated towards its construction was met with some controversy. The AGA officially opened on January 31, 2010. Commercial art galleries can be found throughout the city, especially along the 124 Street/Jasper Avenue corridor, known as the \"gallery walk\".Edmonton is home to four artist-run centres all located in the downtown core Harcourt House, Latitude 53, Ociciwan Contemporary Art Collective and Society of Northern Alberta Print-Artists (SNAP). The University of Alberta and MacEwan University also have galleries: the Fine Arts Building Gallery and the Mitchell Art Gallery, respectively. The University of Alberta Museums and Collections also has 17 million objects, 29 registered museum collections and occasional exhibitions.\n\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\n\nEdmonton has a number of professional sports teams, including the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League, and FC Edmonton of the Canadian Premier League. Junior sports clubs include the Edmonton Huskies and Edmonton Wildcats of the Canadian Junior Football League and the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League. Venues for Edmonton's professional and junior sports teams include Commonwealth Stadium (Eskimos), Argyll Velodrome, Rogers Place (Oilers and Oil Kings), Edmonton Ballpark (Prospects), the Universiade Pavilion (Energy), and Clarke Stadium (FC Edmonton, Huskies and Wildcats).\n\nEdmonton's teams have rivalries with Calgary's teams and games between Edmonton and Calgary teams are often referred to as the Battle of Alberta.\nPast notable hockey teams in Edmonton include: the original junior hockey incarnation of the Edmonton Oil Kings, with multiple league and national Memorial Cup championships playing in the Western Hockey League; the Edmonton Flyers, with multiple Lester Patrick Cups and one national Allan Cup, and; the Edmonton Roadrunners of the American Hockey League.  Other past notable sports teams include; the Edmonton Grads, a women's basketball team with 108 local, provincial, national, and international titles and the world champions for 17 years in a row; the Edmonton Trappers, a Triple-A level baseball team with multiple division and league titles in the Pacific Coast League, and; the Edmonton Rush, a box lacrosse team with one league championship.\nLocal university-level sports teams include the U of A Golden Bears, the U of A Pandas, the NAIT Ooks, and the MacEwan Griffins. Local amateur teams, among others, include the Edmonton Gold of the Rugby Canada Super League and two flat track roller derby leagues: Oil City Roller Derby and E-Ville Roller Derby.The Castrol Raceway hosts regular sprint car and a national IHRA events at their facility next to Edmonton International Airport. The airport also hosts horse racing at the Century Mile Racetrack and Casino.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, Edmonton hosted an annual circuit on the Indy Racing League known as the Edmonton Indy. Other past sporting events hosted by Edmonton include the 1978 Commonwealth Games, the 1983 World University Games (Universiade), the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, the 2002 World Ringette Championships, the 2005 World Master Games, the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup, the 2007 and 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and the CN Canadian Women's Open. Edmonton shared hosting duties with Calgary for the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Edmonton is one of the venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe Edmonton City Council consists of a mayor and twelve councillors serving four-year terms. Each councillor is elected in a ward (electoral district); the mayor is elected at-large. The elections are non-partisan. Council has the responsibility of approving the city's budget, and develops laws and policies intended to promote the health and safety of Edmonton residents. The Council passes all legislation related to the city's police, firefighting, parks, libraries, and electricity, water supply, solid waste, and drainage utilities.\nOn July 22, 2009, City Council adopted an electoral system that divides Edmonton into 12 wards, instead of the previous two for each of six wards. This system came into effect with the following election in October 2010. The most recent election was held in October 2017, and elected members to a four-year term.\n\n\n=== Provincial politics ===\n\nEdmonton is the capital of the province of Alberta and holds all main provincial areas of government such as the Provincial Legislature of Alberta. The Edmonton Metropolitan Region is represented by 20 MLAs, one for each provincial electoral district. Many of these boundaries have been changed, adjusted and renamed while the city has grown. In the current 30th Alberta Legislature nearly all of Edmonton's districts are represented by members from the Opposition Alberta New Democratic Party. One of the MLAs, Rachel Notley, is also the Leader of the Opposition.\n\n\n=== Federal politics ===\nEdmonton is represented by nine Members of Parliament (MP), with one being elected to represent each of its federal electoral districts. In the current 43rd Canadian Parliament, eight MPs are members of the Conservative Party of Canada, while the remaining MP is part of the New Democratic Party. After the 2019 federal election, Edmonton lacked elected representation in the federal government for the first time since 1980.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe city's police force, the Edmonton Police Service, was founded in 1892, and had approximately 1,400 officers in 2012. Edmonton experienced a decrease in crime in the 1990s, an increase in the early 2000s, and another downturn at the end of the decade.\n\nThe Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) had a crime severity index of 84.5 in 2013, which is higher than the national average of 68.7. Its crime severity index was the fifth-highest among CMAs in Canada behind Regina, Saskatoon, Kelowna and Vancouver. Edmonton had the fourth-most homicides in 2013 at 27.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nEdmonton is home to 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), the Regular Force army brigade group of Land Force Western Area of the Canadian Army. Units in 1 CMBG include Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), 1 Combat Engineer Regiment, two of the three regular force battalions of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and various headquarters, service, and support elements. Although not part of 1 CMBG, 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron and 1 Field Ambulance are located with the brigade group.  All of these units are located at Lancaster Park, immediately north of the city. From 1943, as CFB Namao (now CFB Edmonton/Edmonton Garrison), it was a major air force base.  In 1996, all fixed-wing aviation units were transferred to CFB Cold Lake.\nThe Canadian Airborne Training Centre had been located in the city in the 1980s. The move of 1 CMBG and component units from Calgary occurred in 1996 in what was described as a cost-saving measure. The brigade had existed in Calgary since the 1950s, and Lord Strathcona's Horse had traditionally been a Calgary garrison unit dating back to before World War I.\nEdmonton also has a large army reserve element from 41 Canadian Brigade Group (41 CBG), including The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (4th Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry); 41 Combat Engineer Regiment; HQ Battery, 20th Field Artillery Regiment; and B Squadron of The South Alberta Light Horse, one of Alberta's oldest army reserve units. Despite being far from Canada's coasts, Edmonton is also the home of HMCS Nonsuch, a naval reserve division. There are numerous cadet corps of the different elements (naval, army and air force) within Edmonton as well.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Aviation ====\n\nEdmonton is a major air transportation gateway to northern Alberta and northern Canada. The Edmonton International Airport (EIA) is the main airport serving the city.\nThe EIA provides passenger service to destinations in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The EIA is located within Leduc County, adjacent to the City of Leduc and the Nisku Industrial Business Park. With direct air distances from Edmonton to places such as London in United Kingdom being shorter than to other main airports in western North America, Edmonton Airports is working to establish a major container shipping hub called Port Alberta.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nEdmonton serves as a major transportation hub for Canadian National Railway, whose North American operations management centre is located at their Edmonton offices. It is also tied into the Canadian Pacific Railway network, which provides service from Calgary to the south and extends northeast of Edmonton to serve Alberta's Industrial Heartland.\nInter-city rail passenger rail service is provided by Via Rail's premier train, the Canadian, as it travels between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario. Passenger trains stop at the Edmonton railway station three days a week in both directions. The train connects Edmonton to multiple stops in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\n\nThe Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) is the city's public transit agency, operating the Edmonton Light Rail Transit (LRT) line as well as a fleet of buses. As of 2009 there were 354,440 boardings per day (in a population of 1,034,945). There are approximately 280,000 ETS bus boardings, 54,000 LRT boardings, and 3,500 paratransit boardings per weekday.From the 1990s to early 2009, Edmonton was one of two cities in Canada still operating trolley buses, along with Vancouver. On June 18, 2008, City Council decided to abandon the Edmonton trolley bus system and the last trolley bus ran on May 2, 2009.Scheduled LRT service began on April 23, 1978, with five extensions of the single line completed since. The original Edmonton line is considered to be the first \"modern\" light rail line in North America (i.e., built from scratch, rather than being an upgrade of an old system). It introduced the use of German-designed rolling stock that subsequently became the standard light rail vehicle of the United States. The Edmonton \"proof-of-payment\" fare collection system adopted in 1980 \u2013 modelled after European ticket systems \u2013 became the North American transit industry's preferred approach for subsequent light rail projects. The four-year South LRT extension was opened in full on April 24, 2010, which sees trains travelling to Century Park (located at 23 Avenue and 111 Street), making stops at South Campus and Southgate Centre along the way. A line to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in north-central Edmonton using the same high floor technology of the existing system opened September 6, 2015. Edmonton currently constructing the southeast leg of the Valley Line, which starts in Mill Woods and ends in the downtown core. The southeast portion is expected to open in 2021, after experiencing significant delays. Construction on the second and final phase of the Valley Line, which will extend the line west to Lewis Farms, is expected to commence in 2021. Unlike the Capital and Metro lines, trains on the Valley Line will utilize low-floor technology.\n\nA largely gridded system forms most of Edmonton's street and road network. The address system is mostly numbered, with streets running south to north and avenues running east to west. In built-up areas built since the 1950s, local streets and major roadways generally do not conform to the grid system. Major roadways include Kingsway, Yellowhead Trail (Highway 16), Whitemud Drive and Anthony Henday Drive.\nThe major roads connecting to other communities elsewhere in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan are the Yellowhead Highway to the west and east and Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway) to the south.\n\n\n==== Trail system ====\nEdmonton maintains over 160 kilometres (99 mi) of multi-use trails; however, most of this is within the river valley parkland system.\n\n\n=== Electricity and water ===\nEdmonton's first power company established itself in 1891 and installed streetlights along the city's main avenue, Jasper Avenue. The power company was bought by the Town of Edmonton in 1902 and remains under municipal ownership today as EPCOR. Also in charge of water treatment, in 2002 EPCOR installed the world's largest ultraviolet (UV) water treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) system at its E. L. Smith Water Treatment Plant.\n\n\n=== Waste disposal ===\n\nThe Edmonton Composting Facility, the largest of its type in the world, is also the largest stainless steel building in North America. Among the innovative uses for the city's waste includes a Christmas tree recycling program. The trees are collected each January and put through a woodchipper; this material is used as an addition to the composting process. In addition, the wood chips absorb much of the odour produced by the compost by providing a biofilter element to trap odour causing gaseous results of the process. The composting facility was permanently shut down in 2019 after an inspection found that the structural integrity of its roof was compromised.  Edmonton is currently operating a pilot project for organics waste collection, with approximately 8,000 households in thirteen different neighbourhoods participating.Together, the Waste Management Centre and Wastewater Treatment plant are known as the Edmonton Waste Management Centre of Excellence. Research partners include the University of Alberta, the Alberta Research Council, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, and Olds College.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nThere are four main hospitals serving Edmonton: University of Alberta Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital, Misericordia Community Hospital, and Grey Nuns Community Hospital. Other area hospitals include Sturgeon Community Hospital in St. Albert, Leduc Community Hospital in Leduc, Westview Health Centre in Stony Plain, and Fort Saskatchewan Community Hospital in Fort Saskatchewan. Dedicated psychiatric care is provided at the Alberta Hospital. The Northeast Community Health Centre offers a 24-hour emergency room with no inpatient ward services. The University of Alberta Hospital is the centre of a larger complex of hospitals and clinics located adjacent to the university campus which comprises the Stollery Children's Hospital, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Cross Cancer Institute, Zeidler Gastrointestinal Health Centre, Ledcor Clinical Training Centre, and Edmonton Clinic. Several health research institutes, including the Heritage Medical Research Centre, Medical Sciences Building, Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, and Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, are also located at this site. A similar set-up is also evident at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, which is connected to the Lois Hole Hospital for Women and Orthopaedic Surgery Centre. All hospitals are under the administration of Alberta Health Services, although Misericordia and Grey Nuns are run separately by Covenant Health.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary ===\nEdmonton has three publicly funded school boards (districts) that provide kindergarten and grades 1\u201312. The vast majority of students attend schools in the two large English-language boards: Edmonton Public Schools, and the separate Edmonton Catholic School District. Also, since 1994, the Francophone minority community has had their own school board based in Edmonton, the Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 2, which includes surrounding communities. The city also has a number of public charter schools that are independent of any board. All three school boards and public charter schools are funded through provincial grants and property taxes.\nSome private schools exist as well, including Edmonton Academy, Progressive Academy and Tempo School.Edmonton Public Schools is known for pioneering the concept of site-based decision making (decentralization) in Canada, which gives principals the authority, the financial resources and the flexibility to make decisions based on the individual needs of their schools. This initiative has led to Edmonton Public offering an school of choice model in which students have more options as to what school they want to attend to suit their interests, and has led to the creation of alternative programs such as Vimy Ridge Academy, Old Scona Academic and Victoria School of the Arts. The Edmonton Society for Christian Education and Millwoods Christian School (not part of the former) used to be private schools; however, have both also become part of Edmonton Public Schools as alternative programs.Both the Edmonton Public Schools and the Edmonton Catholic School District provide support and resources for those wishing to homeschool their children.\n\n\n=== Post-secondary ===\n\nThose post-secondary institutions based in Edmonton that are publicly funded include Concordia University of Edmonton, MacEwan University, King's University, NorQuest College, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) and the University of Alberta (U of A). The publicly funded Athabasca University also has a campus in Edmonton.The U of A is a board-governed institution that has an annual revenue of over one billion dollars. In 2011/12, the university had over 38,000 students enrolled within nearly 400 undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, as well as over 15,000 students enrolled in its faculty of extension. The U of A is also home to the second-largest research library system in Canada.In 2010/11, MacEwan University had a total student population of over 43,000 students, including nearly 14,000 full-time students, enrolled in programs offering bachelor's degrees, university transfers, diplomas and certificates. NAIT has an approximate total of 61,200 students enrolled in more than 200 programs while NorQuest College has approximately 8,500 students enrolled in various full-time, part-time and continuing education programs.Other post-secondary institutions within Edmonton include Newman Theological College, Taylor University College and Seminary and Yellowhead Tribal College, a First Nations college.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nEdmonton has seven local broadcast television stations shown on basic cable TV or over-the-air, with the oldest broadcasters in the city being CTV (1961) and CBC (1954).  Most of Edmonton's conventional television stations have made the switch to over-the-air digital broadcasting. The cable television providers in Edmonton are TELUS (for IPTV) and Shaw Cable. Twenty-one FM and eight AM radio stations are based in Edmonton.Edmonton has two large-circulation daily newspapers, the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun.  The Journal, established in 1903 and owned by the Postmedia Network, has a daily circulation of 112,000, while the Sun, established in 1978 and owned by Sun Media, has a circulation of 55,000. The Journal no longer publishes a Sunday edition as of July 2012.Metro, Edmonton's only free daily newspaper, ceased printing on December 20, 2019. The magazine Vue Weekly, a weekly publication which focused on alternative news, was published in Edmonton from 1995-2018. The Edmonton Examiner is a citywide community-based paper also published weekly. There are also a number of smaller weekly and community newspapers.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n\nEdmonton has five sister cities, with one American city listed by Sister Cities International. Edmonton was Nashville's first sister city and in 2015, the cities celebrated the 25th anniversary of their partnership. In 2014 and 2015, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean visited Edmonton during the Canadian Country Music Awards and the Edmonton Folk Music Festival. At the Folk Festival, Mayor Dean addressed the crowd of 20,000 and together with civic and arts leaders, celebrated the 25th anniversary of our sister city twinning. In August 2015, more than 150 Canadians visited Nashville to attend native son Brett Kissel's Grand Ole Opry debut and to meet with Sister Cities representatives. In November 2015, Doug Hoyer and Jeremy Witten represented Edmonton at World of Friendship, Nashville's annual sister cities celebration.\n Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, since 1967\n Harbin, China, since 1985\n Nashville, Tennessee, United States, since 1990\n Wonju, South Korea, since 1998\n Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, since 2013\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cities in Alberta\nList of communities in Alberta\nList of mayors of Edmonton\nList of people from Edmonton\nList of tallest buildings in Edmonton\nEdmonton Federation of Community Leagues\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

          "I grew up going to this Zoo and volunteered here to prepare for veterinary school. In that time I helped to care for animals, including Lucy who had a friend with her at the time that was moved. I would like to see the zoo used as an animal rehabilitation centre and sanctuary",
          "It was amazing to see the different animals that are there now vs the Calgary zoo and see Lucy and the zebras",
          "I love well-designed zoos that are working to prevent species extinction and this one is a relatively modest size, but well run and well worth your time.",

          "Pretty poor overall. Not many varieties of animals one would expect in a ZOO. What are sheep, chickens, rabbits and goats doing in a zoo? Domestic cat in a display? After being in zoos in San Diego, Kamloops, Portland and Calgary this doesn't hold a candle.",
          "Took my grandson to visit on a day when I think every school in Edmonton was visiting. There was no direction. CHAOS!! You had to avoid some unmannerly children. But without this, while walking around, met many workers who did not smile, say HELLO, ask if we were enjoying it.",
          "I took my grandson to the zoo and we both had a great time. The walkways were a bit slippery because it was almost spring and there was still now on the ground but we had fun wandering around to both the outdoor areas and the indoor places. teh monkeys were fun, the birds were",
          "Our visit to the zoo was awesome. The staff were great and they have done such a great job for a little zoo, who received very little outside funding. Right in our own city it is a honour to have such a valuable asset. Lovely displays and easy to get around.",
          "This is a terrible zoo. Don\u2019t waste your time or money. We were so excited for a trip to the zoo with the family and were extremely disappointed. Everything was under construction and there were no exhibits available, we were not notified and paid pull price to see birds and",

          "Wow. Came here looking to see exotic animals. Most of the cages were vacant with signs on them. Construction workers with gas powered tillers and jackhammers were extremely loud. We couldn't even hear ourselves talk! Souvenir shop is cheap and tacky with overpriced garb",
          "I feel that when most of the cages are empty and the animals are not there the admission should be less.

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Edmonton Valley Zoo. It offered a wide variety of animals for a zoo of its size. It was possible to see most of the animals up close. The viewing areas allowed our 2-year-old to see animals without having to be lifted up. The animals",

          "I recently paid a visit to the Valley Zoo after not having been there since I was a child and I was very impressed by their updates. The zoo's paths are easily navigable and feature many interesting sights. All of the animals that were accessible for viewing were relatively easy",

          "We arrived early in the morning to beat the crowds. What a wonderful way to spend a day. Each exhibit is very clean, the animals all look very healthy and relaxed, and the entire location is well kept and very informative. We really enjoyed Lucy the elephant!",
          "Be aware there is a lot of construction going on right now. On the plus side it looks like they're really trying to build a new and amazing zoo here. There are a lot of great animals here (elephant, red pandas, camels, etc..) which I wouldn't have expected in a relatively small",
          "I nice way to spend a morning or afternoon. It wasn't too expensive to get in compared to other city attractions. They are in the middle of renovations, but the parts they have completed have a nice modern feel to it. We spent 3 hours and were able to walk around the whole zoo.",
          "Very small zoo for the amount of money you pay. Most of it was under construction. Couldn't find Lucy the elephant and there was wasps everywhere. Very disappointing. Don't bother and save your money.",
          "Beautiful facility. Fun event. Most days it is great for families but Zoo Brew is an adult only function.",
          "The parking lot was a mess, not paved and people were parking all sorts of ways. We arrived on a Sunday morning (11am) and could not find any parking (parked at nearby park). The admission is fairly cheap but considering the size of the zoo, it was no surprise. The animals were",
          "The zoo is small, and I find it hard to get around. Not many cool animals, except for Lucy.. if you can find her.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised when I walked up to the gates. Only 14 dollars to wander around the zoo. Lots of upgrades have been taking place. You might not see lions or some other big game but you will see sea lions and red pandas. It gives you something else to enjoy while you",
          "A small, but lovely zoo full of great animals. The elephant walk was really something that made our entire visit at the zoo. While not easy to get to by public transport - particularly on a Sunday. It was a good day out overall.",
          "We had a great time at the Edmonton Zoo, went in the morning so the animals were active, Lucy put on her show which was fun, they have lots of inter-active things for the kids to do - not to big it was a chore for us old folks, over all we really liked it, the ice cream was",
          "We really enjoyed this medium sized zoo. Loved the fact that there were lots of places in the shade to sit and rest. We were entertained by the red pandas especially the one that tried to make it's escape up the stairs out the door following the handler. Find the food",
          "We didn't arrive till 4 o'clock and they close at 5. We were able to stay on the property till 6. No crowds. We did miss out on any bird shows but got to see the Elephant out for a daily walk. It was clean The map was a bit confusing, wishing there was a picture of the",
          "My friend and I visited this zoo while on a weekend girl\u2019s trip. We were very unimpressed with it. Nothing spectacular to make it worth the cost. But I\u2019m sure for locals, it\u2019s appreciated; just wouldn\u2019t waste my time or money to visit again during a vacation.",
          "Had a great evening at the zoo with the food trucks there but stayed for a few hours which was great, as seniors had not been for quite a while but found it excellent even with the Large crowd. We will go back soon and spend a half day but families expect to stay most of the",
          "Small but great lots of interactive and free play areas for kids. Easy for families to navigate and enjoy without feeling like it\u2019s huge and can\u2019t see it all. There is a few cool areas for kids to free play and my kids favourite is the Little stream area that has rock and they",
          "This a a small zoo tucked into the river valley on the north side of river. It is great for young children who could get close to these animals. Lucy , the elephant is one of the eldest residents. It is not large which is great for small children and families.",
          "The animals are usually hiding. Theres not much to look at or see. Nothing compared to the Calgary Zoo where there is lots! But the kids had fun so I gave it 3 stars.",
          "Going on a weekday in May was the perfect time. The weather was actually hot and sunny, and it was nice standing under the trees for shade, while looking at the exhibits. The upper hill side didn't have much shade though (mountain goat area). Nice that there was a concession",
          "The space that these animals live in is too small. The elephant has no water to soak or play in and the 'barn' is concrete and very little room for the elephant to move around. Until they invest some money in EVZ to make the animals feel freer I won't be back and won't recommend",
          "Get a membership or a naturally Edmonton pass for best value. Year round experiences... The animals are very playful in cooler weather. Many places to warm up or have a snack. We love the new sections, play space and Edventure Lodge. Open front area has coffee shop and can be",
          "I only visited to show my children how sad animals in captivity are, and there are plenty of examples at the valley zoo. The bird enclosures are heart breakingly tiny, none of the animals have the right colouring or any energy or joy. And then there's Lucy. The absolute pride",
          "I took my grandkids here and they didn\u2019t like it. They didn\u2019t like animals being in cages and the elephant has such a small space to move around. Why do we have an African elephant where it is so cold? She looked so sad.",
          "we went during open house day. aside for being crowded.. thats normal as it was free, there was no animals!!!!! instead of seeing zebras there was a guy standing infant showing its skin! kids were terrified. I understand the importance of showing it to kids and have them touch",
          "We visited the zoo in both December and January. We visited at night in December for their Luminaria event. It was very cold, but fun and a great event to get into the Christmas spirit. They have so many beautiful light displays, some even coordinated to music. They also have a",
          "Went to the zoo yesterday with family and have never been so disappointed or disgusted with the zoo. Construction everywhere and more than half of the cages/ pens/ enclosures were empty. My granddaughters that normally love zoos were very quickly bored with this one as they",
          "We go to the Valley Zoo many times a year and love to check in on our favourite animals and birds. It is a beautiful setting for a family walk and very educational",
          "We have been there many times over the years. We went specifically to see the kimodo dragons who were temporarily house there. Very interesting! Walked around a bit as well but was hampered by the onsite construction. Hopefully it will be completed soon so the venue can be",
          "I went with my parents, wife, sister, and kids with less than one year old. The zoo in some spots was nice, others spots were a bit old. But for an overall, we enjoyed the visit and the walk. Is a visit you can do in Edmonton, taking in account that is something different to do.",
          "The zoo is boring, old and crumbly. The cages are very small for some of the animals and especially the elephant\u2019s cage is way too small for such a creature. This zoo is well past it\u2019s prime and they should just shut it down.",
          "Here everyone may enjoy watching and strolling to various animal and small nature reserves. There is also a train ride to jug along in. Snacks are readily available.",
          "Depressing place. They keep a lone female elephant here, even over the winter, and handle her with bull hooks. Spend your money somewhere.",
          "Had the pleasure of attending the Zoominesence Festival on Xmas eve. Even at -26 a great time and worth braving the cold. Such a great event and grounds were beautiful. It was very cool that lots of the animals had been given Christmas trees in their enclosures and some like the",
          "I am very disappointed in Trip Advisor for recommending this zoo I went once upon arriving in Edmonton and will never go back. This is no more than a roadside circus! To call this a zoo is an insult to reputable zoos. The elephant, Lucy is the only one left in Canada because",
          "It was about -20 when we visited, but the zoo has a really good mix of indoor and outdoor exhibits, so we did quick hits on the outdoor animals and retreated to the indoor areas to warm up. For the first hour we had the zoo pretty much to ourselves. Highlights were the Arctic",
          "Likes the old Zoo better but hey...that's just me. Didn't see too many animals...even the Elephant was hiding. Perhaps when all the construction is completed this will be a better zoo to check out. In the meantime I will wait before going back.",
          "The Zoo is ever changing and ever popular with all ages. It is great exercise walking between venues, and there is a wide range of exhibits.",
          "Its both a wonderful study of animals as well as nature. Lovely gardens and flowers with water fountains along the way.",
          "This zoo is not particularly large and there was major construction underway during my visit (September 2017). There is adequate free parking. Not a bad way to kill a couple of hours if you are in the neighborhood.",
          "I go here a few times a year to entertain my little ones. Never too busy so you get a good look at whatever you want. They are always improving.",
          "very nice zoo. lots of walking , very little animals to see. I give this zoo a 5 out of 10.the up grades make this zoo nice ,,but they lack great animals.",
          "We went to the zoo while visiting Edmonton. It happened to be on the day it was free to the public. Very busy. Somewhat disapointed but could just have been the day we were there. The one Elephant was not available for viewing and some other animals were inside - not in their",
          "Great place to visit the site of animals and take a lot of animals in the zoo For a zoo festivals thanks again",
          "I took my grandchild to the zoo in the late afternoon. He LOVES the train. I was told the zoo was open until 5:00 but the rides and pavilions would close at 4, including he train. It was 3:30 so I paid the fair - half an hour was enough time for at least one ride......NOT. We",
          "We got there for free so I couldn't ask for more using our Leisure Access Program pass. My son enjoyed the Farm animals the most. There were lots of renovations going on during the time of our visit otherwise I would have given a perfect score. The food truck close to the train",
          "It's a zoo. It's about average in terms of zoos. It has some neat features and a nice way to spend 2-3 hours with the family.",
          "My girlfriend and I came to this place a summer ago. We were very impressed with the types of wildlife that inhabit its grounds. Lucy the Elephant fame we encountered from a few hundred feet away from were we were standing. what a gem of a massive creature. A well disciplined",
          "We were told not to get our hopes up after visiting the Calgary Zoo. But I was quite impressed with this \"little\" zoo! Plus, they have an elephant! And that trumps all for me!",
          "I took my stepdaughter and her friend here for their Pajama Party... Despite the weather (rain), we had a blast! There was face painting, Paw Patrol Mascots, and a few rides. The only thing I would suggest is that when they have events like this geared towards kids, they should",
          "It was pretty cool though the elephant was in hiding (how you hide an elephant I'm not sure, but she was no where to be seen!) We went the day of the solar eclipse and the staff was SO prepared! They all had at least one pair of \"glasses\" so guests could look at the sun which",
          "It's always fun to play tourist in my home town. Since I hadn't been to the zoo for years, off I went on a lovely, sunny Sunday. There are wide pathways with lots of room for strollers, walkers and wheelchairs. The atmosphere is relaxed - stop and listen to one of the staff,",
          "There aren't many animals here and the ones that are there seem to be in poor condition. The birds of prey are in the smallest cages I gave ever seen, it's criminal! All the animals areas are much to small. I saw fixes and wolves and tigers pacing, a sure sign of zoochosis (the",
          "Read some negative reviews about the zoo so was a little worried. What we found was a modern and clean zoo. Great price and free parking close to entrance. Grandchildren loved the paddle boats and the petting zoo (getting a little old for it now) but the highlight of the day had",
          "Was a quick 2 hour trip. The train ride was 2 mins at most. Went behind the animals and didn't get to see much. A big part of the zoo was under construction, so it was a quick visit. My daughter enjoyed it. Will be great when it is all done!!",
          "We found this zoo to be pretty small. Which can be a good thing or a bad thing. I am 34 weeks pregnant so walking it was good, if it was too big I'm not sure I could have lasted. It is very clean, minus all the construction going on around. Would definitely recommend for small",
          "The structure is nice but there were barely few animals to view, wished there were more but overall its a nice zoo",
          "I like to visit the Edmonton Valley Zoo with my family(s) since it is a nice relaxing place for an afternoon stroll, and its not so busy. It is a win/win situation knowing that my dollars are going to be used wisely to support and grow the local community zoo, and my young",
          "I have been to this too many times. This time my fiance her sister and her kids all went to see the Komodo dragons. Of course we spent another 3 hours walking around looking at the other exhibits as well be family friendly had a very. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting",
          "Most of the animals here you can see if you drive down highway 2. The arctic zone had a seal......just a seal. They didn't even have moose or deer so actually you will see more on highway 2. Elephants only make an appearance at certain times ( not during our 2.5 hour visit)",
          "It was a waste of time and money. hardly any animals available to view. An ice cream and donuts stand that was sold out of donuts and most of the ice cream by noon.",
          "I went to the Valley Zoo today to see what it was about. Overall I would say it was good. Would be very good for little kids as it is not too big but still lots for the little ones to see and do. Older kids and teens, not so much. The price was good for what you get and as I",
          "It was a hot day when we went and we managed to find many big trees to rest at. My sons loved it, especially Lucy the elephant. There was construction going on which is a pain but understandable as the whole zoo is getting upgraded, the snack building is closed for a new",
          "It was crappy and small, and not worth the money, when I went with my BFF years ago. I hear there's renovations going on, so hopefully it gets better!",
          "There is still a lot of construction going on at Edmonton's once little zoo. There are a lot of changes and improvements. I have been coming to the zoo since 1980 and find the changes refreshing and definitely needed. They are doing a great job. The enclosures are looking better",
          "We were never told there was construction in the zoo or the main food court was closed due to the construction. We spent more time looking for food (the map was terrible) than we did looking at animals. Some of the enclosures were too small for the animals and some areas had not",
          "Lot of animals were so Sad, maybe the heat is affecting most of them, there was lot of maintenance and closed parts of the zoo.",
          "This zoo is small, but well kept. The animals looked well care for and loved. I am by no means a zoologist, but the living quarters for the animals seemed so small, especially for the elephant. In saying that you could tell that this place truly cares about their animals, and",
          "When for a stroll at the zoo. The merkaba were completely photogenic ...then realised the cats across from them were being fed and that's why they seembed so interested in us! But they're adorable anyways..I will was a lovely day and a great way to get a little exercise in. The",
          "I have lived here most of my life and visited this zoo many times over the years with my children and by myself. They have done considerable upgrading to keep it in great condition and it is a pleasure to visit. I would like to see more food to eat options than are currently",
          "Came with my 2 kids and had a fab time! The staff were very friendly and informative! I liked to read the signs and learn about the animals! Kids loved the zoo train, merry-go-round, and petting zoo! They are all sanitary and safe! The Zoo-tique was so awesome! They have poo",
          "This zoo has gone through some excellent updates over the years. The new zoo is well laid out and as interactive as possible. As you can see from the title I have a thing for red pandas...but besides the pandas the entire zoo is well done. The animals are well cared for and the",
          "Awesome tourist attraction.. love coming here with friends and looking at all the animals and enjoying the nice weather",
          "The zoo has a bunch of exhibits and areas that are in the process of being updated and renovated. Visitors should be aware that some of the animals may not be out for viewing. We visited with a 2 year old that loved it! This small zoo is focused towards toddler and preschool",
          "Good small zoo to visit with young kids and get them walking. Quite a few animals to see. I would recommend getting a family pass if you live in Edmonton. We visited there so many times while we lived in Edmonton it was well worth the money.",
          "Upon arrival we were quite impressed with the new entrance with restaurant and gift shop. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. We could hardly see any animals and when we could see them the enclosures were disgustingly small. Many enclosures had closed for the season",
          "The Edmonton zoo is a great family outing. It is well laid out. Free train ride. Free merry go round. Lots of the things kids can interact with and see. Let be the water spouts before entering park. Great after wards for the kids on a hot day. Cost is very reasonable for a",
          "Perfect place to take the family. Well kept flora and fauna, lots of children's activities. For city raise kids who've never seen wildlife, this is a must summer attraction. Great for Birthday parties too.",
          "I was excited to go to the zoo this week end to escape city stress. I was there today. I saw very few animals. Most cages were empty. Animals seemed sad. Really disappointed ! Edmonton needs to work hard in terms of attractions and tourism in general.",
          "The zoo is pretty small but it's also cheap to get into so I didn't feel like it was a rip-off. There are lots of animals, unfortunately it was difficult to see some of them. It was a nice little wander round though, for a good afternoon.",
          "Low priced fun. Good family trip. Animals were exciting to see. Food could be better but as expected. Overall very happy with visit",
          "Kids loved the train ride! The petting zoo is great for small children. Paddle boats were fun. The variety of animals wasn't huge, but there was a lot to see.",
          "Nice place to spend a sunny day with kids and family. Must say an adventurous trip. Must see in edmonton.",
          "We booked a group tour for adults with disabilities. They were awesome. We had the opportunity to hold and touch certain animals where it was quiet away from all the other people. The lady was very informative and made it an enjoyable experience for everyone. The enclosures were",
          "Would of been nice to have more animals to view also not so spread out before u see another animal also having other showings",
          "Walked through the zoo on a fabulous day...all the animals were out enjoying the sun. Great expansion plans...will definitely go more often!",
          "Storyland vally zoo is a great place to take kids. Some of the animals are located in a story atmosphere, such as\"three little pigs\".",
          "It is nice to be able to get so close to Lucy the elephant. A zoo is a place where one can go for a walk and feel like you are in many other countries with all the different animals.",
          "The animal enclosures are quite small. Some of animals were pacing a lot like they were upset. There is absolutely no room for the elephant, who seemed like it was lonely to not have a companion. I would contend that if the zoo can't provide adequate room and companionship for",
          "The Edmonton Zoo can be a very enjoyable day out with the kids as long as you keep in mind this is a facility in transition. The Zoo is geared to smaller children and offers a pleasant walk around the exhibits, paddle boats, carrousel rides, petting area, and a rubber-tired",
          "The area around the zoo provides for scenic and well groomed picnic areas. We attended a very large family affair here and were impressed with the area. Be prepared for a slight walk because of selected parking areas only.",
          "Edmonton has done a lot to this zoo over the last few years and it's a very nice visit for all ages. My daughter especially like the petting zoo. Oh, and not forgetting Lucy the elephant, she adores her. The staff are super friendly and always willing to stop and chat.",
          "We were here in November while visiting our grandchildren and had the place almost to ourselves. It was cold but if you were dressed warm it was fine. There are a couple buildings to go into to warm up, one that houses the elephant and one that has monkeys, kangaroos and lots of",
          "We had a great time, lots of animals and the elephant walking about was neat . The otters were our favorites so playful!",
          "I am a local REALTOR in Edmonton. We rented the Valley Zoo for a Client Appreciation Party. We had the Valley Zoo for our own private use between 6:30 pm and 9:30 pm with an \"Elephant Talk\" at 7:30 pm. Lucy (the elephant) made a painting while we got to find out about her.",
          "My family and I spent our last full day in Alberta at the Valley Zoo in Edmonton. It's a cute little zoo! It's not huge by any means (but we are used to the massive Metro Toronto Zoo), but it was a great few hours spent in the wonderful weather. We even got to see their resident",
          "We've been here a few times over the past couple years. Understand when you come this isn't the Calgary zoo or any of the big ones south of the boarder, but it entertains the kids and Lucy the elephant can often be seen walking around with her handlers free of cages or ropes.",
          "This is such a nice zoo. Very friendly staff and lots of nice animals to look at. I love visiting here.",
          "I took my 6 year old Grandson to the Valley Zoo in June. It is not a large Zoo but we had a good time. My Grandson loved climbing on the igloo he could see around the Zoo he said. The highlight was when some of the animals were taken for walks around the Zoo. The elephant",
          "Really enjoyed taking my grandchildren there and show them exotic animals and let the learn how they survive and live. We were able to ride on a little train that went around most of the exhibits. All in all , a great place to take a family!",
          "The Valley Zoo is a great way to spend a day with your children, grandchildren,friends or by yourself! Been visiting the zoo since I was a child and it's much better now then ever. Love taking my grandchild and making it a whole day adventure of it. Hopefully she enjoys as much",
          "The zoo as a display of animals is so so. But as a family activity with many programs, interactive events and social programs - it is very good. Highly recommend their Christmas lights and Halloween event.",
          "compared to other zoos which we have visited it is not as nice or have the same variety of animals, but it is in a pretty harsh winter climate which i think is why. we prefer the zoo in calgary.",
          "The animals they had available were all tucked away, or unavailable. There was a lot of construction on the place. What we were able to see was nice however. It would have been even better to have known they were under construction. Its a smaller zoo, but the facility is clean",
          "nice to take your kids out for a day but not what you expect for a zoo in the capital of AB where you are close to the mountains and all this wild life, could be rated as 2 stars in comparison to world class zoos.",
          "The only zoo in Edmonton it is. Haven't been too so many zoo before so i found it really good one. Many birds, animals, reptiles you can see there. I am also happy that they take care of these animals well. You definitely need more time to visit this place. Tickets are available",
          "I absolute love this zoo! Although the zoo is rather small it had a lot of different animals that you wouldn't be able to see at the Calgary Zoo. Admission is only $14 for an adult and parking is so far free... Whereas, if you were to go to Calgary Zoo it is $23 for admission",
          "Zoos are always interesting. In my opinion. This is no different for Edmonton's. That being said, it is a work in progress. Lots of improvement happening and more to come. It can use some TLC.",
          "I went to visit the zoo with my niece and nephews and we enjoyed it immensely. It's best to go there, of course during summer, so that you can see all the animals.",
          "A beautiful zoo working hard to introduce children to various animals that need their help. Unfortunately, they have done away with the Storyland aspect but still love it!",
          "We took our 2 year old grand daughter there on Sunday and she liked it very much. She really enjoyed the Train, the merry go round and the petting zoo. She was able to see Lucy outside on the lawn and she liked her as well. She was also enjoyed the seals as they swam by her. It",
          "In Alberta there are two main zoos. The Valley Zoo in Edmonton and The Calgary Zoo in Calgary. If given the choice as a resident of Edmonton, I'd go to the Calgary Zoo long before I'd choose to go to the Valley Zoo. The Valley Zoo is in some desperate need of upgrades. The",
          "The most terrible zoo I have visited ever. Zoo are already terrible for animals but that one was terrible and heart breaking. Its cheap, half the cages were empty or with barely any animals in. Food was terrible. Do the trip and drive to Calagry zoo if you want to go somewhere",
          "The Valley zoo is totally a kids zoo only! There aren't a lot of animals to see and the zoo is fairly small, plus the admission isn't cheap either. You are much better off going to the Calgary Zoo!",
          "For anyone who has been to a big zoo, like the one in Calgary or Vancouver, you might not think too much of the Edmonton Valley Zoo. But it's still a cute little zoo, and offers its own kind. We had train ride and merry-go-round for the kids, pony rides, and different shows and",
          "Enjoyable.. Elephant wasn't there but good none the less.. Clean and interesting with a wide variety of animals",
          "Ok so this zoo is smaller than Calgary but it deserves 5 stars. Calgary zoo is to big (sorry) for small families!!!! This Edmonton zoo simple, manageable and sweet. Families can relax and enjoy this zoo in a few hours--not stress over lost kids and cause mothers to snap from to",
          "Really was expecting more being Alberta's Capital. One animal per pen mainly female. Small pens and farm animal petting zoo was lame. Only babies were meerkats. Will never recommend to anyone. If you want a zoo in Alberta go to Calgary. Maintaining parts of the park attractions",
          "great times with animals that is perfect for families and children alike. so many animals to see and learn about",
          "A great place for small children to look and explore animals in a storybook environment. For example the three little pigs exhibit and mother goose.",
          "I recently dropped by for a Pokemon event. It was great to get a chance to see the red pandas, llamas, capybara, tortoises, elephant, zebras, and so many more. This zoo offers a good balance of local and exotic, mammal and other. I was impressed that they thought of having some",
          "We visited the Edmonton zoo in August 2016. It was a nice sunny day, perfect for walking around the zoo. Although my daughter is a teenager, she found her first visit to zoo to be quite enjoyable with lots of photo opps. There is a farm animals petting zoo, reptiles, tigers,",
          "We went to the Safari night put on and it was awesome. They lured all the stops all night and had it all set up perfect. Was a great night for me and the kids.",
          "While the Edmonton Valley Zoo may not be as large as other zoos we have been to, our kids love the interactive nature of the zoo. Each time we have gone, employees have had different animals available to interact with and to learn about, and our kids have learned so much! They",
          "Great place to visit on a nice summer day. Lucy the elephant is such a special lady. Love the way she paints. There are also many interesting animals and birds to see. They also run children summer Zoo Camps that the children loved to attend. Great learning experience.",
          "Our trip to the zoo was fantastic. There was a young man walking around a different animal each time we seen him telling us about the animal and answering any questions. Even let my boys touch the animal. We visited the zoo at the perfect time in the evening when the animals",
          "We took the kids to the zoo, I found it was a little pricey for entrance, not a whole lot to see. We noticed the bald eagle was in a very small cage, he couldn't fly around, sat on a branch, staring at the wall of his cage, not good enough for a majestic bird. At the petting zoo",
          "Whilst the entrance is very grand and promising, overall the site is very dated and tired, with large areas apparently left completely fallow (this may be a factor of the time of the year). A limited range of obscure animals, with equal limited attempt to make displays inviting",
          "I enjoyed it, but it seemed as tho everything was hard to see, no bears? And I paid full price and only had a hour, was very rushed",
          "I have been there a few times over the years - this was the first time I saw Lucy (elephant) being taken for a walk. I was not expecting this as I did not know she got walked. It was good to see but still I wonder if she is sad for more room and other elephants... At any rate",
          "I had not been to the Edmonton Valley Zoo in ~15 years. I was impressed to see the improvements! The front entrance now has a small splash pad right beside a cafe that serves beer and wine! BONUS :) The otters are right up front too, and they were very interactive. The train",
          "Has been a while but whole family visited many memorable pic's. Animals & built sites are a treasure to see & remember.",
          "My boyfriend and I visited this zoo while we were in Edmonton and we had a good time but we expected more. I mean the animals are amazing but the zoo is so small. We expected this to be a half-a-day adventure but we were able to walk around and see every single animal in 90",
          "My wife and I are docents at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, so while visiting in the Edmonton area, we had to take in the Valley Zoo. It is a very well-run operation with some very unique features. The most unique is the glacier-to-river exhibit that invites the",
          "Nice place, lots to see. The kids enjoyed it! The paddle boats are ridiculously overpriced! While the train and the carousel are free. The entrance staff is quite rude. The staff at the rides were very friendly. It would be great to see a playground of sorts there.",
          "been along time since the children and I were here,it was so much fun,the animals are so well taken care of.we never even noticed the rain walking around.great family place lots to see and do!",
          "We only spend about an hour and a half here, wasn't much to do or look at but it looks like there are going to be renovations that could improve the decor. The theme-ing is very lack luster and the enclosures aren't very exciting to look at. a few of the animals were missing.",
          "The Edmonton Valley Zoo is small enough that it only takes a day to see it. Their selection of animals is very enjoyable, and they have some areas that are fun just to play on, such as the whale skeleton seats. Many of the exhibits are made to maximize the animals' movements",
          "This isn't the largest zoo I've ever seen, but wow, does it have some great animals and well-designed exhibits. They have some animals that you can only find in Canada (i.e.wolves, seals), as well as others that are not often in zoos but are fun to see (i.e. american bison,",
          "With the changes the zoo is making currently is getting better and better. It's a fun day with the kids to run around and see all the different animals they have. I just wish that some of the new areas were easier to see. The lemurs, for example, have a nice area off to the",
          "This place has come a along way over the years. There are numerous animals to see and you can even have a picinic after a nice stroll looking at the animals. One of the most favorite things to see if you are \"city folk\" is the petting zoo. And the best yet is to see the elephant",
          "After skipping the zoo for a few years, we were quite pleasantly suprised by the massive improvements to the experience. Paved paths where gravel walks used to be make the zoo much easier to navigate for the mobility impaired. Huge animal enclosures are much nicer than the San",
          "Been going to the Valley Zoo since I was little and I still love this Zoo as an Adult now taking the grand kids! It's a great day to enjoy the wonderful animals and it's a big event seeing LUCY the Elephant, she is a beauty!!!! Enjoy the asking, ice cream and seeing all those",
          "I took my 3 youngest kids (12,9,5) to check out the progress of the zoo's renovations. What a wonderful job they've done! This zoo has been, absolutely transformed. Now, you can make a day of it (3-4 hours). There's plenty of walking to be done. There are snacks/drinks to be",
          "We as a family love going to the zoo..we have passes so we can go anytime..each you do see something different, all the kids love the animals and Lucy.",
          "An interactive zoo where kids can pat a lot of the animals that are there. Lots to do and see, well worth a visit while in Edmonton",
          "We spent three hours at the zoo. It's not massive but a nice easy walkable size. The animals all looked healthy and the staff were very friendly. There are a couple of places to eat and the food was decent. For kids there is lots to do with the train, petting zoo, carousel and",
          "Its always a good day when you can visit Edmonton Zoo. I Love to see Lucy on her daily walks and also seeing the red pandas.",
          "The zoo overall is very nice, however, not the best I've seen. It is a very long walk from animal to animal sometimes. Some of the animals homes are sad and have signs asking people to donate for new homes. Obviously the zoo is lacking in money. Had a pretty good range of",
          "While visiting Edmonton with my daughters (5 and 3) we visited the Valley Zoo. This was on a Monday which was perfect. The location seemed very easy to get to however at the time there is a little construction and oh by the way a roundabout to maneuver through, other than that",
          "We go every year and really enjoy seeing all the improvements they have been doing over the last few years. It is all coming together and there is lots to see and do. My kids (7,5,1) love going. We also booked a birthday party here a few years ago and I highly recommend it. It",
          "The Edmonton zoo is a great family e penitence. I recently visited with my sister and her two girls ( 4 & 7). The train ride was exciting for them. The petting zoo was awesome. We got to see Lucy the elephant do a show. All this was free with admission. It us well laid out.",
          "This zoo is dying. There is not as much animals as there used to be. The place just looks like its going under. It's not really worth going too.",
          "We were in Edmonton over the winter and took some time to visit the zoo. Even though the weather was mild I didn't really expect to see much, I was pleasantly surprised! Almost all of the exhibits had animals out and about, we even got to see the elephant. If you live in",
          "The valley zoo is in a continuous state of improvement. The friends of the zoo are awesome Great place to take families. Young kids live it because it's not so overwhelming. Check out Lucy the elephants paintings in the gift shop and the beaver dam",
          "Not a world class zoo. Zoo is becoming run down and weathered. Time to send Lucy to an elephant sanctuary as this zoo lacks the space to properly care for her.",
          "There is plenty of free parking and our grandchildren loved the animals. We also hopped on the mini train that takes us past the farm animals and a tortoise or two. There were clear paths to walk with a huge play area for the kids. Popsicles were a welcome respite on a hot",
          "This is a smaller zoo but it's still nice and friendly. The staff are completely genuine and caring. I encountered random ducks that are friendly with the staff and guests and they made the experience great.",
          "Not far from the mall area, about a $15 taxi ride, spend a leisurely 3 hours walking through exhibits. Though not huge, enough animals to make trip worthwhile and staff is happy to tell you about the animals, how they're cared for, where they come from, etc. Worth the $11 entry.",
          "I was here with a senior and they loved seeing all of the animals. However there wasn't a lot of places for us to sit down and there were no alternate modes of transport to walking. Some of the enclosures were a bit small but for the most part it was a great outing.",
          "Every time we go to the Edmonton zoo it gets a little better. Sure, it's not a world class facility. But, for a local day trip for the family, you can't go wrong. A family of up to seven is about 45 bucks and if you catch an exhibit or two, it's an easy 3 hour visit. Also, I see",
          "I was a little hesitant on going there with all the negative remarks about zoo. I was pleasantly surprised, the animals are very well kept. And the area was very clean. The would highly recommend taking your families there.",
          "A fair variety of animals to see (still including Lucy, the world famous elephant), the price of admission is reasonable & it's always a great day out with the family.",
          "After reading other reviews I was worried this place was terrible...but as expected people seemed to just be \"picky\". People are comparing the zoo to Calgary and other world famous zoos. You can't do that. Edmonton does not have a zoo like Calgary, just like Calgary does not",
          "I took my family here on the 21st of May 2016 for site seeing , We where so expectant, because we have visited Calgary zoo and expecting more from Edmonton valley zoo. But unfortunately the zoo were empty, with handful of animals. However the zoo have a serene environment.",
          "Went with the kids. People had undersold this zoo - its small but quaint with some great Canadian animals. Arctic Wolves were great to see - the female one is more tame and gets walked around the zoo on a leash. The Elephant Lucy gets walked around the zoo as well (we missed",
          "We have been to several larger zoos in Melbourne and Calgary so perhaps we were expecting more from Alberta's capital city. Overall the zoo was very clean and the animals were well taken care of. It's just that there is not much there. The park surrounding the zoo, Laurier Park,",
          "I loved there. It's a small zoo but worth it. I passed 2 beautiful parks on the way. I literally fell in love with Edmonton every single day",
          "Spent Sunday April 17th at the zoo-my first visit. I was very disappointed (as were the other people in our party). Saw elephant Lucy, out having a walk, at a distance. Many exhibits were empty. I would recommend the Kamloops Wildlife Park as a much better venue for viewing",
          "I'm glad that I was able to check out the zoo in Edmonton. We finally made it. I love the otters enclosure I thought it was nicer than the one in Calgary. And the meerkats enclosure was spectacular, being so open. The admission was great for a family. It was neat seeing the",
          "If I had children my review could be different. I found this a very nice place with a decent amount of animals, but it was a very short visit. That's why I say it could be different with children as I am sure the day lasts longer with them. Overall it was a nice little walk",
          "We have been in the summer and it felt like a different zoo. Not all of the animals are available for viewing in the spring. The food vendors, all but one, are closed. I spent over half an hour in a line up to get ice cream cones for lunch. I think entrance should have been",
          "The zoo is missing quite a bit of animals. Very small zoo. Not many visitors either. Don't think the zoo will last much longer. But sure is nice to go for a couple of hours.",

          "As a San Diego native and a frequent visitor at the SD Zoo and Wild Animal Park (now called Zoo Safari Park), it was difficult for me to see most of the animals (at least those that were on display) in small, messy enclosures. Easter Monday at the Zoo was publicized and",

          "I have been to some world class zoos and some not so great zoos. This one falls in the middle. It has been neglected for many years and slowly they are improving exhibits ad doing more programming. There are some animals to see and because it is not a busy zoo, little guys and",
          "My wife and I went to the Valley Zoo to see the Otters because my wife just loves these animals in action. The facility is too small to house the Elephant called Lucy and the other animals have more space then Lucy. I think the valley Zoo should be moved to more suitable",

          "Zoo is small enough to do in an afternoon. My kids loved the day but to be honest I left feeling a little sad for Lucy the elephant. She looks sad. I get that if they moved her he might die bit what a lonely life. Female elephants do not live in solitude. Ugh. But still was a",
          "This is a small zoo focused on native animals with a very large and interactive farm exhibit. The zoo is well taken care of and has a very natural feeling. I enjoyed it.",
          "FREE LUCY!!! Too small, animals seem cramped and unhappy. Not all that well kept. Some of the newer exhibits show promise, perhaps a move to a zoo featuring local wildlife would be more appropriate.",
          "This zoo is absolutely horrific. There is nothing to see, nor is there anything to do, They have a very sad petting zoo and the only highlite is a very sad looking Lucy the elephant",
          "I've been enjoying our Valley Zoo since i was a young girl and now i bring my son and nephew here. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the location is great. Very good way to spend a day with the family or even a solo day to stroll or enjoy the park to read or just enjoy",
          "We don't visit the edmonton zoo often but when we did we noticed that they had made some upgrades and it was a lot nicer than the first time we visited. There was an issue with a lot of bee's throughout the park which wasn't great for the little ones.",
          "I took a group of friends here, all in their 20`s. It was a beautiful day and we had a great walk around. It would have been nive to be able to see more of the animals. We saw a lot of signs that said some were there but we couldn`t see any. They were doing an Elephant show but",
          "My boyfriend and I go here several times throughout the year. We usually end up eating a snack there, and are pretty satisfied with the prices. Usually at attractions such as these they can get rather expensive however they have some budget friendly items on their menu.",

          "This is a very sad zoo. Few animals in small cages or enclosures. One poor elephant who spends the winter in a concrete bunker. Expensive entry. On site food/beverages highly inflated prices. Make the trip to Calgary and see a zoo worth seeing. The Edmonton Zoo is an",
          "Wonderful place to spend a day. Great exhibits and plenty of animals. Beautiful river valley and trails close by.",

          "What started as a story land area with some animal to a new and special place. Many of the animal enclosures have allowed the animals to be in a more natural setting. More changes are planned.",

          "Our trip to the Valley Zoo surprised me. It has been a number of years since we've been there, and we found that it has changed a lot. The old \"storybook\" theme is pretty much muted now, but there's certainly plenty to explore for children of all ages. Some of the newer",
          "The Edmonton Valley Zoo is educational for all ages. There are many animals to come and see and lots for children to do. lots of walking , but there are wheelchairs assessable and strollers to rent . The zoo relies mostly on donations and your supports..",
          "My wife and I took our daughter (12) and we enjoyed it very much. Parts of the zoo were closed (of course), but we still got to see plenty of animals, and the light installations were amazing! Will go again next year.",
          "We really enjoyed visoting the zoo in Septmeber even though it was rainy and cold. I feel sorry for the animals but it is something to do. We went to the Festival of Lights in December and thoroughly enjoyed it.",

          "Kids will enjoy this small but pretty zoo. Annual passes mean you can take your kids at all times of year. There are over 350 kinds of animals that provide learning opportunities for all. The staff are great and always willing to inform visitors. The zoo is owned and",
          "This zoo was great! Make sure you go on a warm day though because pretty much all of it is outside. We enjoyed ourselves. Great way to spend a day with the family or out of town guests. Lucy the Elephant is awesome! : )",
          "We have gone to the zoo a couple time in the past 2 years and each time it is a great day. Great animals and the staff are always helpful and informative.",
          "This zoo is large enough you will want to spend the whole day there. There are scheduled talks about different animals during the day. I recommend being there at the scheduled times as they share lots of good information, and sometimes you get hands on experience. Also you are",
          "Unfortunately, my first time to the Edmonton zoo was during the latter part of October. A lot if the animals are away from their exhibit areas as the zoo prepares for winter. I hope to revisit next summer to better experience all the animals. I would say the map and directions",

          "Want to see an elephant being walked on pedestrian paths, unleashed with her best friends? How about a zebra or red panda baby? Do you long for a zoo that offers unlimited free carousel rides, rolling hills and a beaver dam gym for your children to climb on? It may not be flashy",
          "We spent a beautiful fall Saturday morning here with our 3 boys and really enjoyed the whole experience! It is smaller than Calgary but a lot of the animals are closer and it isn't nearly as crazy busy. The free \"train\" ride and carousel were a huge hit and the price wasn't a",

          "As far as a zoo goes, this one is pretty poor. One would think that the capital city of the province would have something a little more impressive but they have this. There is a limited amount of animals. And some animals information says they prefer being in large groups or",

          "I've never heard any of my friends talk about the zoo in Edmonton, only Calgary, so my expectations going here, weren't very high. I'm happy to stand corrected! The family had a blast here. Lots a wild life, friendly staff and was an excellent venue.",
          "Not as nice as Calgary but great for kids. Things are getting better but still lots of room for improvement.",
          "I had never been to the Edmonton Zoo but got introduced to it by a friend. I was pleasantly surprised by the surrounding area and amazed at all of the renovations they've done considering, what I'm told, it used to look like. It isn't Calgary zoo for certain but then I don't",
          "We have been to the zoo a few times with our kids. There has been a lot of updates and improvements but Some areas need some attention. It is a fun couple hours, clean, with plenty to see and do but nothing compared to some of the zoos we have been to across Canada and the U.S.",
          "It is just average nothing made me say wow. I've been here 2 times now and still haven't seen the elephant. The little monkeys are so cute and fun to watch. They need more bathrooms. Had to walk quite a ways to use one. Had lunch at the cafe and the cesar salad was great.",
          "I have not been to the zoo in many years, so my husband and I were very surprised with all the changes . We took our young nieces with us and spent several hours walking (running around) the zoo. The staff walk Lucy, our aging elephant , every day when the weather is good, and",

          "It was a great place to visit and my two year old loved it. Lots to see. The food prices were exorbitant however. $10.50 for a cheeseburger combo, $9.25 for a hot dog. I will visit again but will definitely bring my own food.",

          "Well kiddies may enjoy the \"Hobby Farm\" and the \"Choo Choo ride\" and all the creatures big and small but I can only say that the premises need work. The habitat for the imprisoned animals is certainly lacking or needs improvement. The grounds are well kept and the staff are",

          "We were looking forward to the train at the zoo. When we got on it the driver looked as bored as could be and showed no enthusiasm at all. Once we were on the train we understood why... it only goes a few meters and then turns around and goes back. Even a toddler could be bored",
          "Unfortunately when we went we didn't get to see a lot of the animals. They seemed to be in hiding. The meerkat babies were our favorite animal to see. The petting zoo/farm area was cool. We almost didn't find the elephant but right before we left he walked by and that was",
          "The new additions to the zoo are much needed improvements and focusing on local wildlife is a nice change. And the Festival of Lights in the winter is really cool with all the lights and the animals in winter (as long as it's not too cold).",
          "I went here today with my mom and my 3 year old daughter. We paid $36, half of this zoo the cages were absolutely empty, they have so much property but no animals. I don't mind paying $36 bucks but for this zoo it's absolutely not worth it, very very disappointing Edmonton Zoo.",
          "Attended an after hours business group & families function and was quiet impressed with how they have expanded and improved some of the areas. The animals looked healthy and the staff obviously cared for them. It is not a huge zoo so you don't have to tie up an entire day to go",

          "We had a fun day trip but other zoos in Alberta were more exciting. I found the animals were very hard to see and not much to see. Great for a simple day out with family.",
          "Some things don't change but the Zoo is growing up. I like the direction it's going in..beautiful front courtyard with one of my favourite bakery cafes in residence (Good Earth... Soon yummy everything). Visit this great foyer just for a little nosh you walk the trails, visit",
          "We went on a beautiful day. The zoo itself is very nice. Clean, spacious and has several areas for kids to play. The animals that I saw looked well cared for, which is very important. The zoo is not much better than Saskatoon's zoo/forestry farm. The Calgary zoo is MUCH better -",
          "All the renos they did were very disappointing. Nothing exciting or really new. The exciting part for my 5 year old was seeing elephant Lucy walking around. We walked pasted her 2 times and the staff totally ignored her. What and exciting great experience but not even a",
          "They have a fairly nice selection of exotic animals as well as Canadian wildlife. The park is clean and well maintained. We didn't see any of the scheduled shows but they do have them. Some of the animals were sleeping so we missed them but also left before the busy crowds come",
          "We took our son to the zoo this weekend. There really weren't as many animals as I expected. None of the stands or rides were operating. And the elephant was barley visible in her area. Next time I'll drive the extra 2.5 hours to go to Calgary. Maybe we went too early in the",
          "it's a shame to see zoos like this, when you know that they could do so much better. small exhibits and staff that dont seem to care sums up my visit here. you leave here thinking \"i know with a little help this place could be something\"",
          "Wherever I go, I always take a day to spend in its local zoo. And I always thought zoos in developed countries are better than the ones in my country, until I visited Valley Zoo. Cleanliness wise, it is better. But collections wise, there aren't much to see. I don't think it",
          "I have never been to a zoo before, despite being an animal lover. I was disappointed when I arrived. The enclosures were too small for the animals. The Wallabies looked so depressed. The elephant enclosure looked like it was built in the Victorian Era. The cages for the owls and",
          "My wife and I recently went to the zoo on Valentines Day to check it out. We haven't been there since we were little. One thing I hear about the zoo is \"it sucks because its nothing compared to the Calgary zoo\". If you go to the Valley zoo trying to compare it to the Calgary",
          "We didn't realize the majority of walking was outside. But that's our fault. Had a lot of fun with our 2 year old. Got there right at opening so it was very quiet.",
          "I have no kids that are small anymore but I just love this little storybook zoo. From its little train to the storybook settings through out what a great date night. Of course its for the kids...so please go check it out...too much fun!",
          "Really enjoyed our trip in early October! It was cooler and there weren't much crowds which made it more relaxing to walk around. We lucked out and got to see the Tiger being fed as well as a seal show and Lucy the elephant was walking down the trail alongside us. Overall I",
          "What a disappointment ,I expected more from Edmonton , the enclosures for the birds and monkeys are way to small and so boring for the animals ,many of the animals display institutionalized pacing back and forth which is so sad to see and so unnecessary in the year of 2014",
          "I hadn't been to the Valley Zoo in a couple of years and was \"very\" impressed with the improvements. Until the upgrade had been done, sadly our little zoo wasn't much to get excited about. We were very pleased with the renovations, it is now a little zoo that we Edmontonian's",
          "We went to the zoo yesterday on Free Admission Day and other than the traffic to get in, it was a good day. The zoo is laid out in a nice fashion that meanders around to all the different enclosures and buildings. Most of the animals were out and about, it was a cool morning",
          "My first time ever in a zoo as a 22 year old woman. Took my mother here while she was visiting and we all had a great time (minus the 30+ degree heat). I would advise going during the fall as there is not much shade when you get further in. We caught a glimpse of Lucy who was",
          "I recently went to the newly renovated valley zoo. It was a very pleasant afternoon! There are many animals to see, but the favourite is Lucy, who often walks around the zoo with her keepers. The staff were pleasant and informative, even on a busy day! The new entrance is",
          "I have lived in edmontonmost of my live. My parents took me to the zoo and I in turn took my children to the zoo, and soon i will take my grandchildren Yes things have changed, the train is now on wheels, no more butcher,baker and the candle stick maker. Chldren can still touch",
          "Nothing really spectacular at this Zoo. Grand daughter wanted to see the Meerkats, a new arrival at the zoo. Other than that I found things somewhat disjointed. Absolutely recommend Calgary Zoo over the Edmonton Zoo.",
          "Small zoo looks like it has recently has a lot of work done. We went in morning on a holiday weekend and it was not too busy but by afternon there were long queues to get in. Putting aside the argument on keeping animals in Zoos on the whole the place seemed clean and animals",
          "I spent half the day at this beautiful and amazing zoo with my wife, it is quite far from downtown and the bus that gets you to the parking lot only have routes until 11:00, so we took the route 4 at 9:00 and walked through a park and a natural reserve, we really enjoyed the",
          "It was our first time at this zoo and we enjoyed it alot! My 4 year old LOVED seeing Lucy ( the elephant) walk around the zoo grounds. And the petting area with the sheep and goat was a HUGE hit with her!!! We really enjoyed all the exhibits and all the information posted about",
          "I spent sevral hours at the zoo with my daughter and friends.Parts of the zoo are in need of updating, but many exhibits were really well done. Not as big as the Calgary Zoo, but good for about two hours with a family - we found lots of things to interest us. Watching the",
          "I used to come to this zoo all the time when i was young. I took my 2 year old this summer. The zoo has been completely renovated and looks fantastic. They've updated exhibits to allow for better viewing. The petting zoo area of course was a hit with my son. We went in the",
          "The zoo is going through some amazing renovations and once complete will be an even better place to visit. The place right now is still a great place to visit. They have many interactive components and enough to keep people of all ages interested. I would recommend checking out",
          "After moving to Edmonton, I've always wanted to go to the zoo. I had been hearing very negative things about it from clients, but I decided to take a chance and go anyway. I'm really glad I did. They have recently renovated the entrance buildings (so I am told) and it's a great",
          "Its a bit of a small zoo, but there are still a lot of attractions. My family and I go a lot, but sometimes we are disappointed with not exactly knowing directions, underwhelming rides for younger guests, and animals sometimes hidden and not in our sight. Oh well, I guess we",
          "This was our first visit to the Valley Zoo. We spent a day there last week and really enjoyed it. The entrance plaza has a coffee shop, washroom, gift shop (of course) and access to the new education building, in addition to the admission gate. Lots of visitors stopped to get",
          "The zoo is actually really small but you can still see rare and nice animals such as red panda from Nepal, elephants and many more. They have a nice little farm where you can pet absolutly every animals in it such as baby cows, lambs, chickens, goats and even the farm cat. Dont",
          "Much improved from a couple years ago. Many renovations and better exhibits. Had a great day with our young children. Train ride and merry-go-round ride were included in admission. Short little rides but they were perfect for us. Loved seeing many animals up close and",
          "The reviews vary wildly for this zoo so let me start off by saying this review is from the perspective of a parent with young (pre-school) kids. This isn't a commentary on whether the zoo is ethical or not. As a parent with young kids a visit to the Valley Zoo is a wonderful way",
          "I visited the Edmonton Valley Zoo with my family for the first time this past weekend. Judging by the entrance, architecture, landscaping, signage... I thought it was going to be a world-class zoo experience. Unfortunately, the living condition of some (most) of the animals is,",
          "I haven't been to the valley zoo in over a decade. It was a great way to spend a hot afternoon outside learning and seeing animals. My favourite are the tigers, seals, and Lucy! Two handlers were walking her around the zoo for a while. We saw her out and about in a few spots.",
          "The zoo is a storied (sorry for the pun) place. They have shifted their focus to highlighting more of the northern animals. They still have Lucy the elephant. Say what you will about the ethics of keeping so intelligent a creature in a zoo, but kids love her and she acts as a",
          "This is a great place to visit with small kids. If it's going to be a hot day I suggest going backwards from what you think is forward. Do the big animals first, they are in the newer area. There are less trees/shade and no bathrooms (being built still on our visit). If you",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit! Having read the reviews, I wonder what people wanted or expected for a city zoo. We had a peaceful morning walking around the exhibits. We found it clean and yes some of the exhibits were under construction but it didn't detract from our",
          "Having read some other reviews of this place I sincerely wonder if they went to the same place. They criticize it for having small enclosures which left me curious as to what their idea of a large enough closure is. The majority of enclosures were spacious and definitely gave",
          "Not sure why they have an elephant in a cold climate, they should have more knowledge then that! A dumpy, sad place for people, I can't imagine how sad it must be for the poor animals! Not much has changed since it opened decades ago, the exhibits are still very small and",
          "Personally reading all the reviews this place gets I really don't agree with the horrible rating this zoo has gotten. This zoo is amazing! They have been making huge strides in the past couple years to make their zoo more attractive and appealing. To make their exhibits bigger",
          "I've always been one to try and see both sides of the coin...of the value of zoos for the betterment of the species as a whole and the education of our youth towards appreciating earths creatures so dont think I write this lightly, im a 31 year old man brought to tears by what I",
          "Arrived - renewed my yearly multi - facility pass. Horrible service, paid the $, and also asked to pay for my husband (my boys also have passes). Train wasn't working, HUGE broken limb off tree blocking a path (not blocked off) menu has increased in priced & less offered. Kids",
          "We were a bit surprised to see so much construction. A good chunk of the enclosures had construction workers and machinery in them. On top of that, a lot of the animals hadn't been let into their enclosures for the day so I wouldn't advise going first thing in the morning.",
          "We recently took our 3 year old just to pass some time while we were visiting Edmonton. I had been to the Valley Zoo about five years ago abd was not impressed so expectations were nit high. I am happy to say that I was happily surprised. They have done, and continue to do, a",
          "We visited the zoo for the 2014 Easter event and were pleased to see that the zoo is undergoing extensive renovations! There is, now, a restaurant; although we didn't visit it. The entry to the zoo was somewhat congested. Great to see the new kiosk, but having people trying to",
          "This zoo has many features that make it a very good resource for children to learn about animals, both wild and domestic, North American and global. We took our pre-school grandson who really enjoyed petting the animals in the Urban Farm as well as rides on the train and merry",
          "This place is pathetic. One of the worst zoos I've ever seen. The exhibits are horrible. I feel sorry for the animals. The place has barely changed in 30 years. Compared to Calgary or almost any other city zoo, it's an embarassment to the people and the city of Edmonton.",
          "By far the saddest zoo, I've ever seen. If you go you will know what I mean. I went with my family for the first time last summer and it was closing in an hour so we were let in for free and that was the true value of our visit. If I had paid I would've asked for my money back.",
          "We had a good time at the zoo. It is a big upgrade from the last time we visited a few years ago. Lots of different animals to see, and they seem to have larger pens than most zoos we have been to.",
          "I went to the Valley zoo sometime in the early months of 2013, and I truly enjoyed the visit. Unfortunately because it was still winter, a lot of the animals were not outside to be seen, but I still had a wonderful time because I got to see Lucy the Elephant twice as she was",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I came here for the day and loved it! It was very hot but it was a fun thing to do! Made for a different kind of date and something exciting to do. The zoo had major construction going on but it didn't really effect our time there. Would definitely recommend it.",
          "We went in February, we didn't think there would be anything to see, but there was so much! You have to see Lucy, a big beautiful elephant, the pride and joy of the zoo. It was 20$ for two of us, very affordable and so much fun!",
          "We went in March so it was a little cold. I went with my 3 year old, my friend and her two kids. They had a blast. The loved looking and playing around the sculptures. A lot of animals to look at too.",
          "The protesters were a disappointment. It Wall to wall people inside. It was a little on the dull side, I think it will be much better once the renovations are done.",
          "its not real big but what we saw we enjoyed. It was very relaxing.The Elephant was not around but i appreciate that they walk her all the time. one thing i really appreciated is it was not all commercialized like the. it was clean. didn't really see much of the animal care",
          "After visiting the zoo not too long ago, I found the whole experience fairly good especially considering the cost. The summer rates are $13.25 for an adult and $8.00 for a child. If one were to consider the cost of going to other attractions such a movie the price is very",
          "We took our 2 granddaughters for a visit recently and spent the afternoon at the zoo. We hadn't been there for many years so it was a great opportunity to re-visit an Edmonton attraction. We loved the train ride and the paddle boats. Enjoyed all the animals but would have",
          "This place is in sad shape. Has the same \"attractions\" as it did 25 years ago when I was a kid- nothing has been updated or repaired in forever. The animals seem to hide all day- it looks as if they hate life and I would too if I lived here honestly. I love Edmonton, but the",
          "it's a very nice zoo.u can pet some animals.there's a train that will tour u around the zoo.then there's a lot of kinds of animals!they had tiger & zebra!!me & my nephew had lots of fun!",
          "Lots of work being done in the zoo when we visited. Nice to see different variety of animals. It is a little bit of a drive to find. But I would go back again",
          "Run down, filthy..most attractions you couldn't see...habits for the animals were appaling..looks like they are updating...should close it and refurbish old habits and clean it up a lot...waste of money and time...thoroughly disappointed...",
          "we really wanted to see elephants and when we got there she was no where to be seen. After a long hot walk to a meadow where she was taken for a walk she was in a place then not open to the public ...I don't understand why the elephant cant be walked after the zoo closes to the",
          "The Edmonton Valley Zoo has been upgrading their facility with great results. The annual flowers that have been planted are very attractive. The Arctic Shores exhibit is first class and the construction to the new entry and Wander area is looking great. The Edmonton Zoo is",
          "My wife myself and my sister in law spent a day at the zoo whilst not as big as the Perth zoo it was a very enjoyable day and worth a look. The only issue I had was that the map for where the Emu's came from in Australia was in correct. But that aside a fun day.",
          "I live in Edmonton and am embarrassed that the zoo has fallen in such disrepair, the animals do not seem to be provided with even the basic necessities. Their water bowls were empty and their enclosures were pathetic. We visited last summer(2012) and hope that the conditions",
          "Calgary Zoo was our first option but with the flooding and partial closure still in place we opted for Edmonton. I have never been to Calgary Zoo so im unable to compare but Edmonton was great! It was cheap and had a variety of animals to see. most of which were out for us to",
          "Had read some recent reviews and wasn't planning on attending, but we had some extra time in Edmonton and decided that our 3 1/2 year old would probably love this as a first zoo trip, and we were right! Although there is some construction most of the exhibits weren't affected.",
          "The zoo has a combination of rare and common animals. Surprisingly No Moose,Polar Bear,lions,giraffes, hippos, rhinos, and at the same time it has RedPanda,wolfs,a good collection of owls,Lemurs and reindeer.",
          "Disappointing range of animals and basic facilities, Elephant House was empty - apparently the elephant had been taken for a walk but we didn't see it; hard to miss something the size of an elephant in such a small place but we did! Perhaps the extensive renovations will",
          "The zoo is very small and a lot of the exhibitions are closed for renovations. We did not go on the train as the wait was too long and it did not seem worth the wait! Compared to other zoos I have been to this one is really below average but at least our 18 month old was amused",
          "This is a very small zoo. If you've ever been to the Calgary Zoo, you will be bitterly disappointed in this one. If you have children under the age of 5, then this would be a pleasant outing. Expect to be there 1 to 2 hours IF the animals are out. You won't be spending any",
          "I read the reviews before I planned a trip to this zoo. It was exactly what most say. A very little zoo perfect for a couple hours of entertainment. My 3 year old daughter loved it. It was a zoo that she was able to walk through so she wasn't stuck in her stroller. Everything is",
          "My children and I went to the zoo for Canada Day and were THRILLED to find that we no longer needed to purchase tickets for the train ride and the merry-go-round!!!!! These are now included in the admission fees - yippee!!! There have been multiple great improvements to the zoo",
          "I have reviewed this attraction before but this was before they started all the renovations and all the chaos that is going on at the zoo. We went there in May on the long weekend with our son who was really too little to appreciate the sights and sounds, but we thought we might",
          "Granted, the Edmonton Valley Zoo is not as grand and elaborate as Calgary's. None the less it still makes a great day trip in the summer! My boyfriend and I go every year and each time it makes for an enjoyable day. The new sea lion exhibit they have it just wonderful! It is",
          "I try to go at least twice a year to the zoo - fun animals to see. The rides & petting zoo don't open until May long weekend (I think). Happy we went - go early to avoid the crowds.",
          "On a weekend trip to Edmonton and a couple of hours to kill, we went to the Zoo. There were not many exhibits open..we did see Lucy the elephant out taking a walk with her attendants ..that was really awesome! We only saw the lemurs, 2 alpacas, 2 white wolves, and the",
          "I have to commend the staff of the Valley Zoo. Every time we go, they are exceptional. They are always eager to help and always willing to educate. The zoo itself, however, could use a bit of a pick-me-up. I think some newer exhibits would be nice, even though what they",
          "it has been a long time since visiting, it is both great and sad place to visit. people feel that it is wrong to cage any animal, but without zoo's protecting and breeding programs these animals will be extinct.",
          "Nothing more to say... unless I need to come with 100 characters. Always liked the smaller well run zoos as opposed to the bigger ones where you (or the animals) are just a number.",
          "The new exhibits that are under construction and/or partially completed are fantastic. Wonderfully educational, climate appropriate. The animals are well cared for, staff is great, had a wonderful visit. And the care the elephant gets is second to none! Good job, all :).",
          "Considering the cold location, there is a good variety of wild life here. The animals have big warm shelters so I don't understand all the activist posts. If you need a family activity, it's a good choice.",
          "We took our 2 year old Great grandson and saw the animals again through his eyes. Great day. We hadn't been in a long time and it brought back memories of the trips with our own children.",
          "The zoo isn't the biggest or most elaborate in canada, but it is very educational and they give many good ideas for people about how you can help to conserve and protect the creatures of this planet. They also have a few new areas and animals. Very fun for the kids and adults!",
          "They really try and are updating the facility, but this is not a world class zoo. A bit like a prison for animals, with bad visiting facilities for humans. Let Lucy retire in California, it is too cold in Edmonton and very lonely for an animal that needs interaction with other",
          "I have say this is one of our favorite places to go all year round! Yes it's not the most spectacular zoo in the world, but it's ours. We love going on nice winter days it's a good walk and gives us something to look at! As for all the negatives about the animals out in the",
          "I am absolutely SICKENED with this zoo. I have no idea how this place is even running. I went for a visit to Edmonton for a few days and heard there was a zoo. Being a huge animal lover I had to go! I figured it would HAVE to be an indoor zoo though because of how cold it gets",
          "When I traveled to this zoo during the time I lived in the city of Edmonton, there were obviously not enough animals or services. I am also concerned over the animal's social network with humans. The famous Lucy elephant should not be living at the zoo, and should be with its",
          "Saw Lucy standing alone in a large pen. I thought these were social animals. I also didn't know they were comfortable in this climate. Hopefully, Lucy will have a warm home very soon.",
          "A third class, poorly funded place getting a much needed rebuild. Partially constructed with a good concept - northern zoo foa a northern city! Looks good. Not to be compared with a well funded zoo like Calgary but the construction and plans look like a winner for this small",
          "Sad to see so much potential being wasted. It is a nice area and what is there is verywell done and interesting. Nice for 1/2 a day unless you have kids in programs. They are trying to update with the seals etc, but it seems like small steps in a city rolling in money.",
          "This zoo is horrible , as a lover of animals i was sickened at the conditions these animals live in. By far the WORST zoo i have visited. I have even went so far as to write letters to animal welfare groups. Very disappointed in my city.",
          "A great place to take children for the day. Besides the animals there is a play area for kid that keep them busy for a long time.",
          "I`ve been to lots of zoos, even Edmonton years ago and then recently after all those years. I even donated a bird to there once many years ago. It`s one big depressing wake-up call, the Edmonton Zoo. Yes, Lucy was out walking about, feel sorry for her ( age-wise and with",
          "This zoo is very outdated and would be nicer if it was upgraded to something like the Calgary zoo. Way too small. Way too outdated.",
          "While it's a smaller zoo, the animals there are easily seen and have adequate space to live in. Our favorite animal was Lucy the elephant. We saw her at the end of her daily walk and got to watch her eat a large chunk of ice with grass in it. We also liked the fact that",
          "The Edmonton zoo is cute and sad all at the same time and world famous because all these celebs including Bob Barker (spay and neuter you pets) wants to save Lucy the Elephant! That's about the only reason to go and even then, you'll probably see her pound her head agains the",
          "Kids like it adults enjoy it and there is plenty of exibits for rain or shine. Ride the train it is fun! Bring a lunch there is not that many Healthy things to eat there, go in the early morning animals are out more then have a picnic at the park. Birds of prey demonstrations",
          "I have not been to Storyland Valley zoo since my children were little. Now as grandma I was lookin forward to taking my grandchildren back to the zoo the way I remembered it. I was very disappointed in the experience. The zoo is poorly kept, dirty, the animanls in less than",
          "It's being renovated so it'll get bigger....personally I think it's a little small, but the new ice area and sea lion should be fun to watch when it's done",
          "This zoo had been due for an upgrade for several years now. Construction is starting to wind down on the improvements and the new exhibits look to be winners. Can't wait to go back next summer.",
          "This poor zoo needs more funding Edmonton! Obviously it will never be on the same level as the Calgary zoo but I'm sure it can be a lot better than it is. This place has barely changed in the last 30 years. Realistic animal enclosures would be beneficial to not only the animal",
          "We enjoyed the parts of the zoo that we could get to, but there is a great deal of construction going on right now. However, the gibbons whooped and the tigers stalked us so that was fun. The new Arctic area was interesting but the seals were all inside rather than out in the",
          "This is a small zoo, not far from the West Edmonton Mall. It only takes a few hours to look around and stop for ice cream in the zoo. It makes a nice morning outing. The elephant gets to walk around out of it's cage sometimes, which is fun to see. One caveat, my friend",
          "Things are starting to look better, the new exhibit is very good, however still too many spaces empty. Not enough space to sit for the elephant show. Enjoyed the enterpreters wandering with animals or artifacts.",
          "The EVZ is run down and while they have been renovating, it still falls short and I find it to be lacking proper enrichments for a lot of the animals, such as the solitary elephant Lucy, the sea lion exhibit is disgusting and cruel. I will never go back, it is not a nice zoo.",
          "Having been to the zoo as a child back 35-40 years ago, I am glad to see that the zoo is modernizing and expanding. It was a good experience and look forward to the completion of the renovations and expansions.",
          "When we arrived we saw the current construction. As we entered we thought it was going to be a quick tour because at the beginning there wasn't many exhibits but as we kept going there were animals at every turn. the zoo was very clean and well managed. The animals appeared",
          "Had heard about the Edmonton Valley Zoo for a long time. Got to check it out before school started again very beautiful area with native and exotic species. But what i really liked was Lucy the Elephant i got to see her out on her walk that day. They also even have some Rare",
          "Very basic zoo; not a lot of selection of animals; the zoo needs updating and more things to make it more attractive to people to visit.",
          "The zoo has been building and adding for a few years now, it's been that long since I had been. We went with our kids a couple weeks ago and were surprised by how nice it is now. It's a relativly small zoo and it can be done in a half a day. Good programs and definatly moving",
          "Our trip to the zoo was more than I could have expected. The staff is amazing and so wonderful with the kids. Everyone we ran into was willing to answer question or help you out. We had the pleasure of walking along the path while they were walking Lucy the Elephant and it was",
          "It has good parking and nice upgrades .The animals are always visable and I especially love lucy the elephant the staff at the zoo are so good with her she seems to love them ,they are so gental and kind to her.We love the train ride and the minuture cattle are really cute",

          "It is great to see the new development going on at the Valley Zoo. Although my adult kids and I miss the old train that chugged through the animal exhibits. The grandkid's favorites are the Saito Centre and the new Polar Extremes. A good bargain for a day of fun. Would recommend",
          "We went to the Valley Zoo in July with company from Ontario. All of us loved the place. It's small enough to be able to see everything in a few hours yet large enough that I felt the animals had enough space. We really enjoyed the prairie dogs. The new arctic section is",
          "Friendly helpful staff. Great things to do and see. We took a lunch and ate there. While we were eating they were taking the elephant for a walk right past us. The kids were thrilled. The trainer stopped and let all the kids come up to touch. We are planning to go back",

          "After many years of traveling to Edmonton, it wasn't until today that we visited the zoo with our 4 and 11 yr olds. It is surprisingly small for a zoo - doesn't take much to see it all. It is also aging and not in the best of ways. There was much construction going on so i",

          "Been to many Zoo's,  this one is the worst for sure.  Minimal animals, no imagination used in putting the zoo together or having any sort of theme.  Main publicity comes from an old elephant and Bob Barker.  Almost impossible to find, an utter waste of time from September to May.",
          "If you have ever been to the Calgary Zoo I am sorry to say that Edmonton's Zoo is going to be a disapointment.The animals that they have are wonderful but their habitats are outdated and in need of a facelift. If you have younger children they would find the zoo great. However,",
          "I was so surprised with this zoo. I had only heard \"it's nothing like the Calgary Zoo.\" and that is true. It is more like a park, spread out and green! There is a train ride that little kids will love. Petting zoo is great. We watched a demonstration with wolves - the wolves",

          "The Zoo is outdated, seems like it needs more funds to get the right \"lift\". The large land there is not used efficietntly, should build new buildings for the sea life and a new area for the birds should be considered. Shame on the bird section, such a small cages.... comparing",

          "I agree that a zoo doesn't need to be big to be impressive but this zoo is both small and sad. We visited after Labour Day and found that some sections were inaccessible due to constuction and some activities were shut down for the season. It would have been nice to have been",

          "We had a good afternoon at the zoo. The kids love it here. The beaver dam climbing gym and merry-go-round were a huge hit. The kids love seeing all the animals.\nWe went on a Thursday afternoon. Sadly the train was not running on this day as \u2026",
          "I love the zoo I just wish they had like a tiger petting zoo in there something like that or somewhere you can give tigers like homeless cats or something I don't know",
          "Really enjoyed the zoo today.  Easy to see animals and was fun meeting the reindeer and Lucy the elephant.  Very friendly staff and beautiful park.  Enjoyed an ice cream at the ice cream  shop.  The weather was also fantastic.",
          "Always a good experience with my family. The family lead for the summer is very inexpensive and a great day trip with two little kids. The staff is always very friendly, courteous and helpful. I have been here many times and will go back many more!",
          "Had lots of fun here with my family when we took my 4 1/2 yr old Nephew. They are making some renovations so we are looking forward to seeing it when they are done. There were lots of staff around and demo's.\nThe highlight was seeing Lucy the elephant take her afternoon walk through the park...really close.",
          "The zoo is a joke. The animals\u2019 enclosures (especially the big cats\u2019) are beyond deplorable. Lots of wasted space and lots of empty enclosures. Kids enjoy the rather simple things ( sheep, goats, chickens, toy train and water feature \u2026",
          "It is a nice zoo, with some endemic animals, like elk and bison.",
          "It\u2019s an okay zoo, not a lot of animals but hard to expect anything too different with our weather. Our daughter had a blast.",
          "The work they have been doing is really improving the experience. It's a really good start. \nAlso kids birthday parties are a great way for little ones to have fun.",
          "I loved the elephant, the red pandas, and the capybara! They take such good care of their animals!",
          "It was my first visit to the zoo and me and my wife enjoyed our time. Good experience",
          "I like the place so much, although most of the animals were locked and their areas are closed, but over all was good",
          "Had a great time. The new urban farm and red panda area is amazing. Top notch staff that were able to answer any question I had. Would definitely recommend spending an afternoon here. So much to do and see.",
          "Everyone enjoyed the 4 hour visit to the Zoo today. There were eight of us from ages 18-55. I haven\u2019t been for a while and there are some lovely new facilities. We attended three presentations put on my Zoo staff and they were really \u2026",
          "The animals were basically non existent. Taking into consideration that heat of the day was a huge factor. The zoo is smaller on size so easy to cover everything in an afternoon and with a see Edmonton pass for the family it is inexpensive. \u2026",
          "First time at Edmonton Valley Zoo. It's a nice facility. Quite a bit of construction going on and a few empty exhibits, but that's expected at almost all the zoos I've ever been to. The staff was friendly. More than enough shady areas and places to sit and take a rest. Gravel parking lot, but plenty of space.",
          "It is a great place to spend weekend with family...... Not expensive and even vehicle is available for old people for $12.\nPlace to relax and eating hub is there, ample of space for kids to play and have fun. Also have joy rides for kids. \u2026",
          "Lots of new and updated habitats.  Still in the updating phase.  Lots of open ground to cover to get to exhibits.  All in all a good time to spend with the family.",
          "Good for kids. Not too much walking. Can do it in half a day. New red panda exhibit is great. Seal area was really nice too",
          "Wow! I didn't know that the entire facility was renovated. The food and amenities are quite impressive. A few minutes after we arrived I completely forgot we were still in Edmonton. If you haven't been to the zoo in a while, definetley recommend a visit.",
          "I love this place! So many animals and the staff always smiles at you",
          "My kids loved it here! So much to see and do! The carousel was a hit as was the train ride, we got to see Lucy the Elephant out for a walk and the zebras were happy to entertain!\n   The petting zoo was a big hit too!",
          "Love the zoo here even though its not the biggest they put a lot of time and effort into making it a great experience for all ages.",
          "Had a good time walking around for zoominescence with my family. Little difficult to read information on the animals outside but the Christmas light displays were very nice.",
          "Great place for a walk in very nice settings. That is,  if you don't mind not seeing most animals because they sleep or hide.  We like to take the grand kids there",
          "I chose to go here on my dream vacation assignment in my 8th grade english class but when I went I didn't even see any animals partly because it was 10 pm when I went but mostly because I am blind.",
          "Zoos themselves aren't great but the variety of animals are great here. The elephant is always something you should see. Most animals are nocturnal so don't be surprised if you don't see many. Clean and happy looking animals",
          "For $50 per family of seven Edmonton Valley Zoo is good outing. There are not many animals in the Zoo, but it is still worth. Zoo is located in a green sounding in the River valley. In $50 one can get free parking, free Rides for the kids and adults. Even the fast food is also cheaper than outside.",
          "Go with your family and you will enjoy the Zoo. Location is a plus as it has other parks around it. Lucy the elephant was one of the main attraction at the zoo. Staff is courteous and feiendly. Gift shop has some interesting accessories for kids and adults alike.",
          "It was a very fun and exciting experience.  a fabulous place for both adults and children.  Thank you very much to everyone who contributed.",
          "Was a bit chilly this time of year, but the light displays were definitely worth it!",
          "Very fun time,  Was very reasonably priced as well with an AMA Discount it cost us 2 adults $20 and the young one was free since she was under 2",
          "Love the zoo. Had a great time. Nice to see Lucy walking around and being cared for so well. Really enjoyable place to bring the kids to for the day",
          "The zoo was decent. Prices while there for food and drink were quite expensive.  The elephant is the main attraction and she is treated with kindness and gentle touches.",
          "Loved our visit!! Haven't been to the zoo in a couple of years. $50 for the family, fairly reasonable price. Everyone enjoyed the gibbon, meeting the Children's Python, following Lucy on her walk, a cramming into the train and carousel.",
          "Best family price in Alberta! The two indoor buildings are the best! So many great things to see. Fun for the whole family. Free parking!",
          "3/4 of the staff I spoke to were very unfriendly and not cheerful, the enclosures for some of the animals are too small (especially the bird cages)\nThe elephant was not around, when I asked why not they said she was out for a walk or out of \u2026",
          "We had my 5-year-old's birthday here. It was economical (cost less emotionally and temporally than renting a space, either a community centre or a City of Edmonton picnic area ). The staff was patient, calm, knowledgable and friendly. The \u2026",
          "I haven't been for a few years and was delighted to see all the new changes. It was a good hike around. Note, if you are pushing a wheelchair it is a little tough going up and down the hilly path.",
          "It's a great zoo I wish there were explanations (signage) as to why some animals hibernate, or are not on display.",
          "Great place, even if the parking lot is busy it doesnt feel too bad once I side due to lots of space and outside exhibits. Advance tickets are great to skip the line on busy days. There are lots of information sessions for different animals \u2026",
          "Shame on this zoo for keeping Lucy...Everything should boycott this zoo until the management does the right thing and allow lucy to be with her own kind! Shame on you Edmonton zoo for being so cruel!",
          "Big place and well kept but under construction and went during winter so a lot of animals were sheltered or  unavailable",
          "Heyyo, the Red Pandas are increasingly beautiful and same with the other animals and there's also a nice farm animal petting area as well as a train ride for the kids. My son really enjoyed our family trip there and there was also lots of parking space so no issues trying to park.",
          "the zoo is nice but it would be nice if we got something new because its stayed generaly the same for the pat 7= years and ive been going every year. great zoo :)",
          "Most animals are no where to be seen. There aren't any benches along walking path to just have a quick rest. Paid so much and didn't even have view area for the ref panda..every year is disappointing.",
          "Very nice, make sure you give yourself lots of time to see everything",
          "I am always so impressed how amazing the Edmonton zoo is.  The Red Panda section is so well done now, great petting zoo, goats grazing grass on the roof, owls, tiger, reindeer and so much more.  A must see for Lucy and anytime your in Edmonton.",
          "Nice for small kids but not enough animals",
          "Impressive range of animals.   Sad that so many are on the endangered list, but great that this zoo is doing so much for conversation.  The elephant was out to lunch,   while the artic wolf and tiger were having a good sleep.",
          "Fantastic place to take the family.  We have been coming here since the kids were little.  It is still a family favourite.   The new exhibits are great.  We even saw the otters!",
          "Renovations have been made, and the space provided to the animals have improved a lot in the new areas",
          "Full disclosure, I was considering booking the Otter room for an event but haven't actually booked anything yet, so not too sure on service. But, the facility itself is gorgeous, the city has done amazing work in putting together a visually \u2026",
          "It used to be a great place and still is. Recently renovated, clean and family friendly fun but I was once again dissapointed by the dwindling and declining number of displays. One should be ablento see way more for the price of admission comparing to what places such as Calgary and Vancouver offer.",
          "Probably my favorite happy place in Edmonton! I have always loved the zoo, and I'm so happy to see progress, new buildings, the animals are very well cared for, loved and in great shape. I even adopted the tiger(s) this week, and will most \u2026",
          "Great place for kids to run around and explore! Saw Lucy the elephants show and it was awesome. My son loved watching her kick the soccer ball, very informative as well. Also reasonably priced, especially if you have an AMA membership.",
          "The recent improvements and renovations should serve the city well for years to come. I was extremely impressed by both the staff and the facilities. Great place for all ages and a great way to spend a day.",
          "As long as Lucy the elephant remains in her terrible situation this zoo should not be supported. Lucy needs to be moved to an elephant sanctuary in a warm climate so she can live out her years with other elephants.",
          "They do some amazing conversation work. And every single employee I've ever met has been beyond dedicated to their job. Plus, I've had a few great dates here, so maybe I'm biased.",
          "Underwhelmed. A lot of enclosures were empty. No sign of the elephant for most of the day. The best area is the farm animals, and that's not what we paid to see. Need more animals that kids don't normally see at a petting zoo. The train \u2026",
          "The price for getting in was not bad but the cafe is expensive for what you get. Bring your own snacks is my recommendation. Also a lot of the exhibits were under construction or the animals were hiding. The playground inside is cool though and we got to watch them walk Lucy the elephant.",
          "So many different animals and the knowledge you learn everytime your there.",
          "Amazing to see how much growth has occurred at the Zoo from when I was a kid.  Loved the Red Pandas!  Fantastic experience and can\u2019t wait to go again.  Keep up the great work, so impressive!",
          "I must admit that I was a little bit disappointed with my experience at Edmonton Valley Zoo. Numerous animals were nowhere to be seen and I was especially missing the elephants when I visited. There are several ongoing renovations which is \u2026",
          "It was cold during our visit.  Clean place,  friendly staff,  clean restrooms, good coffee.  Animals were a bit sluggish most likely due to cold, but they are still beautiful.",
          "Do yourself a favor and hit the Edmonton Zoo... It is fantastic!! They have added so many exotic animals and the zoo keepers are so knowledgeable and clearly have a passion for those career and show so much love to the animals. Can't wait to go back.",
          "Pretty good with the lights and animals. We enjoyed it",
          "Correct zoo. Like any Zoo I think, we were not able to see all the animals since they were hiding themselves far front the front or under something. But that's fair. Many others were there like the monkeys which were very funny.",
          "It's very disappointing experienced for us today. (September 23, 2019 13:40) not much animals you can see as advertised. We only see Elephant, Chicken, goats, Linx and Zebra before we go home and left the zoo. Not much to see here. I can \u2026",
          "I loved the Edmonton zoo!! The animals looked in good shape and that they are being taken care of. It is always clean and in good state.",
          "A very good Zoo that is maintained with animals even from tropical places. Has well maintained zoo with facilities like ticketing centre, restaurant, toy train, wild animals like Tiger, elephant, chickens, cows, pigs, birds of various \u2026",
          "The absolute worst zoo I have ever been to. Over half the zoo is either closed or under construction, a fact that the website does not mention. Of the exhibits that aren\u2019t under construction, a large portion are empty. The majority of the \u2026",
          "Took my daughter (6) here today, she had a blast. We burned 3 hours here and my daughter would have stayed longer if we had time. My family is moving to the area next month and we will be strongly considering buying an annual family pass as \u2026",
          "Large selection of zoo animals has a cool app",
          "Great place! Going with family or friends",
          "Lots of animals.  Nice place for a walk!  Got to see them take the Elephant for a walk through the zoo!",
          "The new renovations are fantastic! We loved the urban farm. I'm excited to see our zoo getting better and better.",
          "We went to this zoo several times this year just to see Lucy the elephant...but Lucy was never to be seen...grandson was disappointed each time..",
          "I liked the mammalian section. I am still confused about what all was there in nocturnal section. I wish for a better nocturnal room wherein animals are little visible at least. I loved the cetaceans section the way the enclosures are made!",
          "Absolutely abhorrent and shameful establishment. It's an absolute wonder why places like this still exist and even more so why people continue to go. The Edmonton valley zoo relies on funding (donations) from the public to operate. The \u2026",
          "Great zoo for being in the heart of the city. Big shout out and thank you for the rental electric wheelchairs, you made it possible for my father to enjoy the zoo also. Thank you!!",
          "Always been fond of visiting zoos around the world. Not much variety of animals but definitely different kinds of (at least i haven't seen few). Urban farm inside the zoo was new experience for me. I went there with my niece and she had \u2026",
          "It was a beautiful day, the animals were all out, it was feeding time, I enjoyed it, I just wish it was bigger. What's there is well done, just small",
          "Got to go with my kids school and enjoyed the zoo, didn't realize they had tigers and snow leapords. Some animals were not out due to the weather. Most of their recent Reno's are near completion so looking great. Train ride... Disappointing - way to short - but may improve once Reno's are complete?",
          "Had my twins 7th bday party there. It was an amazing time. Our guide Kira was super!was a super fun and affordable party.",
          "It is a while since I have been there but this is based on my last visit.  The animals really do looked \"penned up\", I mean they do not appear to have \" freedom\".  A lot of the pens do not appear natural, they appear crammed. Alright for a first zoo visit but I would not say appealing to someone who has frequented many other zoos.",
          "The zoo is great, this review is about the new restaurant at the urban farm portion of the zoo. It was terrible. \n\nIt is crazy expensive for what amounted to food a 12 year old could prepare. It was disorganized and slow, and the quality of \u2026",
          "Excellent Edmonton Valley Zoo. It's an excellent place for family visits and takes in the sights. The Zoo is small but wonderfully represented by the staff. I really enjoy the Zoo.  They work hard to provide a good home for the animals.Highly recommend!",
          "Even with rain it was beautiful. The staff r so nice to all the animals, even the human ones. Great job every one, thank u\ud83d\udc83",
          "This is a great place to take the kids and enjoy a leisurely day of strolling in the park and teaching your children about animals. Wonderful valley location!",
          "Wow it's amazing. I love the new buildings they have added and the animals. It's worth the money. Great day out",
          "Cute animals. Well kept up. Staff is very approachable and knowledgeable about each of the animals.",
          "its kind of cold and the animals outside are all freezing. please take better care of them",
          "Very nice and clean. Walking was pretty clean and nice to do walking. Cages were very secure.",
          "Good experience! I saw red panda for the first time. Clean and organized. Friendly stuff.",
          "It is a really beautiful place! I always feel complexed when I think of zoos but it makes my heart happy to see these animals have nice safe homes. They definitely do a great job of not overcrowding the animals, very clean as well. It was fun to go! Got to see a lot of animals too!",
          "Great place to take the kids. The new exhibits like the Urban Farm which let's the kids and adults have an up close and hands on view on farm animals is great.",
          "Great place to wander and just relax. The staff are very nice and helpful if you have any questions. I always enjoy my time at the zoo.",
          "Lots of cool animals, really liked the red pandas they had and the elephant.",
          "Great zoo. Lots to see. We wish there was a couple more exotic animals but all in all a great outing.",
          "I remember coming to this zoo when I was a kid and it was a fantastic time but since then it has gotten MUCH worse. The only redeeming thing about this zoo is it is cheap. Most of the animals were not there/ empty exhibits and the ones that were a couple owls, zebras and bees. I do not reccomend this place at all.",
          "Great staff. Lots of updates. \nThis is NOT the 'storyland valley zoo' of old.\nMuch needed upgrades and updates make it a great day with the family. Cost for 4 adults and a tot plus food was 70 bucks!!! Wicked price!",
          "It is the same thing \nIt is the  most worst thing that I ever  \nseen\ud83d\ude2b",
          "Love taking the kids here. Always have a blast and the new facilities are great!",
          "Went here for a birthday party !! Very well organized and great experience. The staff is very committed and the exhibits are clean and well planned. Totally recommend a day trip.",
          "Awesome day at the zoo. A lot of improvements in landscaping and building since I was last here. It is sad that herd animals like zebra are in such a small group. It's so hard to winter them over in this latitude so I'm guessing they can't keep any herds. Nice to see the Takin have started to create a small group.",
          "Very nice zoo. Obviously Lucy the elephant was my favourite. Paid over $5 for a small icecream",
          "We have not been to this zoo since we moved here in 2009.... What a joke and rip off! It's Sept 21st and a beautiful day +23. My Dad is here visiting and asked if we could go to the zoo. So 3 adults and one child $50! We asked at the front \u2026",
          "As the renovations move through the Zoo it is SUPER refreshing to visit!  Wonderful face lift, keep up the great work!",
          "The zoo is moving in a good direction. Was excited to check out the now open Urban Farm. Unfortunately it isn't fully operational. Would have liked to know that before visiting, but it wasn't clear on the website.",
          "They've been doing a fantastic job here. I came for a fundraiser and had a blast! Finally got to see the red pandas.",
          "Profit over quality of life for Lucy is a disgrace and absolutely heartless.",
          "My husband and I was in the zoo last year summer.We missed to see Lucy.",
          "Great for little kids. You want a cool. Adult experience go to Calgary zoo lol",
          "An amazing place for photographer and the visitor who love to visit every different kind of beauty of the nature. One of best place I ever visited in my whole life.",
          "It's changed a lot since I was here many years ago. And for the better! I was there with a group of kids ages 2 to 9 and they all had a blast.",
          "Great value, year pass is worth it if you end up going 3 times.",
          "Was here this April, not many animals out. What we seen was decent, but maybe not for the price we paid. Probably would be awesome in the summer!! Seen some new development/habitat being built. \nWould go back if ever in Edmonton in the summer time.",
          "Went here with family Monday 20 and bit disappointed about the price during this construction going on, some of the exhibits are empty but what I love the most is to see this elephant out of her/his cage, freely walking around but with two attendant making sure that everyone is safe. Have a great spot to take a picture",
          "Sorry to hear about poor Lucy. I don\u2019t think elephants should live alone. Send her to a sanctuary so she can be in the company of other elephants.",
          "Cute zoo, nice views and landscape, fun petting zoo and some nice cute new interactive enclosures. loved being able to see Lucy the elephant and see her up close as we ran into her as she was on her daily walk",
          "We had a fun time at the zoo today. First time there in quite a few years. Good to see the improvement and it looks like more on the way.",
          "AWESOME! Everyone who worked there was knowledgeable, helpful and caring. The exhibits were clean and the animals were adorable",
          "The zoo has really improved over the years. Great place to spend the day..have a picnic and enjoy the animals.",
          "What has happened to our zoo??? It had been years since I have gone and when free admission day came I figured it was time to revisit. Not impressed. Had I paid to go, I would be very angry. Not worth going to....even on a free day.",
          "It is the best place to take your kids it is so fun live the animals my girls love it there so many to see I would go there again",
          "One guy at gates skipped my daughter intentionally while he was explaining about an animal skull to all kids in line up 1 by 1. He have seen us but never wished or even tried to talk to me or my daughter. He was talking to all others, \u2026",
          "I was working there on Free Admission Day. It was chilly but enjoyable.",
          "We had a good time! Didn't get to see Lucy while we were there.  Couldnt find her anywhere! We visited from BC!",
          "Great place to take the Family. The Elephant is quite the attraction. Lucy is well loved",
          "Alot of random animals. The elephant was really sad. But the elephant walk was really cool. Admission is a good price but the prices for food inside are really experience!",
          "My kids love this place. Lots of walking so bring a stroller or wagon for the young ones. The little eatery is a little expensive for what you get, but the food is good and you pay for the convenience. Get the pass so you can skip the line.",
          "The Edmonton Valley Zoo has come along way in the last 20 years. They have dropped the \"storyland\" version of years gone by nicely and have become a more professional looking Zoo with a wider variety of exhibits. As I understand, most if \u2026",
          "It's a normal sized zoo but I am surprised to see that cages weren't cleaned and animals looked sick. They were not in pairs. Some cages have a single animal who looks so isolated and sad.",
          "They have renovated an Urban Barn with a petting zoo. They have a new natural playground there. The Red Pandas now have a pedway bridge outside between their two 'natural' play areas. And 'Lucy' our favourite Asian elephant us doing very well.\nShe obviously loves her handlers whi treat her extremely well.\u2665\ufe0f",
          "The zoo has made several improvements and is a great place to spend the day. The new areas and buildings are beautiful.",
          "Great small zoo in the city. The new farm animal area was especially enjoyable.",
          "Wonderful but give yourself at least 4 to 6 hrs to see the whole zoo they have a concession at gate and in west side of zoo . Portapotties placed thru out. Wheel chair accessible every where .",
          "My husband and I go to the zoo almost every week, and we LOVE the time we spend here. I've been to many zoos in the US and Canada, and the Edmonton Valley Zoo is definitely one that we are happy to have so close to home. The animals seem \u2026",
          "Enjoyed the new additions and watching learning about elephants with the family. The gift shop was full of exciting things as well.",
          "Horrible disgusting place I'd never go again nor would I ever recommend anybody come here. Most pathetic Zoo I've ever been to.",
          "Some of the enclosure looks really old and looks like a pretty depressing place for animals. The do have a new wing for farm animals",
          "This is the worst zoo I\u2019ve ever been too.\nThe enclosures are  terrible and so sad. \nnocturnal section, you couldn\u2019t see anything. \nThey have more house pets and farm animals than anything. 0/10 recommend. \n\nI saw no kids, families or employees smiling. Horrific",
          "Great exhibits, animals looked happy, healthy and lots of keepers around to educate guests.\n\nConcessions nicely spread around the zoo, along with washrooms.\n\nOnly thing that would make it even better is a larger selection of wildlife.",
          "Granddaughter had fun. Only downside was either the animals happened to be sleeping or the enclosures were empty.  Didn't see the elephant or zebra.",
          "Zoo is always a great place to spend time with  your family.  Got renovated a bit. Added some new attractions",
          "Getting better every time I go!",
          "There is this one thing which I love about the valley zoo is the \"TALK\" . They talk about various animals and let you take pictures with them!",
          "Had a great visit. Looking forward to seeing the Edmonton Valley Zoo completely redone. It's looking good.",
          "Highlight of zoo was glacier play area and Lucy the elephant going for her walk.\n\nPoor food services. Expensive, slow service, rude and unhelpful food services staff as well as a restaurant that smells like a barnyard (as it is beside the \u2026",

          "It seems like not much has changed in the past 20-30 years for this zoo. I visited it recently and felt quite sad and disappointed that the majority of the animals are in such small confined cages. If they could just make better use of the \u2026",
          "Edmonton Valley Zoo seemed alive even in May. I just gave it a try thinking it would be less busy as summer was yet to come.\n\nWell, the place was full with different kids and student group and there were several talks scheduled at different \u2026",
          "So much fun for kids.  Even though we kept missing Lucy the elephant, we had a fun time on our class field trip!",
          "Went to the zoo with my mother yesterday. Zoo is Beautiful and has amazing green grass. You can actually see the animals up close and go for a walk with Lucy the elephant. Despite what other people said on here I reccomend the zoo to \u2026",
          "The zoo is kinda of depressing great for the little ones but as an adult you can really see what's going on. Especially if you just look at the way they treat Lucy the elephant. They clearly care more about money then animals and it sickens \u2026",
          "This is a very nice place. The place is big, clean and the animal habitats are well maintained. Some places smelled pretty smelly but that's the animal's fault. Like any zoo they have explainations for each animals and \"did you knows\". The \u2026",
          "Decent zoo. Nice to walk through. Usually go every year. Good places to have a little picnic.",
          "An excellent day out with the family. Great programming, great exhibits. Updating things constantly.",
          "Loved the improvements and to see Lucy walking around.  Red pandas have a great area too.",
          "having fun in the afternoon. A lot of animals there. Actually it surprises me. I thought it's a really small zoo.they have North american river otter, skunks, kea, makira outpost, red panda, urban farm, elephant, red fox, large carnivores \u2026",
          "Good for little kids, but not as big or well put together as other zoo's (Calgary)",
          "Needs a cleaning and there were many empty compounds.  Kids loved.  Went for red eyed frog but cod not find.",
          "Great little place,  pricey but nice.",
          "It was okay, a bit smaller than expected but that's fine and I think I must of gone on a bad day as there were many empty enclosures and some construction work going on. I understand that work has to be done to further the zoo but if I'd of known I would have visited at a different time :)",
          "It was good! I honestly thought there would be more but overall I had fun!",
          "The 40 Acres restaurant here is a miserable fail. It is advertised as their urban farm restaurant bringing local food inspiration to the menu. \n\nThe reality is this place is disgusting and very high prices for the quality of food they \u2026",
          "Nice lights during winter, but not much to see",
          "Not as good as Calgary but dang it they still have an elephant. So that is a big win.",
          "It was awsome, but geez them poor animals caged up, just hope they be treated good in there, over all great place",
          "This zoo is disgusting and keeps a lone elephant in a tiny concrete enclosures she just paces back and forth... it\u2019s so sad! I will never be back",
          "Worked a popcorn stand for MaxWell Family fun night at the zoo. Great crowd,  lots of excited happy kids.",
          "Gotta see Lucy walking around,  that was pretty cool. And we saw a red panda pooping. It was cool!",
          "The 40 FOOD COURT IS DISGUSTING!!! DIDNT HAVE ITEMS.  BUNS HAD MOLD. KIDS WORKING SPITTING ON PEOPLE FOOD!!!\nNEVER EAT THERE WORST EVER!!!",
          "I used to love this zoo, but am noticing that some of the animals showed their distress by repetitious behavior. I love that we can see what these animals look like in real life but feel sorry for some that dont seem happy or relaxed.",
          "I love the animals here. And although I always end up coming in the winter time there is always a decent selection. I find they are concentrating more on the \"merchandise\" and \"retail\" stuff than working on the exhibits and animals. I see \u2026",
          "Some animals have great encolusures. While others are shoved into tiny \"cages\" where they cant properly live. Especially the hawks and eagle, who you can tell just want to fly. Sad.",
          "With the annual pass this place is a great day of movement out of the house for the kids.",
          "Last week, and again this week I decided to go check out the zoo with my family. I had a great time, there is lots to see, all of the exhibits were great, and the staff helped answer questions we had. Planning to go back soon.",
          "It's a small zoo! But perfect for little kids to see in a couple of hours. If you have a kid who loves looking at animals..they have an annual pass which can be best used in summer in my opinion. They are open late on one day of the week in summer and it's works to be a great picnic spot too",
          "Anybody offering more than one star on their review obviously has never been to a real zoo. Petland has a better variety of animals. This zoo looked more like a remand center for animals. High walls, small enclosures, and a feeling of \u2026",
          "It\u2019s great there! What I live about it is that on the other hand, by bringing people and animals together, zoos have the potential to educate the public about conservation issues and inspire people to protect animals and their habitats. ... \u2026",
          "Great place to take your family. Very enjoyable venue. Food services left aittle to be desired.",
          "Elephants walking around was awesome! A lot of the enclosures were closed",
          "It\u2019s not a great zoo, but it\u2019s worth a visit if there is nothing else to do.",
          "It was nice....but I went to see the red panda, but no red panda to be found....I didn't like the elephant house, it was scary, looked like a prison for a monster",
          "It was good... and Lucy the elephant was so cool...and Meghan the spokesperson for Lucy was totally awesome...she I retracted so go with the people in answering their questions",
          "Not much to see. I found 1 ferris wheel and 1 train ride that my son could enjoy... but the zoo is pretty small. You could walk through it in 30 minutes. Dont plan this as an all day thing..",
          "It's a really good place for kids and big kids, had a blast, haven't been there in years, they've made some changes and it was awesome",
          "The  new urban farm was great, my 2 kids loved it.",
          "Beautiful zoo! The animals all looked very happy, energetic, and well cared for. We were able to get close to Steve & Beau the otters while keepers did an up-close-and-personal demonstration and we were able to see Lucy the elephant who \u2026",
          "We visited the zoo today. My 7 year was on a school trip, and we tagged along with our 2 years old. Mind you it\u2019s spring and the it\u2019s warm but not for all the animals to be out and about. We saw the Leopard, wolves, a tiger, bunch of zebras \u2026",
          "I really enjoyed the different views just around the zoo being in the valley, but I think the zoo needs alot of work to really fill it in. There was alot of spots under construction, empty spots all over with no animals, you have to really \u2026",
          "Fun day out with the family, but the food options (moreso quality and service) left much to be desired. Next time I\u2019m packing a lunch for the kidlets to avoid disappointment.",
          "Not a very big zoo but nice and have lots of spots to bring your family and have a picnic lunch.",
          "The Edmonton Valley zoo is okay, the renovations were defiantly needed however the timing in which these renovations are taking place is poorly executed. The renovations could have been completed during winter months. \n\nThe animals are \u2026",
          "Great place to spend some time with your kids.",
          "We have been coming to the Zoo for many years and have always enjoyed it. It has become dated in some areas but in the last couple of years with new funding it is now being updated.  I do think that it would be so much nicer if there were a \u2026",
          "Positives: cheap admission fees, great gift shop, clean grounds and washrooms, new urban farm looks good and the entrance to the zoo is very modern and appealing.\nNegatives: small cages for animals, lots of closed sections in the zoo, \u2026",
          "I loved it! It was well laid out, signage was excellent, and the information was at a great level for kids.",
          "We went in the afternoon and alot of the animals were napping, Lucy the elephant wasn't in her own and nowhere to be seen. The new buildings were very nice and there is alot of places to sit. I found the map was abit confusing to get around not to miss anything. If they painted the path it would be easier.",
          "It's a great place to go and to bring your family. They have a lot of new enclosures and some activities to do.",
          "A great place to visit with the family.\nSpecially great for kids and animal lovers.\nAll animals seem to be very well taken care of and everything is nice and clean.\n\nThere are lots of attractions for kids, including Mary go rounds.\nThe \u2026",
          "Love it here.  It's easy to get around.  Wishes there was a train that you could ride on instead of walking.  But otherwise it's good.",
          "Lots of animals in a very exciting environment. An encounter with animals you will always remember",
          "All good for the price! I\u2019ve seen better but for 15$ it\u2019s perfect",
          "Upgrades are nice.  Good for families.",
          "Small Zoo undergoing massive upgrade to enclosures.  New areas of the zoo are extremely impressive.  New food choices have enhanced the zoos appeal.",
          "Went to the new 40 acres restaurant. It was decent food but they need to train their staff in customer service better, simplify their restaurant menu, and speed up food service.",
          "Great place for the kids to learn some new things and explore",
          "great experience for couples & families! A wide variety of animals, great removations! definitely worth the admission a great 1/2 to full day",
          "Seems like there are less animals every year. The weather was nice, but was slightly underwhelmed. I heard the Calgary Zoo is better.",
          "Has gotten better since last time I was there. Enjoyed myself.",
          "Zoo-minescence wasn't what I expected but  kids had fun.",
          "So much to see, and great for kids. Loved the interactive shows!",
          "Everything here is very nice. Even with the current economy and funding they are keeping upto pace. I see more constructions going on for more livestock and interesting creatures. Lucy as always is the attraction :)",
          "Lovely place for the kids. Would be nice if more exhibits were open. Gift shop had lots of stuff and the restaurant served good lunch food.",
          "Construction is making it much better. Love the new petting zoo. Those upset about Lucy need to do their actual research and not believe the first thing you read.",
          "Great time and very accessible. Also has kids day camp during the summer",
          "The Edmonton Valley Zoo is definitely a good place to spend the day with friends or family. The animals were great and the enclosures were nicely maintained and clean.\n\nMoreover, I love how cheap the admission fees were, especially the \u2026",
          "The Valley Zoo is such a magical place this time of year.  The Zoominesence festival going on with the lights is amazing.  It's a great place to go with the family and take in the sights.  Take the kids, learn about the animals and get a \u2026",
          "Lots of fun, neat rocky play and climb area for kids. Very informational and friendly staff, but half the animals were not visible so that kind of takes the point out of going to the zoo.",
          "We did a Zoo Encounter and it was the best day ever!! Just go!",
          "not enough covered areas when it's raining. there isnt a lot of animals. feels dingy",
          "Went during Zoominesence, the lights were very stunning.  The zoo itself is beautiful during the winter and we were able to see several animals we don't normally see in the heat of the summer. The size of this zoo makes it really great for \u2026",
          "It's a disgrace that this zoo is already for yeras without paved parking for the visitors...also the guy who works as a cashier at the Chapman's store is rude and forces you to choose quickly ice cream and type, since as a group you don't \u2026",
          "Decent zoo but needs more places throughout for washrooms and/or to fill up water bottles.",
          "Great zoo to visit with family. Even in the middle of the winter it had a great variety of animals to see and learn about as well as a great light display. Easy to follow paths and very helpful staff. Happy to have taken the time to visit while in Edmonton.",
          "With the construction finished, it's a brand new zoo that promises to be a great time for everyone.",
          "Good price for a zoo. Small friendly environment. Not to crowded.",
          "Not bad but needs more exotic animals did have a good time though",
          "Fun to take the little ones to but it's just tiny. And bring your own food or eat before because that cafe outside the entrance is ridiculously overpriced",
          "What a lovely way to spend a day. I wish there were more animals out though.",
          "Visited during Zoomenescence. Will definitely be back as was our first visit during this Christmas light show. Absolutely amazing however not many critters viewed as too dark. Lights were magical. Very icy in spots due to rain the other day and dispute gravel being down.",
          "Always an amazing place to explore.",
          "It's getting to be a very good zoo.  Keep improving!!",
          "Something for everyone. And still growing and improving. Get a season pass. Lots to see and do.",
          "The new exhibits are great, upgrades are very well done.",
          "It\u2019s a zoo, it deserves not even one star. Sickening how we pay money to see animals trapped in cages for the rest of their lives :(",
          "Got to see Lucy the snake out for a \"walk\" so cool!!",
          "We had an enjoyable time visiting here.  It seems numerous areas or cages are empty or blocked off.",
          "Great place to enjoy a nice day with the family",
          "Nice place to bring the kids don't listen to the vegans or snowflakes the animals are taken well care off.",
          "The Valley Zoo is great! Sometimes they even bring the animals out to walk around!",
          "Even though is not as big as Calgary zoo I still like going here. I get a calm & warm environment, I enjoy going here \ud83d\ude0a",
          "We went around Father's day and it seems like half the exhibits were closed or empty or we can see the animals. Luckily my daughter is only one and doesn't pay attention anyway",
          "This was the first time I took my son (almost a year old) to the zoo, and we had a lot of fun walking through and seeing all the animals. We went with some friends, and it was a lovely activity for the morning.",
          "Best Zoo in Edmonton!!! It really is nice to see some development within the zoo. My family and I havent been in years and decided to take an afternoon over our Christmas break to check it out. The Sea Lion exhibit is amazing. I remember \u2026",
          "Every summer my kids visit this place . They want to see Lucy .nice place for relaxing with family.",
          "Had a fun day with my niece and her friend",
          "Staff were fun and knowledgeable. Great experience with the kids.",
          "Off season events @  Halloween, Christmas  etc. to entertain the whole family.",
          "Lots of new exhibits and more to come. A great and relatively inexpensive way to spend a day.",
          "Decently priced and clean. My toddler loved it.",
          "Wasnt overly what i expected alot of the animals where not out or they where behind some meany fences and building and trees that you could barley see them still and nice place but think it could be opened up a little bit and more veiw freindly environment",
          "3 stars since the bathrooms we used were nice and clean. Otherwise we barely saw any animals, quite a disappointment for the entry fee. Honestly, not sure what we paid for..",
          "Great little zoo close to home! Best to visit in the summer - but I have gone in winter and spring too. Kids under 2 are free! Currently lots of construction and some animals not out (May 2018). Once construction is complete it will be great again! We still enjoyed our visit.",
          "Looking really good after the face lift. I enjoyed the new urban farm area.",
          "It's pretty good, but not the best zoo.  They are slowly updating exhibits so that it does not look so dated.... But the Zoo still has an old feel.to it... But the staff and events do a great job at offering interactive and fun events.",
          "Better now since reno's",
          "They really need a better map and signs to get around!  Very old buildings and enclosures, poor animals seem bored out of their minds. Need to do better taking care of these animals, I understand that this place is small and old a has no money. Should have been shut down instead of renovated, just my opinion.",
          "Had a great day at the zoo today it was free to the whole city so it was a zoo if you know what I mean lol the only thing that sucked most of the stuff was closed so we didn't get to see all the stuff we wanted",
          "Great zoo for all ages.  I love seeing Lucy the Elephant out and about.",
          "The quality of the Edmonton zoo has drastically improved in the last few years, the  animals are visibly happier and staff are far more friendly and approachable, most of the staff have a passion for animal welfare and conservation, very \u2026",
          "Definetly not what i expected. Animals were great. Place was fairly busy and staff was outstanding. Only food choices at the time were 8$ sandwiches, pastries, icecream and vending machine food. (They were in a transition period) sadly we didn't get to see lucy. Overall a decent experience.",
          "It's a cute little zoo, about the right size for kids to be entertained and see some wonderful animals. I know zoos can be a bit contentious and I know animals being in their wild habitat is best. But the staff were all kind and caring for \u2026",
          "Was there today    alittle disappointed  not many animals considering its Edmonton Zoo , n so many empty gages.. Lots of ppl were wanting to see Lucy (myself included ) but never got to c her in the 3 hrs we were there ..I went back to Lucy's area 3 times hoping she would be there but nope .",
          "An absolutely wonderful day spent wandering and looking at the animals. Always so much to see.",
          "Great family fun in winter.",
          "Nice place and well maintained ! Couldn\u2019t see Lucy, the elephant. Some of the areas were closed . Maybe summer should be the ideal time to visit. Most of the animals and birds were sleeping and inactive. Hope they are waiting for summer too !",
          "Toddler liked it, good for a walk around, bring a picnic, short train ride for kids and a sketchy merry go round. Similar feel to other Edmonton facilities, can be a bit crowded on nice days, avoid on free days.",
          "Great place but the flow is a little off.",
          "Its a nice zoo. They are slowly modernizing it and the new exhibits are fantastic.  It isn't big big and doesn't have a lot of exotic animals but is a decent size and great for smaller kids.\n\nPlus probably one of the only places you will get to see an elephant out for a walk (sad story in a way).",
          "The upgrades and renovations are looking great. Enclosures are well landscaped looking lush and full.",
          "A definite improvement from what used to be same old. Many new improvements and changes with proper size animal exhibits.",
          "Came here during a beer fest. Not so bad!",
          "Beautiful modern facility. Great picnic spots",
          "This zoo is great however when we were there this summer they were doing some renovations and half of the zoo was closed off... Lucy was incredible they took her for her afternoon walk while we were there and it was amazing to be so close to such a huge majestic animal!!!",
          "Such a wonderful place you can picnic and enjoy the beautiful scenery also get to see all kind of animals.",
          "It's the best place for little ones, and they learn a lot.",
          "Beautiful place. Family favorite",
          "Excellent place for kids in Edmonton... everyone should visit not only for elephant lucy, there are still more amazing animals...",
          "They do a great job and their rates are very reasonable.",
          "It is a great Zoo to visit! I got lots of great pictures of the various animals!",
          "Never gets old going to this zoo!",
          "We really enjoyed this medium sized zoo. Loved the fact that there were lots of places in the shade to sit and rest. We were entertained by the red pandas especially the one that tried to make it's escape up the stairs out the door following the handler. Find the food expensive but hopefully it supports the zoo.",
          "This is a great place to take the family on a nice day. Some spots could use updating but it seems like theyre adding new attractions every time I go there.",
          "Love love love the elephant walks. We have run into Lucy outside her enclosure more times than in it.",
          "Love this place.  Just gets better every year.",
          "Grandkids love animals.",
          "On a nice warm day like it was today, many of the animals will be sleeping, or hiding in their dens to stay cool. Try to visit on a more temperate day perhaps to see more critters playing about. We did get to see Lucy the Elephant go for a \u2026",
          "A super fun place to bring the family!",
          "Nice place to spend a morning or afternoon. Many wild creatures on display. A must see.",
          "The renovations are looking so good. It's getting better and better for young kids!",
          "Enjoyed visiting. Miss Humptydumpty- was great for picture taking.",
          "Great time! Unfortunately not many animals out though.",
          "Wonderful place to spend the day with the kids. The construction takes a little bit to navigate around but exciting to see upgrades to the area for future visits. Kids loved seeing all of the animals and playing at the activity areas around the zoo",
          "Went during winter on -30 windchill conditions so a large portion of the outdoor sections were closed. Even then its still worth checking out for the indoors/climatized areas and see some cool af bearded dragons and pythons. If you want to see the birds of prey, bring multiple layers. It will help tons",
          "New exhibits are fantastic, staff is lovely, not too busy and lots of demos to drop in on",
          "I really enjoyed their winter lights and activities. The works of art were beautiful and there were lots of interactive stations and photo ops. I got a Chai Latte in the cafe to drink while we wandered and it was quite good",
          "Kids had fun on free train ride and merry-go-round.",
          "I liked all the habitats, I just wished they had a more bright and fun atmosphere. It was in a lot of construction so I can't really fault them for that. The staff we did pass near were friendly and informative",
          "Our family rented the Otter Room for a Christmas party and thoroughly enjoyed our time. The kids (and adults) loved watching the otters play from a large window right in the room. We also had a zoo attendant do animal presentations, she \u2026",
          "Had a great time. Staff were all very helpful",
          "We went Sunday june 30, we came around 12pm and it was already busy with a long line but surprisingly very fast. Forgot to carry my sunscreen and needed it for my baby, fortunately the zootique shop had some sunscreen available but it was a \u2026",
          "They are really making some nice changes to the zoo. Unfortunately, we were not able to see Lucy while we were there.",
          "I loved the zoo because I love animals and was fun seeing all the different types of animals",
          "Always enjoy the zoo ita a wo derfulafternoon activities for kids and i am happytogo",
          "I feel like this shouldn't be called a Zoo but rather a Sanctuary. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The programs and daily schedule is easy to find. My advice is..... don't go there expecting to see a lot. Some days you do, some \u2026",
          "It's the best zoo at this latitude.",
          "Lots of good walking and finally got to see the otters!",
          "Oh my God! Love the nature of it, healthy animals and playful. Get here and see for yourself.",
          "The grand kids love it here",
          "Such an iconic story behind this amazing piece of Edmonton, the early years the zoo was pretty sparse but now that money has been injected into this awesome facility, super modern exhibits , lots of free parking and the staff are always amazing, dont compare our zoo to San Diego but ours is pretty awesome",
          "Great family friendly place.",
          "Must visit place! Very nice",
          "We went for zoo lights. It was so cold. A nice walk, however the paths were so icy. I think a better job could have been done.",
          "Went there winter and summer. Best to go when it's sunny out, where there's more animals out. Good food too.",
          "It's a beautiful well maintained zoo..loved it",
          "This zoo could use upgrades especially to the wolf enclosure. Not enough room for the animals over all.",
          "Always a great experience.  A couple detours due to construction but it's nice to see things getting upgraded and changed for the better. Animals always seem so happy and well looked after. Price is also a huge bonus. Very family cost friendly.",
          "Such a lovely place.... With sweet birds nd animals.... Nd the view is osam.",
          "Some attractions were under construction so not available. Ok as far as zoos go. Not a 10 but certainly not a 1.",
          "Went to see Zoominesence? and what a wonderful display of Christmas lighting. Absolutely magical. Was too dark to see many animals but the lights and colors made up for this. Walkways, despite gravel down, were very slippy in spots. Will certainly attend this event again as was our first visit during this annual celebration.",
          "If ANYONE from Edmonton is wealthy and would like to give back to the city---- *please* invest in the Edmonton Valley Zoo.  \n\nThis place is full of great, five-star employees who are friendly and knowledgeable, but the zoo itself is more of \u2026",
          "Still a decent amount of construction going. It feels like you only have about half the zoo to actually see.",
          "Even though elephants are extremely social animals and need the company of other elephants for their emotional well-being, Lucy has been kept alone for years at the Edmonton Valley Zoo. Because of Alberta\u2019s frigid winters\u2014which are \u2026",
          "I was there a little early for spring and summer this year and most are under construction. I believe before summer everything will be ready and it will be exciting!",
          "Things have really changed for the better. The Zoo has become both a conservatory and education centre connecting young people to the importance of wildlife. Holding my office's customer appreciation day Maxwell Polaris Kevin Grenier was \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful round of renovations that have been completed at the zoo. The habitats and exhibits are well done and offer excellent views of the animals. \n\nThe staff to animal ratio seems very high and on top of that the elephant is often just walking around to the delight of my children.",
          "Great place that improves each time. People may expect more from a zoo but take a look around and see the work being done.\nLucy looked happy and the animals  were for the most part all visible",
          "This place is looking awesome! With new exhibits and atttactions, this summer is looking like Edmonton Valley Zoo will be hot spot to check out for all ages!",
          "A great zoo for Edmonton. Can't beat seeing Lucy the elephant do her walk around the park.",

          "Very nice people to deal with.",
          "It was good it takes approximatly 2 hrs to see all animals",
          "Small but enjoyable zoo. Well maintained and animals seem to be all in a good spot. Was able to see Zoominescence: A Festival of Light, nice light displays throughout the zoo",
          "It's laid out to be friendly for disabled people.",
          "Had a great time, layout is good. Unfortunately we didn't get to see Lucy but overall had a good experience.",
          "Very disappointing. Paddle boats closed, train closed, elephant exhibit closed, ice cream closed. Sold out of coffee, tea and desserts at concession. Told the front desk and they told me it should be all open... terrible experience.",
          "It has come a long way and the zoo is doing a lot to improve but it is still mediocre compared to other zoos. The concessions are very expensive but I do always have a great time when I go.",
          "Love the valley zoo, they have changed so much since I was younger and really embraced the idea of naturalizing environments for animals. Lucy, of course is one of the main attractions, she is and will always be a beautiful addition to the \u2026",
          "Pretty good and fun but very crowded and it didn't smell great",
          "My rating will eventually get better but for right now we went the May long weekend to visit the zoo and paid $50 to get in unfortunately over half the zoo is closed due to Renovations so really it felt like a waste of money to even bother \u2026",
          "Love the new petting zoo but it needs more animals, like pigs, ponies and cow.",
          "It is the best place for kids to see animals that they have not seen before",
          "We went during May long weekend. We had our annual passes so the line wasn\u2019t something we had to worry about getting in. They are doing some construction on new structures but nothing that got in the way of seeing all the animals. It\u2019s \u2026",
          "Edmonton Valley Zoo is a small zoo. It is a nice walk for adults with quite a few interesting animals and very exciting for children. It was neat when they took their elephant out for a walk, the kids in our group really enjoyed it. The \u2026",
          "Went at night to see the light set up. Everything was amazing, the animals where very active, wolves howled, otters play fighting, elephant playing tag and hide and go seek with an attendant. Had a great time and will be going again",
          "Everything Very beautifully set-up.",
          "There weren't many animals out- imo calgary is better",
          "My kids quite enjoy the Edmonton Valley Zoo. Nice surroundings to immerse yourself in nature.",
          "Why is there no pool for the elephant? Why is there only one elephant? Isn't that consider cruelty? I love zoo's but I won't be supporting this one, on the city of Edmonton website, it was mentioned that the people are this elephants herd. \u2026",
          "Awesome way to spend an afternoon",
          "Great way to spend a day with family and friends.",
          "Had some interesting stuff but animal welfare isn't much of a priority!",
          "A picturesque zoo, with something for all ages to appreciate..",
          "Horrible waste of money I will not return back sadly. I will be driving to Calgary next time I want to take my family to the zoo. 45$ later and we saw otters,seals,one elephant,some birds,a fox,two tigers,two wolves,wild life that I can see \u2026",
          "I always enjoy the Zoo. They work hard to provide a good home for the animals.",
          "So happy they brought back the nachos from before",
          "It's a decent zoo. I like the new red panda exhibit. They've really improved on the original bones. They're events are great. We end up going about once a year in average. It's no Calgary Zoo but it's got its own attractions.",
          "Amazing new urban farm really like how there improving the facilities and making new and exciting learning opportunities for children to learn!",
          "Smaller zoo, but still lots of fun. Nice walk on a sunny Sunday.",
          "Not horrible but does not compare to Calgary Zoo.",
          "Although i would love to see more exhibits in Edmonton Valley Zoo in near future- this is still a good one.  You can visit the zoo in less than 2 hours altogether. Its a lot fun in the summer than in the winter to visit the zoo. During \u2026",
          "Our zoo definitely needs some improvements.  Kind of boring in some areas.",
          "Experience was great as a foreigner... Though quite a few exhibits were out of order, including the Arctic zone",
          "Deeply troubled by the living conditions of Lucy the elephant.  She has been there for 41 years.   No water to soak her joints or cool off. No mud pit to protect her from sunburn or bugs. No companions for the social creature she is. No \u2026",

          "Amazing place To visit and see wildlife. However, there are few animals",
          "Fantastic zoo! Great staff and awesome picnic spots! A great way to spend a day with the kids or by yourself. There is some construction as they are upgrading the zoo so not all of the exhibits are open. Bring big spray and sunscreen!",
          "Doesn't matters how often you went always you'll spend great time",
          "We have the Edmonton Nature Pass and it's so easy to come and let the little guy just run and see the animals. Not worried about having to see all the animals when we come.\n\nDefiantly a big fan of the new Red Panda exhibit!",
          "Was a wonderful way to spend the day with the grandchildren",
          "Great place to take your family. Depressing to see these amazing animals locked up.",
          "Love this place.  So much to see and for all ages.",
          "Love the new upgrades, but the zoo still have a great deal of work to be world class.",
          "Great visit not all exhibits were open but still a fun time",
          "Instead of Edmonton being named \"the city of champions\" we should name it \"home of the worlds most depressed elephant\"\nHer enclosure is far too small for one elephant and her indoor living area is disgusting and the cement is crumbling \u2026",
          "Half the zoo was closed for construction, however still charged full price to see a quarter of the usual animals. Didn't offer any signs saying zoo was under construction till after you pay, a little dirty tactic, but still a bit of fun.",
          "They do such a good job here. Well done Edmonton Zoo!",
          "Not the best zoo but it\u2019s great for kids. We got the year pass, which is very reasonably priced, and found that coming here was our go to activity last Summer. Will be buying another pass this year. It doesn\u2019t take too long to walk around \u2026",
          "Loved zoo lights.",
          "Went here for mothers day 2018. If it wasn't for friends and family, this place would have been a total bore. Only few animals were out, which seems to be the norm for this zoo. I can pay same price in Calgary and have tons more fun. Either \u2026",
          "good size if you have small children. Lots for them to see.",
          "It is finally becoming a zoo. I Love zoo's but Edmonton has had a pretty sad zoo for a long time. They are under construction again, and i can't wait for them to be done....its going to be awesome! They really did change in the past 9 years, and i hope they continue adding animals and expanding.",
          "Everyone was out in full force offering information in the animals and running the rides even with the massive rainstorm Canada Day",
          "I went to the Calgary Zoo early in September and was very impressed.  I hadn't been to the Valley Zoo since a child so I was glad to take advantage of free admission day.  There is no comparison between the two.  The Edmonton Valley Zoo \u2026",
          "Meh. Every time we have taken the kids here, most exhibits are closed and the only viewable animals are the birds and monkeys. Probably the last time for us.",
          "I was super upset that there werent many animals. Also there were no workers around ,the water for the otters was super gross, there was garbage in there... no elephant and there are many animals that were alone.",
          "I took my granddaughters there and we had an amazing time. What I did find very difficult though was navigating our way around. It would be very helpful if there were # signs as you walked along to cross reference with the hand out we were \u2026",
          "3 stars beca there is always room for improvement",
          "Do they walk an elephant in the public paths in Calgary? I thought not. Edmonton Valley Zoo is worth an annual to biannual trip.",
          "Under construction but still charged us full price. Seem like half of the zoo was closed or marked as outabounds where we weren't allowed to go. Should have only been charged half price we were pretty disappointed. I would hold off until \u2026",
          "Like to see more native Alberta animals, bears, moose, elk...",
          "Nice place to visit during summer season...kids are welcomed\nTicket prices are:\n1. Adult: 11.75\n2. Family: 37 $ (7 members)",
          "Great place, took the family here and had a blast",
          "Not to many animals were out, but it was hot! Nice walk!",
          "You can spend a good part of a day here! Kids love it. There is a section where you can pet some domestic animals. Lots of open spaces for kids to run around.",
          "Not exactly what I imagine/except. Got to see a sheep, goat and roaster, nothing compare to the calgary zoo.",
          "My son attended Story time at the zoo here! The camp was amazing! I love how many caregivers they had working with the children! \n\nEven though the air quality was poor, my son was able to experience the zoo, for 4 days! He learned so much!",
          "Absolutely lovely evening. The farm animals experience  Moo at the Zoo.",
          "Love the time spent with my niece.",
          "Average Zoo. For a Canadian city the size of Edmonton I expect better, especially with northern animals. Quite often multiple exhibits are closed. Also pretty much no concessions are open at time of zoo opening and only open 1-2 hrs after. \u2026",
          "Against my better judgment I went. If you feeling good in life and feel like you could use a dose of depression this is the place for you. Small barren cages for alot of the animals. Alberta needs a wild life park with lots of proper space \u2026",
          "A lot of the animals were not available or areas under construction",
          "Great place but needs more animals",
          "Nice zoo. Exhibits change of course for different and new sights.",
          "The only complaints I have are there arent enough garbage cans, a good walking flow for some or the new exhibits and lastly their are many norrow door ways for many if the new exhibits where the double doors have a solid metal pole in the middle making it impossible for strollers/wheel chairs to access these new areas.",
          "This is basically a nice park and picnic spot with $11 entry fee!!! The selection of animals on display was appaling and a complete joke. Most of the animals were indoors and parts of the zoo were closed off for maintenance. Why would you open for business if the zoo is not fully functional??  It is a one star from me I'm afraid!!!",
          "I prefer this zoo over Calgary. It feels more populated with animals for its size, where you see more exhibits for how far you walk. I\u2019ve visited in both summer and winter, and although I do prefer it in the summertime, it was a very \u2026",
          "That the  Zoo keeps a single elephant when by nature they are designed for a herd and family life, is beyond my comprehension.  Elephants are sentient which means that they can feel emotions, mourn, express joy and get depressed - and Lucy, \u2026",
          "Their maps that they hand out should have better photo quality . They're hard to read because they're very blurry. The photo is enlarged, so on a computer it probably looks fine but the hand outs are no good. \n\nThe zoo is well kept and \u2026",
          "I give 5 starts to the hard work employees who work here, but Edmontonians deserve better quality.",
          "I have nothing nice to say about this zoo, the fact they allow an elephant to be kept on its own in a mostly artificial surrounding is unbearable. When will we learn that animals aren\u2019t to be kept as objects for our entertaintment?? \u2026",
          "My son loved all the displays, rock park and the train ride.",
          "I was there during renovations, it was still pretty good.  Looking forward to going back when it's complete.",
          "We went here for a birthday party and were part of a zoo safari.  We were given an awesome guided tour of the facility and animals.  The kids got to interact with a rabbit and an armadillo.  It was a joy to see their reactions and excitement at the zoo.  A good time was had by all.",
          "Awesome place! Good experience. Great to have a nice zoo in the heart of our city, in the river valley. Well maintained. Nice staff.",
          "Wnet to see the elephant but not there.\nDidn't feel like the place was open.\nLacking any sign of customer service.\nHad to ask another visitor for information.\nGirl at the cashier was very nice though.",
          "Nice little zoo mostly Canadian and North American wildlife exhibits however still under construction, there is a coffee shop and eatery",
          "This gets substantially better every year",
          "Not worth the money, alot of the exhibits are \"under construction\" not alot of places to stop and sit especially for moms trying to feed little one's",
          "A very reasonably priced zoo. If you haven't been in a few years you should really check it out, enclosures have been improved. There is a distinct lack of food services, so pack a lunch. The merry-go-round and train are fun for little kids and are included with your admission."

        "wiki": "The Muttart Conservatory is a botanical garden located in the North Saskatchewan river valley, across from the downtown core in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. One of the best-known landmarks of Edmonton, the conservatory consists of three city-operated greenhouses, public gardens, as well as four feature pyramids for display of plant species found across three biomes, with the fourth pyramid hosting as a seasonal display. A fifth minor skylight pyramid lights up the central foyer.\nA donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining funding supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway, is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger pyramids are 660 square metres (7,100 sq ft) in area, and the two medium-sized ones are 410 square metres (4,400 sq ft) in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants.\n\n\n== Biomes ==\nThe Temperate pyramid houses plants typical of temperate climates, from such zones as the southern Great Lakes, Australia, and even the mountainous areas of Asia. Near the entrance and fed by a stream is a bog area, with white water lilies and parrot's feather. The bog merges into a woodland with mostly eastern deciduous trees and low shrubs but including redwoods, cedars and pampas grass. Eucalyptus trees and flowering shrubs complement the Australian section. In the woodland floor and alpine section are many tiny flowering plants, some native to Alberta and others from all over the world. Carefully controlled environmental conditions allow the plants to go dormant in winter and burst into spring growth of green leaves and colourful blooms.\nThe plants from the Arid pyramid come from hot and cold dry areas spanning five continents. They share an ability to thrive in environments with dry air, irregular moisture and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. In spring 2013, the Arid Pyramid featured an Agave Americana plant bloom which reached a height of 30 feet before reaching the top of the pyramid. This plant was planted a year after the Muttart Conservatory first opened.\nThe Tropical pyramid provides an enormous diversity of species; under a canopy of tall palms, banana and weeping fig are orchids, various hibiscus and the bird of paradise. The plants come from tropical rainforests, evergreen forests or grasslands, and are often showy and bright. A waterfall cascades into the centre of the pyramid where small fish and water lilies make their home. This pyramid has also been home in the past to a kiwi bird and a sloth. On March 11, 2013, the bud to an imported Amorphophallus titanum plant (commonly known as the corpse flower) budded and bloomed here on April 22.The Feature pyramid offers seasonal displays that change several times per year, focusing on themed displays and seasonal celebrations. \nOther amenities at the facility are an outdoor gazebo, gift shop, and the Culina Muttart Caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 serves several menu items made with locally-sourced ingredients, including herbs and salad greens grown on-site at the greenhouse.\nThe facility, owned and operated by the City of Edmonton, is also a popular site for special events, such as weddings. The conservatory underwent a $6.3 million renovation that was completed in June 2009.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuttart Conservatory website",

          "We visited the Muttart Conservatory in April 2015 with children ages 8, 5 and 5, along with Grandparents. It was absolutely beautiful and I recommend visiting if you get a chance, especially in the winter when it feels warm and tropical during an otherwise cold day outside.",

          "Divided into three glass pyramids (Arid, Temperate and Tropical), the Muttart Conservatory is a landmark in Edmonton and must see for anyone exploring what the wonderful city has to offer. The tour guides and informative and fun and the \u2026",
          "This was such a beautiful place to visit \ud83d\udc93I also enjoyed the service.",
          "Great place, but, Edmontons down fall when it comes to memories of the region. No history. Mill Creek, the brick yard, the Edmonton and Yukon railroad, the incinerator, the river boat, the separation of Edmonton and Strathcona (north v.s. \u2026",
          "This is a great place to see all kinds of various plants! There are 4 different viewing areas to see! It changes throughout the year! Come check it out!",
          "Had a great time. Plan to go just before it starts to get dark so you can experience it in both day and night time (especially if your seeing the moon exhibit for Aug-Sept 2018). At night, each pyramid is beautifully lit.",
          "If they are going to have a wedding party here, which is going to infringe on my ability to view everything, that's fine, but dont charge me full price!",
          "Such a good place to take the kids for a nice afternoon.  Always fun!",
          "A healing experience. So much beauty in one place.\nThe staff were nice too.",
          "Booked for a private event and catering. Food was excellent and being able to be amongst friends for many hours and slowly enjoying each pyramid. I would recommend booking for  a private function if you are able. Staff were great and friendly. So much fun!!",
          "Awesome. Went early and enjoyed a quiet walk through the gardens. No plantings outside yet as it is too early.",
          "A real gem in Edmonton. Beautiful mature plants and seasonal ones. Nice for taking pictures of each other.",
          "The moon feature is really good - not just for the huge moon, but the plants are on theme and well selected too. It was open late 3 nights this week and we took home plant seedlings!\n\nThe \"normal\" parts of the Muttart are worthwhile too, \u2026",
          "Most of the bigger trees and shrubs are dormant right now but it was still beautiful in each of the pyramids.  It was so lovely to see the oranges turning orange!",
          "It is definitely worth visiting, the price was fair and there are many beautiful plants and trees to see in the various pyramids. I would definitely come back the next time I visit Edmonton.",
          "I am a photographer in Edmonton and the Muttart is one of my favorite locations to spend time at. It is so architecturally interesting and you have a great view of downtown from the building. The gardens inside are fantastic with a large variety of plants from many different climates. A must see in Edmonton.",
          "Beautiful and informative! Really enjoyed the guided tours throughout the three pyramids.",
          "This place was not bad at all but as someone for visiting I wouldn't call it a \"tourist attraction\", or at least for me as a 31 y/o adult it's not interesting enough. But it is def a very nicely designed place. Can be a must see for plant lovers and kids/elders.",
          "Great venue for a wedding or other celebration, place with good vibe. Different, for sure from your typical restaurant or hall, but one that people will remember..",
          "Another gem of Edmonton. Although I only have pictures taken with my drone at night, this is a great place to come visit during the day. \nThe kids liked our visit here and have asked to come back again. Little did they know that they were \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful place. Friendly service amenities, flowers, a great place to shake the winter blues",
          "I have visited several botanical gardens across Canada and this one is the most miserable one. It's small, always same with boring and repetitive features. I have visited free of charge gardens that had better variety of plants.\nResponse to the owner: \nI do have recommendations but my service is not free",
          "First time in 20+ years that I have lived in Edmonton...ever visiting this location. Amazing!! Highly recommended!!",
          "It's nice, but maybe more interactive stuff.",
          "Wonderful place to visit. The plants are beautiful and large. We recommend all family's to visit them . Merry Christmas.",
          "Not impressed. Could go in a free greenhouse and have a similar experience. Buildings and garden are old and tatty. Great variety of plants and probably a good spot for wedding photoshoot.",
          "Adult evening -- what an amazing concept! This should be something that is considered in other public attractions so you can enjoy the space with a drink in peace and quiet w/ presentations and tours if you so like. Very much enjoyed the atmosphere and feature pyramid!",
          "Excellent displays, although fairly busy. There are four display areas and each represents a different climate.",
          "Person with plant knowledge was great. The rest of the staff not so great.  Caf\u00e9 server seemed confused and unable to explain what the cafe has to offer.  Gift shop lady ignored me while she had a conversation with a friend. Great place, not so great staff.",
          "So much fun, beautiful and calming. I can't believe I had never been here after living in Edmonton for my whole life. The staff are also very kind and helpful!",
          "Excellent place to visit with family and friends.  One can lose themselves in a different world in this place!  It is an oasis in the downtown Edmonton area.\nI highly recommend.",
          "Very fun. Would recommend to people looking for something easy but fun",
          "Great place. My kids had fun and enjoyed",
          "Great spot to escape the polar vortex winters of -30. Lovely mini 2 hour vacation.",
          "This is a fantastic place for a father-son bonding. I used to take my two boys to visit the pyramids every year when we used to live in Edmonton. Now, I am visiting from Victoria, BC. The place did not loose its touch. Boys loved all four \u2026",
          "The kids described it as really cool and smells nice.",
          "One of my favourite places in the city, year round. Especially awesome in the Winter due to the temperature and greenery. Its a great experience for all ages, for families, for couples, or even solo for a coffee and some scenery."

        "wiki": "Telus World of Science (TWOS) is a broad-based science centre in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, operated by the (non-profit) Edmonton Space & Science Foundation. The centre is located on the southwest corner of Coronation Park in the neighborhood of Woodcroft. It is currently a member of both the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) and the Canadian Association of Science Centres (CASC).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe centre first opened in 1984, as a replacement for the Queen Elizabeth Planetarium, located to the east, that had operated as Edmonton's Planetarium since 1960 but had become limited by its seating capacity of 65. The City of Edmonton selected the Edmonton Space Sciences Centre as the City's flagship project commemorating the Province of Alberta's 75th Anniversary. The original building was designed by architect Douglas J. Cardinal.When first opened, it was called the Edmonton Space Science Centre and then later it was changed to the Edmonton Space and Science Centre. In 2001, after a 14-million dollar expansion of the original building, the name was changed again to the Odyssium. On May 2, 2005, the centre was renamed to the Telus World of Science - Edmonton after a $8.2 million, 20-year partnership was established with Telus. The centre attracts over half a million visitors a year and has Canada's largest planetarium dome theatre (the Zeidler Dome).\nTWOS is currently undergoing another expansion, budgeted at $40 million, that would see the centre triple in size. The expansion includes a new DVT (Digital Visualization Theatre), new galleries, an upgraded restaurant and, through a partnership with the University of Alberta, a research facility that would allow ideas to be tested and modified. The renovations have begun, with the caf\u00e9 under renovation. There is currently no target date available for these renovations.\n\n\n== Exhibits Galleries ==\n\n\n=== Discoveryland ===\nAn interactive gallery that is designed to interest children between the ages to two and eight years. It consists of four main areas: WaterWorks, the Construction Zone, Discovery Den and Potters Corner. Some of the highlights include a giant piano, which you play by walking on the keys, a multi-level water table and a multitude of blocks.\n\n\n=== Environment Gallery ===\nThe Environment Gallery has interactive displays about hydrology, ecology, meteorology (featuring a Science On a Sphere projector), and Alberta's geology.\n\n\n=== Health Gallery ===\nThe Body Fantastic room is an interactive carnival-style exhibition about the anatomy and physiology of the human body. Highlights include a multi-axis trainer and the Gallery of the Gross, which houses specimens of earwax, urine and other substances that the human body produces.\n\n\n=== Robotics Laboratory ===\nThe Lego Mindstorms Centre is a 45-minute guided program in which guests program pre-built robots to perform various tasks and missions. It is only open to the general public during weekends and holidays. During the week it is used by school groups.\n\n\n=== Space Gallery ===\nThe Space Place introduces visitors to astronomy and astronautics. Highlights include an actual moon rock, on long-term loan from NASA, that was collected during the Apollo program, a radio controlled replica of the Mars Pathfinder rover and a computer program that turns your face into an alien.\n\n\n=== Kinetic Hall ===\nThis exhibit space hosts small temporary exhibits that are included with a general admission. Currently, it is used for summer camps, school groups, and for various public and non-public events.\n\n\n=== Science Garage ===\nThe Science Garage is an exhibit where visitors can be more hands-on and explore science face-to-face, with activities as well as learning opportunities such as a vertical climbing wall. There are make-and-take workshops, as well as an array of ever-changing programming offered in this gallery. This gallery also houses a rolling ball machine built by George Rhoads which used to be at West Edmonton Mall.\n\n\n=== Feature Exhibit Gallery ===\nThis 1,500-square-metre (16,000 sq ft) gallery hosts large temporary exhibits that are not included with a general admission. Past exhibits have included Star Wars: Identities, Body Worlds & The Cycle of Life, Harry Potter: The Exhibition, Indiana Jones and the Adventure of Archaeology, and the International Exhibit of Sherlock Holmes, and The Science Behind Pixar.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== IMAX Theatre ===\nA 275-seat theatre showing current educational movies, shot in high resolution IMAX film reel. The Telus World of Science features the original IMAX Theatre in Western Canada. Images are enhanced by a custom designed six-channel, multi-speaker sound system are projected onto a 13m x 19m (4 storey x 6 storey) screen.\nIn early 2016, renovations had been completed in the IMAX theatre, upgrading it to an IMAX Laser 4K Projector system (one of 3 theatres in Canada).Admission to the IMAX theatre is not included with general admission. Recently, the IMAX Theatre began showing Hollywood blockbusters (such as Batman v Superman or Zootopia) within a few months after screening in cinemas. As with the educational films, these are not included in the admission price and can be more expensive than the educational films. The Hollywood films cannot be used in the Science Centre + IMAX combos.\n\n\n=== Margaret Zeidler Star Theatre ===\nThe 250-seat large dome theatre that was formerly used for laser shows and star shows. It was the largest such theater in Canada when the center opened in 1984. In 2008, the Margaret Zeidler Star Theatre changed its projection system and educational content to a full dome immersive video experience. The Telus World of Science Edmonton was the first planetarium and science center in Canada to showcase this new technology for domed theatres. Admission to shows in the Star Theatre is included in general admission.\n\n\n=== Science Stage ===\nThe Syncrude Science Stage features a staff member demonstrating science, typically involving flammable gases, dry ice, or electricity. A child from the audience will often be called upon to assist the demonstrator with an activity. The demonstrations are included with general admission.\n\n\n=== DOW Computer Lab ===\nThis computer lab opened in August 1995 and relocated to its new location in April 2001 beside the Telus Robotics Lab. The DOW Computer Lab has various electronic teaching tools available and a high speed internet connection to each workstation. However, the computer lab can still be rented for special events and is used during the summer months for computer camps.\n\n\n=== Observatory ===\nThere is an observatory outdoors, separate from the main building. It is free of charge, but it opens only when the weather permits, and it closes if the temperature is below \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F). It is equipped with seven telescopes, including a Meade 16\" LX200, a 180 mm (7 in) Starfire refractor, and three solar telescopes all provided by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (Edmonton Centre).\n\n\n=== Purple Pear and Gift Shop ===\nThe science centre has a caf\u00e9 for visitors and for special events such as fundraisers. The caf\u00e9 was undergoing renovations as of early 2016 with an estimated completion by the end of August 2016, though it was delayed until November 2016. The caf\u00e9 is also responsible for providing the concession, which is currently hosted in the main lobby, next to the box office.\nIn November 2016, the cafe re-opened, but under a new name, The Purple Pear and a new focus on fresher, and local ingredients. They were also the first location in Western Canada to use tagged Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.\nThere is also a gift shop in the lobby, featuring a range of educational products, books, gift items, and other knick-knacks.\n\n\n== Programs ==\n\n\n=== Science in Motion ===\nScience in Motion is a feature at Telus World of Science - Edmonton that brings science programs and presentations to schools that are more than 100 km (62 mi) from the centre. The program, taught by certified teachers, uses experiments, demonstrations and hands-on activities to teach science and is designed to meet the learning objectives set out in the Alberta science curriculum.\n\n\n=== TransAlta Science Lab ===\nThe TransAlta Science Lab is a fully equipped laboratory that allows students to participate in science experiments.\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe Museum is affiliated with: ASTC,  CMA,  CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTelus World of Science\nTelus Spark, Calgary\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of the Telus World of Science, Edmonton\nTelus World Of Science",

          "It\u2019s okay. Definitely not a cheap day out. The food in the restaurant looked good, but a bit pricey. The hands on areas are good, but being there when there are schools present is not ideal as there are way too many kids with limited supervision. I\u2019ve been twice in the past",
          "We attended a light show here and had a fabulous time. It was clean and fully accessible. Would definitely attend many more events here.",
          "I haven\u2019t been there since I was a kid and went with some friends from out of town. It kept the adults and all the kids(3-12) all engaged and smiling. But the Marvel exhibit was well worth it.",

          "I was very impressed with the facility. The staff were amazing and informed. They shared the information in a way that everyone was glued to their every word. I recommend this as a place to spend a day.",
          "Spent the afternoon here, was fun but mostly for kids, the best part was the Northern lights show in the dome. Definately need more hand sanitizer stations as kids were touching everything as they do but even so exhibits could have been cleaner.",
          "We probably should invest in an annual pass, as it is always exciting to watch the new shows and walk through the new exhibits. There is something for everyone, no matter how old or young you are.",
          "Great time for the kids - and the adults ! Went last week with the kids and they really had fun. The inside out animals was interesting and surprisingly the kids were not scared. Saw the super dogs movie at IMAX and everyone enjoyed it. Curious City was ok as the kids got to",
          "We visited this Science Museum during Spring Break 2019 and the place was heaving with families. What a wonderful place for children to learn about their world! There are so many wonderful exhibits and hands-on activities that it keeps both children and parents busy trying out",
          "We have been annual members for years. There is always something for all ages. I love the fact that they are constantly changing the imax films and looking for ways to improve.",
          "Very educational. A definite must see. Plenty has been fixed up and it\u2019s still kept pretty clean. Great place to spend a day.",
          "Interesting look at Cuba, mostly Havana, from an architectural view point. An architect dedicated to the restoration of Cuba's once illustrious past building by building. Some history, some local colour. Very interesting.",
          "I saw a move at the iMax it was great, large screen, the show was great. It kept me interested the entire time.",
          "This is a popular place for kids from 3 to 70+ The interactive elements are a hit with the kids, as are the \"parties\" that include tours and pizza. The gift shop is crammed with fun things too and the picnic styled restaurant offers a welcome respite after your visit. The IMAX",
          "A very informative IMAX show on the Galapagos Islands. It is about the history of the formation of the Islands and how it became a unique sub culture in evolution of animals. The photgraphy was fantastic",
          "Attended with the kids. Parking was brutal, admission was very pricey, especially for the quality of exhibits inside. Cheap, tacky facts like 'you burn 1.5 calories while standing in line'. ..... really? Expected to be really wow'd but this place falls really short of other",
          "Went to the World of Science for the animal bodies exhibit. It was pretty good and the people working were very educated on the exhibit. We decided to tour around after and we found a couple of the other exhibits not overly exciting and one wasn\u2019t even running as most of it was",
          "I visited here while in Edmonton on business. Though I did find that most of the exhibits are geared towards younger children there are still some areas that adults will find interesting. The Animal Body Works exhibit was awesome and was the highlight of my visit. There were a",
          "We went yesterday afternoon spending just under 3 hours. watched the Cuba which was ok was expecting more to it. The animal works exhibit was ok. it was a great way to spend a cold day.",

          "Lots of fun for the whole family, lots of hands on activities, experiments to watch and participate in. there are special exhibitions that come, like the Harry potter, Animals inside and many many more, also the IMax theater always playing the best science and nature films, and",
          "Great place to spend a few hours. This time was just for the documentary. Friendly and helpful staff!",
          "Amazing exhibit! From the tiniest of animals to the largest. It was truly amazing to see every part of the animals. From tendons, muscle tissue to their skeleton. I would highly suggest visiting this exhibit. There are other fun exhibits to see while you\u2019re there. This venue is",
          "Makes me feel like a kid again! So much to do, and they have awesome shows and events here! Love going and exploring all the cool stuff they have. The detective one is by far my favourite!",
          "We came here primarily to see \"Pandas\" in IMAX, but I would go back someday to look at the exhibits and so forth. The staff that we encountered during and before the movie were very helpful and we really enjoyed the film. Loved the gift shop as well and was able to get a panda",
          "So much to see so little time. The staff is friendly and the exhibits are superb. I am a repeat customer and go whenever I can. I love that the exhibits are always interesting and very well done.",

          "Several hours of enjoyment exploring science. Great laser show with Christmas music. Lots of informative exhibits.",
          "This was very educational for small children but not that interesting for adults without children. Very nice staff and well organized",
          "This is such a great place to go explore. So many hands on activities. And the new theatre with the Aurora Borealis show is spectacular. The kids get to lay down on huge bean bags and enjoy the views. Get to the theatre a bit early so they get a spot for sure, otherwise it fills",
          "located in North West- Central part of Edmonton. Free parking on site. Entry fee excluding iMax is about $14/ adult and a bit less than that for kids. The two story building has exhibits on both floors and the centre as a whole is focused on children. the 2nd floor runs a show",
          "What a great place to take a family or go to open your eyes to amazing things. Great exhibits and helpful staff. Great for learning about all kinds of things.",
          "We were actually shocked at the price of the entire thing. It was 104 dollars to gain entry and see 2 movies. The movies were great. That was a 52 dollar part of the day. And that money was well spent. The rest of the place was a real let down. The amount of money that is",
          "The TELUS science center in Edmonton is a very educational and interesting place to go. I went to see the Panda documentary they had playing. While I waited for my showtime I explored and this venue is very well done and very educational. They had a dinosaur exhibit that was",

          "This place is a must see. The I max Theater to lying in the seats while star gazing. Lots to learn and see. Not to much walking as every pavilion is well presented and timed well I put my son in the summer camp. I\u2019m not to sure what I thought of it. Was it worth the money. I",
          "We arrived as a group of 5 adults having not heard much about the place other than that it was one of the more popular attractions in the city. We asked at the desk if it would be worth it as a group without kids and we\u2019re assured we would all enjoy it. The highlights did",
          "We were looking up things to do in Edmonton and came across this. The IMAX was great. We went to the Great Barrier Reef and it was very educational. We also went to the Auroa presentation in the planirarian it was really interesting and good information. The feature exhibit",
          "We saw the dinosaurs on the side of the buses and that was all the invitation we needed. After help getting there by a most friendly bus driver we were very impressed with the building from the outside. Not to mention the extremely large and loud long necked (a plant eater we",
          "It's a good place to go with your family. My family went there for a couple of IMAX movies. Great place to have kids B'day parties.",
          "Went to the Space Science Centre with a friend and her 4 year old grandson. We were all entertained, and challenged by hands on displays. We viewed the Star Theatre presentation on the stars. We were surprised how fast the time passed, all the information we learned, and the",
          "Firstly, we were taken aback by the cost of our visit - for 2 seniors and a 3 yr old the cost was $62.85! Our grandson is into dinosaurs and so that was the focus of our visit. But before you can enter the dinosaur exhibit, one must navigate through the gift shop. NOT impressed!",
          "The experience is exceptionally good. Well laid out with lots of interactive opportunities. A great place to spend half a day",
          "Just love the programs and the browsing inside. We try to make it a regular visit as the venues change.",
          "I can tell you the money spent on entrance fees is well the value for a days outing. There is so many things to do and learn. We took our 5 year old daughter and it happened to be the dinosaur exhibit at the time. Well now she is so into dinosaurs we had to make a special trip",
          "This is a very intresting place for ypung and old..Many different things to see and learn about..there are new exhibits every few months..There is a place area for young children",
          "Great selection of exhibits. Easy to spend an entire day here with something for kids of all ages (parents will enjoy it too!) the planetarium is fantastic, presenter was great and a few different shows played throughout the day which was nice. The space exhibit is small but",
          "We spent the day here today. It was quiet and there were no crowds since it was mid week and kids were in school. There was something fun for everyone here! The live science show was hands-on and fun. The exhibits were all interesting and interactive. We enjoyed the feature",
          "We took our kids here for the long weekend. I was absolutely tickled pink at the variety of activities and displays here. Every room has some kind of engaging activity for all ages of kids and adults. This is a \"must see\" destination for all families!",
          "My wife and I go to visit the new attractions every couple of years This is a very interesting attraction for all ages and the staff are very friendly and helpful We took in the sights and joined a tour. We watched a very enjoyable young lady teach a class about static",
          "Pandas show was well done! Love seeing the IMAX big screen. Liked the assigned seating - new to me. Science Centre a favorite stop",
          "This was so fun! Lots to do for school aged crowd. Cafeteria had lots of reasonably priced and healthy food options, as well as fresh grilled options rather than fried. Exhibitions were interactive, and volunteers/staff all over in case you have questions. Really enjoyed the",
          "We went to the angry birds exhibit while it was there, the Harry Potter exhibit and many others! Always a good time. The 3D movies are so cool too.",
          "Great for a family visit! Enjoy a walk around Coronation Park, check out the telescopes at night, catch an IMAX show and the exhibits!",
          "Amazing exhibits that keep all ages entertained. The Dinosaur exhibit is fascinated by the sounds and actions playing and the info displays also. Highly recommended: Dinosaurs unearthed Doown To The Bone Zeidler Dome Space Gallery Terry Fox Exhibition What an amazing",
          "This is the third science centre we have visited and it is by far the best one we\u2019ve seen yet. We managed to spend a whole day walking around and could have stayed a little longer. Even had my teenagers smiling.",
          "So many places throughout the exhibits that keep all ages entertained. We took our 2 1/2 year grandson to see the Dinosaur exhibit that the had in July of 2018 and he was fascinated by the sounds and actions of the dinosaurs of the exhibit, but we also noticed how the older kids",
          "Enjoyed this attraction while visiting Edmonton on a rainy day. Caters well to families with small children, with areas of interest to all ages. The dinosaur exhibit was well done. However, not on the same scale as the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller. Nor did it attempt to be.",
          "Was visiting Edmonton for a wedding and had some spare time so we went to the Science museum. It did not disappoint, the Zeidler Dome was amazing and had just reopened after being renovated.",
          "We had 4 adults and 1 child in our group and the admission price came to $118. That is a lot of money to see a dinosaur exhibit and have the child run around in a play room. We also had lunch in the cafeteria, needless to say that was a very expensive day. Telus of science was",
          "We are visiting Edmonton for the weekend and decided to check out the museum last minute as the weather wasn't cooperating with our other plans. We were really impressed with the museum. Lots of different areas and some neat, interactive displays. It was quite busy the day we",
          "We recently visited Telus world if Science to check out their Dinosaur exhibit. It was amazing! The motorized dinosaurs blew the kids away. They also have an amazing interactive area for kids. Including a water table and a tree house building area. We had a really great",
          "I guess I was blessed to grow up with the Ontario Science Centre because this place was not up to the same level. But even Science Nord in Sudbury was excellent too, so maybe this place needs to upgrade and do better. This place is geared toward kids obviously, but it was just",
          "We went to view the IMAX 3D presentation on Pandas - a very fascinating movie and not very long. We've been to other IMAX shows here before and have never been disappointed. The theatre is comfortable and staff are helpful and professional. Outside of the IMAX, there are",
          "Great facility. Went to the theatre. Recommend that u sit high up for 3D. Great way for the family to spend a rainy summer afternoon.",
          "So my six and four year old were really excited to go to the dinosaur exhibit currently there. My wife and I went sure how much longer we\u2019d get out of them. We ended up being there for over six and a half hours and my kids were reluctant to leave! They particularly enjoyed the",
          "We were looking for something to do on a colder day in Edmonton so we decided to check out the Science Center. It is expensive like a previous reviewer mention especially since 2 of the attractions are closed until August 1st due to upgrades. You are told when you walk up to the",
          "They had some interesting options but they are on the pricey side. We had Dino fingers that were slightly over cooked. I noticed that some children's portions were quite large and could be shared between two children. Some of the sandwiches were not typical ones that you would",
          "A single adult admission for this place is $26.95 + GST as I write this and there is no way it is worth that much. Save your money and take the family to a movie (maybe an IMAX show at TWOS) but the admission price is way too high!",
          "Took three grandkids 14, 4 and 6 to IMAX. With the membership the costs was about $15.00 for the five of us. The intro was the pandas which is the next show but then entertained with the Great Barrier Reef which with 3-D was fabulous. Certainly one of the best attraction in",
          "Although the place on first appearances is geared mainly for children. Kids of all ages (that includes adults too) will enjoy this place. It can get very busy. So go early.",
          "Great place to go for an interesting experience and a chance to learn something new. Exhibits change frequently so check and see what\u2019s going on before going.",
          "We were disappointed to discover that we had to pay $5/person on top of our Calgary science center membership. I had called ahead of time and was not told this when I inquired. On the plus side, parking is free. The exhibits are small and there is currently construction going on",
          "Everyone in the city should pay a visit to this science center once to experience all the fun and creative ways they showcase the world of science. The IMAX theater is also insane!",
          "Whether you're going to watch an IMAX film, learn about the universe or explore a new attraction, the Telus World Of Science is always a fun and interesting place to visit; young or old.",
          "I have been researching this place ever since I heard that they will be having a dinosaur exhibit. I have a 6 year old son who is obsessed with dinosaur. We went there 3rd day of the exhibit and bought a membership, it was $199.99 for a family membership and a one day ticket",
          "We came here frequently when the kids were growing up. While we tried to visit a couple of times since, we were always trying on a weekend which meant there was no parking and the place was mobbed. We went on a weekday, early in the morning recently and were able to make a day",
          "We found this place very educational. At first we were a bit skeptical about coming here as we've been to hundreds of science centre's probably through our travels. After a while, some science centre's seem copy and paste of other ones. This one; however, was great! We learned a",
          "Although the price of admission may seem high ($60+ for family of 3 people), it is absolutely worth every penny. There were exciting live science shows every hour; my 4 year old daughter sat through 3 of them because the \"scientist\" on-stage was so engaging. Great job! The",
          "We are Telus Spark (Calgary) members so we get to go here for free. From the reviews online I was expecting something amazing...we were pretty let down when we came here. Even the kids were bored since alot of the exhibits are not hands on like Calgary. And there is so much dust",
          "Been going here for over 15 years and love it. It\u2019s great for kids and adults alike, you always learn something new. The movies are great for grandparents, too.",
          "Very nice interior and exterior. Love their exhibits. Imax incredible. But removing one star because the parking area is too small. But all in all it is great facility you will be walking out happy for sure.",
          "Great place to visit with family and friends. The science displays, experiments and IMAX are fun and educational at the same time. Enjoy.",
          "This is a great Imax theater. I find it is always a fun place to visit for people of all ages. They always seem to have interesting exhibits",
          "Great diversity; family friendy, fun learning experience. IMAX, science, pop culture, planetarium -TWOSE has it all. A gem in Edmonton's crown.",
          "Centrally located near Ross Sheppard high school off of 142 street is an amazing science center. I look my grandson who is almost 3 years old and we had a blast! There is free parking which makes up a little for the pricey entrance fee. There are numerous displays and",

          "Our family thoroughly enjoyed the Science Center. We also loved the live demos and IMAX show. It was a great way to spend the day with family while having fun and learning new things.",
          "We recently visited the Telus World of Science as part of a school field trip and had a great time! We were greeted by staff and shown where to place our items. They definitely need more coat hangers for school groups. If you are going with a class I would recommend a backpack",
          "Excellent place to take kids. My son loves the kids area and there is so much for him to do. Lots of different exhibits to explore",
          "I bought my first membership to the Telus World of Science and am now on the email list - if you haven't been or think that it is just for families and kids - think again and check it out. There are great events at IMAX, travelling shows and regular events. My husband and I are",
          "We hadn\u2019t been to the space and science centre for many years. We brought our 6 and 8 year old grandkids for the first time. They loved it! Our 8 year old was disappointed the space section was closed down but loved the rest of it. The Terry Fox exhibit was a highlight. It is",
          "We are so fortunate to have this available for our families to enjoy! There are continual upgrades with the Aurora project being started and I can\u2019t wait to see it when it is all done. Our family spent Good Friday here and enjoyed every min! All of the exhibits to explore were",
          "Let me start by saying I love science centers, and this was one of the best I've been to. The demonstrations are fun for the whole family and the people doing them were very engaging. Standing exhibits we're well laid out and interesting for all ages. I was a little sketched out",
          "Perfect size with all that you need! The Edmonton science centre has free parking and is very accessible. You can bring your own lunch or get something at their coffee shop. There is a nice gift shop. All of the exhibitions were interesting, relevant and interactive. Would be",
          "Telus is the best science center in the canada Have 3 section and have a section for kids under 5 It is very intrested place",
          "Was a bit pricey but the kids did stay nearly 3.5 hours so not the worst money I've spent. Second visit had the pop culture exhibit instead of the dinosaurs but I actually felt this was an improvement.",
          "Always a fun place to go for the day. I wish that all featured exhibits are as in depth as others. For example Indiana Jones or the Star Wars exhibits are amazing. Full of information and things to look at at every corner. As the latest exhibits, Pixar or Popnology there is alot",
          "Love the place I\u2019m always looking for places to take my children so at least they\u2019re learning something while they\u2019re out",
          "I have enjoyed the numerous exhibits they have had come to the science centre although I do believe the other areas need a bit of an update they have great travelling exhibits",
          "Was in town and noticed the dark matters 18+ event. Attended the event with my partner. Check in was easy and the box office printed our tickets for us. Reasonably priced, plenty to do (strugglers to see it all), and fun!! Would return to see other events they are holding",

          "Absolutely wonderful watching Bollywood movie here, wasn\u2019t even aware they played Bollywood movies here, accidentally stumbled upon it and what a treat it was! Thank you",
          "The Science gift shop is cool with all of the throwback vintage toys for the new generation. We really enjoy watching movies here with the huge screen and excellent sound. We love how it isn't crowded either when we have been. They have a concession as well with decent popcorn",
          "We loved the TWOS. The exhibits are well laid out and spacious. The subject matter interesting and the amount of hands on learning is fantastic. We also took in the IMAX film which was about the Amazon and it's contribution to the theory of evolution. Beautiful film but volume",
          "With the membership you can get into similar places around the continent. The staff seems excited and welcoming. They change it often enough that when you return there are new things to try. They seem to make liquid nitrogen ice cream every day, not sure that they do but most",
          "We decided to take in the Telus World of Science on Family Day. We were a little concerned because the parking lot was very full but there was so much to see and do for everyone and it didn't feel overly crowded. The kids loved the science presentation that started just as we",

          "We took our 15, 9 and 3-year old and while there was lots to do for everyone, this place needs to hurry up with their stated renovation plans! Many of the displays in the Body exhibit were broken or didn\u2019t work, and that area used to be so cool! Also, some areas were closed",
          "We took our family. Interesting place. The teenagers lost interest soon. I wouldn't do it again unless a real interesting exhibit came. Not a great bang for the buck.",
          "It is a very exspensive place for what is offered. The exhibits are old and uninteresting. The soap dispensers in the bathrooms don't work. Horrible for a place like this where you have to touch everything to experience the exhibit. Germ factory!!! Save your $100 and go to the",
          "It wasn't worth what we paid to get in, but it was interesting. I'd only go again if I had a discount.",
          "There might be some interesting props here for some people. Some of it was closed when we attended and only learned this after the price of admission, like the (planetarium). Telus World of Science entry is priced for the wealthy in my opinion. I spent more than a weeks",
          "The Telus World Science Center is a boon for families and adults! If you have a curious mind, like to spend time with your family of all ages, discovering, laughing, and learning about various aspects of science...then it is a must. This facility will also have special events",

          "My family visited this past week (3 adults 2 children) during -27 temperatures as something fun to do indoors away from the cold. Unfortunately the main attraction (Observatory) was closed during the holidays and apparently not open unless it's warmer than -10 degrees Celsius.",
          "Lots of fun, interactive things to see. The Pixar exhibit was very interesting, more geared towards older kids and adults. Tones of great info. We were sad to see that the space exhibit was closed however.",
          "We have been to the World of Science centre a few times. My grandson was challenged by the science and enjoyed himself immensely. It was so nice just to wonder around and try the different experiments and such. This is a great family outing.",
          "our office attended the TELUS World of Science for our Children's Christmas Party. It is a great venue because of the difference in ages. This was geared for all ages and was especially great for interacting with parents at the different stations. The food on the other hand",

          "Wow!! This place was incredible! My husband, daughter and I visited the Space and Science Centre November 16th and we had so much fun interacting and learning new things. Usually when we come to Edmonton we just go to West Ed Mall, but this time we wanted to try something",

          "I had not went to the Telus World of Science for possibly a decade. I went this week to see the Island of Lemurs and wow! I had a smile on my face the entire time. It was 3d and my experience in the movie theatre for 3d was iffy. I noticed for the first few mins it was neat",
          "We were excited for Dark Matters which landed on a Thursday night, there was quite a turn out. Pros: - Easily accessible - Liquor and Entertainment - 18+ (no screaming kids) - Friendly - Decorative Cons: - Not enough adult experiments - Not adult enough - Small - Not much",
          "My boyfriend and I came here on a date in the afternoon near closing time which ended up being perfect as there wasn't many children running around. We had a blast! Such a great learning center for all ages. There is so much to do and see! The angry bird exhibit was being",
          "I went there long time ago and went in there before I don't remember what year it was Nice to see it again soon",
          "If you want some place to go that your children will truly enjoy, and learn at, this is the place. My family loves the events, and the interaction then Telus is the place to bring them.",
          "We have a grandchildren annual pass and travel across town often to visit--and receive discounts for friends and for food and gifts. The Pixar exhibit requires several visits--we bought the return pass for unlimited and unscheduled visits. The grandchildren love to go.",
          "We bought the annual family pass so we could return several times a year. They change the feature exhibits and also the IMAX film offering. The world of Science is very interactive so our grandkids can run loose and they can do all the experiments and testing they like.",
          "So I didn\u2019t have to pay for the trip but if I did I think it wouldn\u2019t be worth it at all. Place is very overrated in my eyes. For what you pay and what you get out of it I don\u2019t think it is worth it. The IMAX movie was not bad though.",
          "We went especially for the Pixar exhibit. It was a great experience. I have a little one, even though he probably didn't know what it was, he enjoyed all the interactive stuff that was in the exhibit.",
          "The best IMAX theatre in the city! Cheap concession & cheap admission to movies that are a Lil bit older in release! Great night's to use their telescope as well.",
          "In terms of it being a science centre, it has science things. Whether or not kids learn from it, that's up to their brains to decide. It does have a really good cafeteria though with a good selection of healthy and unhealthy food choices.",
          "We come here often, usually watching online for interesting things to bring the kids to see. It's a great layout, and generally very educational. As long as we're living in the area, it'll be on our to-do list.",
          "This is really a hands on science centre. We went to see the Pixar exhibit and all people in our party were over 30. Even in that area there was lots to touch and try, science garage more for younger kids and the anatomy one was full of great facts and things to try. Overall we",
          "It seemed pretty small compared to the Toronto Science Centre. There were a few exhibits. We did love the Science of Pixar and spent most of the visit there. They seem to be doing a lot of construction. Not a lot of hands on things for the kids.",
          "From IMAX to learning experiences, this has it all!! We had a lot of fun checking in all the cool rooms, themes, ect.",
          "Took some out of town visitors to the Telus World of Science because they wanted to see the Pixar exhibit. Very child friendly, lots to do and a cafe. Planetarium, Imax and a toddler and child play area. There was a lot to see and lots to learn. Ample Parking, stairs and",
          "We were in Edmonton for a few days and thought we should check it out. We came here not really knowing what to expect. Outside had lots of parking available, was clean and well landscaped. When we first went inside we were somewhat confused on where to go but the staff were",
          "Telus world of science is a must visit. great for the kids with lots to do. Learning and games and great for the parents.",
          "kids love science shows. they always have something to enjoy. annual pass is a good idea especially that it allows access to other science centers.",
          "What an awesome place for Kids!! so much to do, so much to see, hands on stuff! This is a must for parents to take the children to! From Toddlers to 8-10 , all will enjoy.",
          "A great place to go with interactive exhibits. Fun for kids and even your inner child. A bit on the pricey end, but definitely worth it.",
          "I love he TELUS Word of science one of my favourite places for a nice educational yet fun filled day with the family. We try to go a few times a year. The Exhibits are always nice. IMAX is awesome as well. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly as well",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. The Pixar exhibit and the mystery of china IMAX. We were lost in the exhibits for hours",
          "Want a great way to spend a few hours with family? This is it. Fun and educational and great for all ages. Also, you can't beat an IMAX flick!",
          "The main exhibit during my visit was Pixar. I appreciate that they taper entrances so that it's not too crowded in the exhibit room. However, they kept adding people to the into video so there were no seats, it was hard to see, and there were extra people at my entrance time.",
          "It' a great place for some family fun. The science workshops are great and let the kids get in on the action. Our only disappointment was that not everything worked. I know it's hard to keep up with everything, but it would be nice if that were so.",
          "Well we were super excited about the Pixar display seen as we are going to Disneyland at the end of the month however this one greatly disappointed nothing kept our young ones attention we had more fun actually going through the science center than the special area. Maybe look",
          "It's a cool place to see but from my point of view it's bit expensive! other than that this is really good place to visit in Edmonton. Good place for kids, teen and families.",
          "We had a great time at the Telus World Of Science . In my opinion a bit pricey . We enjoyed Horizon the IMAX movie . Great for younger kids .",
          "Overall the science center is pretty good. We went there for the Pixar Animation Display. It was pretty cool, but I would not recommend it for kids under 10. Most of it was well beyond my sons understanding, and he's 7. The rest of the science center is quite old and could use",
          "This place was amazing to explore and to bring along 2 kids. We were lucky enough to catch the Pixar exhibit, which was very informative and incredible to see! Lots of stations to learn from and try. The rest of the centre is great too, I would leave lots of time for it! Great",
          "We went to see the Science behind Pixar at Telus World, Edmonton.. Amusing learning experience for us. We learn how Pixar computer scientist and Artists combine their knowledge to make films. There are 30 to 40 stations where you interact with a set of instruments and learn",
          "Went with grandchildren in April to see special exhibit- Angry Birds- exhibit was good but could have been much better- was very expensive to get in to it- we actually enjoyed the regular exhibits more than the special exhibit we went to see. The Telus World of Science is very",
          "This place is always an amazing time! So much to do with kids or friends or as a couple! They also have special adult only date nights. There is an IMAX theater (biggest one in Edmonton), and many exhibits and hands on activities throughout the building. There is a special",
          "I took my family here every time they come up and visit, awesome place. They support the troops, show your id and you can get in for free. At Xmas they have a great laser show. Just a really fun place!",
          "My kids and I are enjoying it visit after the other And absolute fun for whole family, I would recommend that if you live in Edmonton, get an annual pass and follow up with exhibitions and events",
          "With a hot humid day our family decided to hit up this museum. We spent a couple hours there. Including the Pixar exhibit and a African IMAX picture. Nice an cool inside. And the kids loved it. Food is a little pricey. No refills on the fountain drinks which is a little",
          "Always a different exhibit and great place to meet people and have fun. I remember going here as a kid and I still get giddy.",
          "we were at Telus world to see a dino exhibit it was great 10 out of 10. The place is ever changing they also have Imax movies you just have to google what is new and see if it is to your interests. The restauraunt will do in a pinch but if you can wait I would.there is also a",
          "Spend time with my sister, grand niece and niece. Exploring the different galleries, the young one really enjoyed the airplane in Discoveryland. Science experiments a HUGE hit especially the ice cream demo. Spent the day and had great fun.",
          "My three kids and I went to the Telus World of Science. It's a neat place, but I would say meant for older children (6+). I had a 3, 4 and 5 yo and the younger ones had difficulty reaching a lot of the exhibits to interact with, not to mention, didn't understand most of them.",
          "The Telus World of Science has fun for everyone in the family. All ages will experience funny or enlightening elements through exploring. We have been to numerous themes from Body World, Angry Birds, Harry Potter and Star Wars. The boys always enjoy and we always have fun too!",
          "The TWOS is perfect for kids of all ages, from toddlers and preschoolers who can enjoy the little play areas to older kids who can really get into the more in-depth science stuff. The travelling exhibits they have are fantastic, we have been to the ones on Rubik's Cube, Harry",
          "From the displays to the Star Theatre to the Imax theatre, Telus World of Science is a wonderful experience for young and old.",
          "The exhibits were great. It wasnt to busy so easy to check out everything and take our time. Thr kids loved the discoery kid zone.",
          "My family and I are members here so we do go quite often. Most recently we were there for The Science Behind Pixar! It was amazing. A very interactive experience for all ages. If you are in the area I highly recommend!",
          "good layout, kid friendly, varied theme presentations through year round. Science orientated in a family user way. Nice facility has a planetarium also.",
          "We held a two day retreat to get some fresh ideas on the table. The meeting space was comfortable and just the right size for our group of 10, although the table was an odd shape. It might have been easier for discussion is it was oval. Having a team activity held by two Telus",
          "TELUS World of Science good for kids, can get lot of information. I like Imax where some one can watch 3D movie. Staff is good.",
          "Our first time to visit this place and we were not that impressed. It is pricey paid $71 for 2 adults and 2 kids (age 4 & 5) my 2 yr old son is free tho. It is spacious but for a big city like edmonton there is nothing much compare to regina which is more cheaper and much more",
          "I had received a gift certificate for Christmas and I really wanted to see a couple of Imax movies. That part of the visit was great. We saw Wild Africa and Extreme Weather. Enjoyed both very much. We decided that we wanted to look around at the exhibits as that is something",
          "There is plenty to see between the shows and the galleries. The angry bird exhibit was awesome too. The cafeteria food is average but you can bring something with you.",
          "This was a great experience for me and my husband! Even though there were lots of kids there, the staff was friendly and very helpful.",
          "One of the best science centers, I have been to. I loved all the little things for young kids. I would highly recommend an annual pass if you live close.",
          "Am glad to visit this beautiful museum with my children, they dived into it and loved it, An entrance fee is required here and we paid 72 Canadian dollars (Without IMAX Viewing) for 2 adults and 2 children for the visit. The receptionists/Volunteers are one of the greatest",
          "I was impressed by the activities and good enjoyable application of science concepts. We saw things related to space. My kids programmed a robot to move with colors and music. We jumped, saw 3D printing, built things, learnt about body parts..etc. I would totally recommend it",
          "We went to check out the angry birds exhibit and we found that it was very dirty and not very well maintained. There was a lot of thing broken. We spend about 20 mins in the exhibit and as we were leaving we were asked if we wanted to purchase a picture that was taken in front",
          "Great place to learn while having a great time. A lot of hands-on things to do and also you can enjoy IMAX shows on different subjects!",
          "I wish one paid a single price and that included visiting everything. Something like \"you can visit a, b, and c for free\", \"a, b. c, d, e, and f\" for $10, etc.",
          "Whoever they have a new show in town I try to get out and see it. They usually have quite a few different ones each year. The facility is always clean and staff is friendly. It's affordable to visit solo or with a group. The IMAX has some great shows, I plan to go again many",
          "We took our 5 year old daughter to the museum where we found that only few activities suits her; the price is expensive given the learning experience we expected; the place suits older children, teenagers and adults..",
          "You cant go wrong with Telus world of science. Its fun and interactive for young children and up. They always have something new each season so it never gets old",
          "It's really big but it was overpriced for what you get. The only cool thing about it was the space theatre",
          "My boyfriend and I went here for an IMAX movie they always have a wide variety of movies to watch and it isn't too expensive. They always are running a variety of different attractions that are good for kids, adults and families. Always a good learning experience and fun too!",
          "Lots to do and learn there.I went with my 4 and 2 years old. They had fun. But I think older kid would enjoy more.\ud83d\ude09 But still a nice place for a visit.",
          "We went here on a Sunday afternoon before an event that evening. The Planitarium show was okay. I thought the show was a little Un Scientific as it Had space ships that were making Noise in the Vacume of Space\ud83d\ude06 Plan on 2-3 hours to see everything. Also the Bathroom was",
          "The best (and only) place to get kids hooked on Science in Edmonton. Various exhibitions, all of them very interactive, include one temporary exhibition, one on the human body, a DIY science garage, an exhibition on the Earth system, one on space, one gallery for toddlers, a",
          "We were a group of 25 sleeping under the stars!! The girls experienced some amazing experiments and got to play in the angry birds exhibit. The staff were amazing!!! Very knowledgeable, patient and kind with children.",
          "We took our three grandchildren there for a day visit and they were entertained the whole time. Like all family attractions its not a cheap day out I'm afraid - especially if you eat in their cafe! I'd recommend you bring a picnic.",
          "I came here for an evening Conference/Mixer. There is a room on the secco door level that is rented out for other groups. The space is pretty big with a projector and sound system. It sat 100 people easily. There is always room for more but the event was smaller. Alcohol is",
          "Go early to take it all in! 2 adults cost $58.70 after taxes, our kids are under 2, so not sure of cost for kiddos. Also it's difficult to find admission process online. There is a ton of stuff to take in and we only had time for a half day and didn't get through all of it.",
          "A neat place to visit, but not all that affordable for the average family. Food court was recently redone, and the set up is poor! Over crowded, and not amenable to a good traffic flow. The IMAX is great, but there is usuallt not a lot of variety, and the show times are pretty",
          "We are annual pass holders (highly recommend it if you plan to go more than a few times a year!) and we go here every few weekends with our young kids. There's a lot for them to do and explore, and they especially love the kids' discovery area (for under 8 year olds). Some of",
          "The Telus world of science is always a great stop in Edmonton. There is always a new exhibition here and some great presentations that are always meant to be fun and informative. I would recommend Telus world of science to any age or group. Great place for a date too (if your",
          "Lots of things here for children to see. I went without children and didnt have time to go through the whole exhibit. Did not like getting charged for a day pass when stopping in an hour before closing but I guess thats business and not their fault. Lots of interactive exhibits",
          "I have been many times. With little kids, adults as well as persons with disabilities and every one of them enjoyed it. The imax was really good. The 3d though if you're prone to motion sickness you may wanna skip it. The star room is cool but wasn't entertaining enough and too",
          "There was really something for everyone and I liked that they had little \"Science Shows\" on the hour. Helps breaks things up. I liked the variety of activities..some maybe not so much...For some reason I can't say I was really WOWED! Would I go again, probably not. Once you've",
          "Compared to Telus Vancouver it wasn't as interesting.Some of the interactives did not work and the Imax films were not as interesting as Omnimax in Vancouver..",
          "Go to the Imax theater, play with the interactive machines, take a walk through wild life exhibits or study the skies. Everything for all 'explorers' is there for your enjoyment. To be sure of your complete enjoyment, inquire beforehand as to what is showing on IMax, or what is",
          "We had a pleasant experience while visiting here. The staff are very pleasant and knowledgeable. There are interactive exercises for all ages and the Imax is great. Superb for a family outing.",
          "A great learning experience through interactive galleries for adults and children .i visited with daughter and two small grandchildren who had a marvellous time exploring and discovering the wonders of the scientific displays. Parents and adults are accommodated to enjoy",
          "Wonderful balance of 3D science and nature types of feature films (eg-Lemurs of Madagascar, Antarctica, etc.). 3D theatre viewing is great. The Telus World of Science also has an observatory where the starts and planets can be viewed by telescope, and has many science exhibits",
          "We visited the science center on a Saturday. Go early as it got busy about 2 hours after it opened. Our son got cut on plastic netting on the zipline in the angry birds attraction. We let an employee know at the entrance and he said yeah we know about it but a guy from seattle",
          "The special travelling exhibits seem like a pricey add-on to the regular admission, but they are worth it. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Sherlock Holmes...were all fantastic and worth the admission. Angry Birds was not as great - geared to a much younger crowd and the science/physics",
          "When we arrived there were several field trips in progress, but they cleared out and it became much quieter. The displays were clearly geared toward a younger audience. But we thoroughly enjoyed the imax theatre and the observatory",
          "We visited TELUS World of Science as two adult couples, and had a good afternoon. There are many exhibits and hands on activities. Despite being adults, we found many of the exhibits interesting and insightful. We were very pleased to see that there are certainly activities",
          "I love the rotating special events that the Telus World of Science has. It's a great place to take families and school groups. The IMAX theater always has a selection of interesting shows to view. The gift shop is fun, the cafeteria style eating area has basic foods if you need",
          "This was our second time here as a family. Lots todo, see, experience. We did an IMAX and a show in the star theater as well as watched a science experment. Kids loved it!! We spent all day there. Food in Cafeteria is very good and reasonably priced. Highy recommend.",
          "A friend, our three year olds and myself spend a the afternoon and they both fell asleep in the car on the way home! The science center offers a lot of fun for the young and open minds, although we did not do the major exibit due to it being really crowded and the teller",
          "We went to see the China production and lucked out as there was a presentation about ice formations in the amphitheater....fabulous speaker and great visuals. Great place for families and experiential learning for kids.",
          "Took the family for the Angry Birds exhibit and they found it boring (ages 5-14). They checked it out and lasted about 20 minutes before wanting to move on to the rest of the exhibits which they spent significantly more time in. As a parent, I was disappointed in the Angry",
          "This centre did not let us down! We have gone several times through the years and everytime we go our kids loved it - from the time they were in the range of 10 years to older teens the last time. We always have fun and take infomation away.",
          "This place had great exhibits, friendly staff, and even a nice food court. The newer exhibits about Canadian research are really cool but they are kind of hidden away upstairs.",
          "This is a very cool museum for young kids- it's not too big that you don't get to see everything and it's very informative. I was impressed with this young lady that my son asked a question of - she didn't know the answer off the top of her head but she say she would find out",
          "Whenever the Imax theatre productions change, we attend at least one. The experience is worth it! Just attended treasures of China and Wild Africa! Beautiful!",
          "took my grandson 14 yrs old, he loved it. it is great for all ages, then we went into the imax theater to so oceans secrets it was wonderful",
          "Watched a 3D movie as well as visited a few years back with my grandkids to see the Harry Potter exhibition. Both experiences were awesome.",
          "Always a great feature exhibit (Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter, etc), IMAX theatre shows are great, wonderful science activities for the whole family, Star Theatre amazing. A wonderful place for family to learn and be entertained.",
          "We went with a 3 year old and a 7 year old. Our older daughter liked engaging with the various hands on exhibits while the younger one quickly became bored despite having the vast majority of the centre left to explore. The cost was rather high and there was a charge for the",
          "Every time I've been there is always something new and exciting to learn about. Even the regular exhibits are still always fun. The staff is very helpful and the interactive exhibits make it a fun day trip with the family. I attended a wedding at the planetarium under all the",
          "There is something for everyone. All kinds of entertainment geared to learn something about this world of ours. It is a place you can visit more than one time. Time of travel was several times mostly yearly.",
          "Rather you or your kids are curious, this place is for you. Telus World of Science offers a lot to do for all ages throughout the year. They have different themes for example once it was Harry Potter and another time it was Angry Birds, so there is always an exhibit that's new",
          "What a great place for kids and parents alike! A lot of hands on displays, which kept our guests busy the entire day. The IMAX movie 3D experience was well worth the time and would suggest it to anyone attending the World of Science. Can't wait to go back!",
          "Fun night with your family or just friends or date night ......it work very one Alway look to see what is come up next for show ...",
          "Many exhibit and activities to keep children busy. The IMAX theatre always has something interesting for the whole family to watch. Not a far drive from west Edmonton mall area hotels.",
          "With two small children we are always looking for a great activity that's guns for everyone. We love the science centre so much we bought annual passes. The exhibits are great fun and there is always something new to see and try. Be sure to check out the Margaret Ziegler theatre",
          "Had so much fun at Telus World of Science! It is a great place for ALL ages too! Can't wait to go back to see new things!",
          "A bit on the small side as science museums go, but some great interactive galleries and very well presented. We saw two shows in the star theatre, which has a huge hemispheric screen. The space gallery is extremely well done, with all panels in comic book style. We were quite",
          "Took my three kids here and we had a blast. It is a bit on the expensive side for a science exhibit but well worth the money. They had lots of fun activities and I really enjoyed the interactive displays they had repeating throughout the day. We spent a long time with the",
          "Not great for camps, very over priced and the drop off/pick up hours aren't early/late enough. Would recommend City of Edmonton for camps. Telus is over priced.",
          "The Telus World of Science is a really fun interactive place to take your family in Edmonton. They have attractions and interactive educational activities that are geared to all age groups except maybe babies. I have visited it a number of times with my family and they always",
          "Telus World of Science is super cool! They have rotating features like Sherlock Holmes and really cool IMAX films. It's a bit pricey but we typically spend about 3-4 hours there and really enjoy it.",
          "We often attend a show on Boxing Day. The Imax performance we saw was good but there were very few people in attendance. The cost per ticket is very high so it seems that people are choosing more reasonable activities to attend.",
          "We went expecting to only do the Angry Birds exhibit but with the excellent info from the Customer service rep we decided to do an IMAX movie too and spent the entire day at the interactive and educational exhibits. My 3 and 6 year old sons loved the Angry birds exhibit, the",
          "Me and my 13 old son was interested in everything. All I want to touch it. Everything is so clear for children. Great movie theater and planetarium show interesting experiments. Children can learn a lot in this museum. Cool. It is better to come in the morning, less people and",
          "The permanent exhibits are a ton of fun! All our kids (ages ranging from 15-1 year) love coming here. We even decided to become members. However, the recent Angry Birds exhibit was not worth the extra cost. There's a zip line (with really long lineups), life size slingshots",
          "This place is fairly expensive to get into and is not even nearly as exciting as the Ontario Science center. I would never go back. It did not take long to see everything in there and nothing seemed remarkable or exceptional. All in all it was boring and I felt I wasted my",
          "This was an interesting way to spend an hour in the evening with a teen and a pre-teen. We all enjoyed this a lot. The equipment is from 1992 so there was a delay in getting the shoe started but this didn't detract from our experience.",
          "We stopped in to see the Indiana Jones travelling display a few years ago and it was great so we stopped in again and the center is still fun with lots of displays to see and interact with. great for kids.",
          "I have come here multiple times and left feeling disappointed. What they offer here is very bottom line in my taste. If you don't know much about science then it's a good stop but aside from that, it's just for kids.",
          "You can always count on a fun day at this venue. So many interesting facts to learn and interactive things to do. Excellent new exhibits every few months. The new cafe is much better than the previous one. Unfortunately it is a relatively expensive activity for a family and many",
          "An excellent place for people of all ages. Children and youth will be amazed! A great way to learn and in a manner that will be easy to understand and remember. As an adult with a university education I too was impressed with what I learned from our visit.",
          "Our family have been here a number of times - Dinosaur attraction to name one. Kids love it, love the things to do - and love the stars. Sesame Street was there when we went for the kids show and to give them a starting knowledge of the planets in the planetarium. Recommend",
          "science is loved by all ages along with a learning day of hands on fun.You can take part in many super and querky experiments people of all ages will love to take part in,make robots dance,see in giant size how your body works.My boys loved making there little sisters hair stand",
          "This is a great place to take the kids - of all ages - the inner kid in the older members of the group enjoyed as much as the 3 nd 5 year old. Space both inner and out space are explored. Many traveling exhibits and a great planetarium - the star show is a must. For the movie",
          "This is a wonderful place to bring the children and grandchildren. They can learn a lot while having fun and when temperatures are sub-zero, it is a good place for the kids (and adults) to let off some steam. Consider a Family Pass if you are a grandparent wondering what to",
          "I was excited to bring my kids to the Telus world of science for a treat! We had a gift card and for a family of four it still came to $100. We wandered around, it was as if nothing had changed in twenty years, OLD technologies and half the time my kids went to try something it",

          "Compared to the science worlds in Vancouver and Calgary, the Edmonton one falls short in several ways:  toddler area is subpar, exhibits are not as interesting, and there aren\u2019t a lot of exhibits.  It\u2019s always busy here as well... swarming \u2026",

The price is high if you only go once but you should consider getting an annual pass if you go several times a year. You can also apply your annual pass to other science centers across Canada. They offer summer camps as well.",

          "Great way to spend a day learning about all kinds  of things, especially now while the museum is out of commission. Great with kids from toddler on up. Traveling exhibits vary hugely and cost extra(~30$)  but have so far lived up to the hype. Hot tip- try an annual pass if you plan to visit more than twice!",

          "Staff is super friendly - many different things to do. Have come here for a few of the different events - Harry Potter, angry birds and now Pixar. The kids absolutely love it here! A little more on the pricey side, but definitely worth it! \u2026",
          "A great way to spend a cold winter afternoon.  Always interesting exhibits, many are hands on.  Wonderful experience for a child of 7 years or the child at heart of 77 years.",

          "This is by far the worst science museum I have ever been to. Definitely not a hands on museum since nothing in there works. Maybe you guys should use the money you make to update and make things more appealing and fun. Add more stuff to do that works properly and isn't dirty.. disappointed",
          "Our family loves the Telus World of Science. We purchased a family pass last year and will be doing so again this year. The exhibits are fun and interactive. We have enjoyed the visiting exhibits as well. Out recent favorite was Sherlock Holmes. It was fantastic!",

          "Quite a diversity of available content. I took my 4 year old and most of it was too advanced for him, but there was still a lot that engaged him at his level. I would imagine that an 8 year old would get quite a lot more out of the \u2026",

          "Every time I've gone it's been pretty empty, the exhibits are kind of fun, and it's good if you haven't been before. But it's not somewhere I'd go repeatedly. It's smaller than other science museums but it's still nice",
          "We've got a family membership, which is a ridiculously good deal if you come here a few times a year. Lots of activities for young kids and enough stuff to do that you can come once a month and not run out of interesting things for well \u2026",

          "Not worth the money. Few exhibitions with stuff that ain't really exciting.",
          "Seriously if you have been there in the last 20 years dont bother going back as not much has changed.  The kids area is tiny and everything is kinda nasty now.  Needs an update asap.  Not a 50 dollars experience.",
          "The w thus world of science  was amazing I got to go to the body and the star room and the I max was awesome. But not the best the best is the dome theater in the telus world of science . The reason it's a 4 star is the space area is getting kinda old plz upgrade it",
          "My kids ages love going to TElus and we got the 150 dollars memberships for the family so unlimited visits. So worth it for the summer activities. My kids have their own favourite exhibits. We spend at least a day every time. Friendly \u2026",

          "Had a great experience",
          "Excellent place to go for learning science. They have an exhibit for body sciences, ecology, crime and mystery, a kids area, astrophysics, as well as a dome star theater and an Imax theater. You can also book birthday parties, group events, and demos from organizations.",
          "Science can be a lot cooler and far more interesting than what the exhibits reveal. \n\nThe level of science demonstrated is far more interesting to children than teenagers and adults. \n\nI feel they could have put more efforts into the \u2026",
          "Fantastic place, tonnes to do and for all age groups. Definitely check out the maker's garage to the left of the entrance, wow!",
          "It seemed like every other demonstration was broken or not working properly. There was also a ton of kids there on a school trip, which is fine, but I got no warning of the impending chaos upon purchasing our tickets. And school kids in big groups are little jerks.",
          "Great place to take the kids! Although this is kinda a once a year place to go. They have fantastic displays and great roving content.",

          "It was interactive and had many activities suitable for all ages.",
          "It's pretty interesting for somewhat interactive experiences. Lots of information on display and can be quite fun. The price might not appeal to everyone for the experience that you get.",
          "I wish I could still give it 5 stars, but I can't. It used to be very clean and well kept with friendly staff when I would visit years ago, but it's not anymore. Everything seems very bland, the staff look so bored and dead, which in return makes me feel bored and not want to be there. It needs a serious update.",
          "Need a huge reno and updated computer games, it is the same as when i went 10 years ago?  A good 11% of the stuff was not working. Expensive, just saying need to upgrade and then the prices will be fine but not worth it if you are not over the age of 14. The star show was good and the ice melts.",
          "Cool place to go with friends and family. Went to a laser show recently and was not disappointed. They are a little outdated, however, but that is minor. If you haven't been, you should go. ",
          "One of the best attractions in Edmonton for families. The only drawback is it's a bit expensive, but the fun learning opportunities balance that out. They book great travelling exhibitions too. ",
          "My family bought the yearly membership, and it is well worth it if you have children 3yrs or older. A great way to get out of  the house for an afternoon! Try to stay away from the food though, it's high school cafeteria-worthy. ",

          "really great Experience, learned new things. I wish Sherlock was real",
          "Only temporary exhibitions would make sense to visit. The rest needs renovation and as soon as possible. Half of the it is not working or damaged... That place was the first where I regret that I bought annual pass instead of single admission. ",
          "Awesome venue but the permanent exhibits are getting old and dated. Otherwise they have awesome venue come in lately. ",

          "It was sooo busy and there really was not a whole lot to do. I was especially surprised about the lack of interesting exhibits. I am from Saskatchewan and having been to the Regina science center i was very disappiinted wirh the Edmonton one, the Regina one is way better.",
          "It was my first time watching an IMAX movie at TWOS. The movie Extreme Weather was great and the theatre was clean. My only problem the glasses were greasy/dirty and even though I had no problem getting another clean pair from the attendant, that pair had scratched up lenses. ",
          "Highly recommend the Big Bang bundle. Great way to spend a day!",
          "Good way to spend a rainy afternoon. Was there during the body worlds exibit, which was quite interesting and well worth it if you are not too squirmy. Lots of kids of course, but they are short and easy to push away if needed. ",

          "Half of the attractions are broken ALL THE TIME.  Plus the attractions close at 6pm. Not worth the price of admission",
          "Great place for kids.   Also they are free under 3 years old.  ",
          "The science center itself is fantastic. The Star Wars Identities was a lot of fun - wish it was there forever! Bathrooms are extremely clean and you can tell they put a lot of time in making the center look good\nThe staff working the cafe \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Royal Alberta Museum (RAM)  is a museum of human and natural history in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The museum is located in Downtown Edmonton, north of City Hall. The museum is the largest in western Canada with more than 7,600 square metres (82,000 sq ft) exhibition space and 38,900 square metres (419,000 sq ft) in total.\nThe museum was established by the Government of Alberta in December 1967 as the Provincial Museum of Alberta. The museum received royal patronage from Queen Elizabeth II, and was renamed the Royal Alberta Museum in 2005. In 2011, plans were announced to move the museum to a new building. The museums continued to operate from its original building in Glenora, Edmonton until it was closed to the public in December 2015. Although the museum was closed to the public, a number of its departments continued to operate, either preparing the museum's collection for the move, or conducting fieldwork. The new building was completed in August 2016, and was opened to the public in October 2018.\nThe museum features expansive galleries chronicling Alberta's natural and cultural worlds, a feature gallery showcasing travelling exhibitions from Canada and around the world, an interactive, 650 square metres (7,000 sq ft) dedicated children's gallery, and a bug room with live invertebrates and visible nursery.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Canadian Federal Government\u2019s Confederation Memorial Centennial Program and the Government of Alberta began planning for a museum in 1950. In 1962, they hired Raymond O. Harrison, an Australian architect who had been involved in the design of the Vancouver Maritime Museum to direct the planned museum. Harrison was given 5 million dollars to house and staff the museum as well as to build the collections.\n\nThe museum opened to the public December 6, 1967 as the Provincial Museum of Alberta. On opening day, the museum's main floor featured galleries presenting the fur trade; native peoples of Alberta; early photographs of aboriginal people taken by Ernest Brown and Harry Pollard. Second floor galleries were less incomplete, but featured exhibits on agriculture; \"pioneer\" life; and industry and commerce. The museum expanded through the 1960s and 1970s with more exhibits, curatorial programs and staff. In 1968, new exhibits portraying Alberta's dinosaurs and \"Adaptations for Survival\" were added to the natural history section, and permanent exhibits of \"Vehicles of Alberta's Past\", \"Uniforms of RCMP Superintendant H. C. Forbes\", \"R. R. Gonsett, Inventor\" and \"Early Building in Saskatchewan\" were added to the human history section. In 1969, exhibits on volcanos, the thrush family were added to that natural history gallery, and displays of \"Domestic Artifacts of Utility\", the history of aboriginal people (including a display of Blackfoot clothing), and new agricultural artifacts were added to the human history gallery. The same year, a diorama of Pronghorns was created as the first of sixteen planned displays of Alberta's natural habitat.In 1981, the provincial museum's palaeontology program, including many of the program's staff and collection, was split from the museum in 1981 by the provincial government. The palaeontology program was spun off in order to facilitate the establishment of the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, opened in 1985.Paid admission began in 1990, and to increase its audience the ground floor Indian Gallery was removed and the space used for feature exhibition space. In 1991, the mammal and bird gallery was upgraded with a display on \"Survival and Reproduction\", and the following year the \"Beauty and Science of Birds\" exhibit was built, including three new dioramas and a \"Naturalist's Study\". \nA temporary exhibit called \"The Bug Room\" in the summer of 1992 featured live insects, and it was so successful that the museum decided to bring it back as a larger and permanent component of the museum in 1993. A new permanent \"Earth Science Gallery\" was partially opened in December 1993, though not fully completed until the following May. Also in 1993, the museum launched the \"In All Their Finery\" exhibit of aboriginal artifacts as the first phase of the larger \"Syncrude Gallery of Aboriginal Culture.\" The complete Syncrude gallery was inaugurated years later in November 1997. This gallery was later complemented with a large purchase from the family of James Carnegie at a Sotheby's auction on 8 May 2006. The sale of the \"James Carnegie Collection\" was billed as the most significant auction of North American Indian artifacts to date, including a prized beaded dress collected in 1859 which cost US$497,600.\n\nIn 2003, the Habitat Gallery was greatly renovated into a new \"Wild Alberta\" interactive exhibit. From 2002 to 2006, the Royal Alberta Museum hosted the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop's groundbreaking \"Big Things\" outdoor sculpture exhibition series on the South Terrace.In 2005, Alberta's centennial year, the NESW produced the RAM's Alberta Centennial Sculpture Exhibition, and on 24 May 2005, Queen Elizabeth II visited, bestowing royal patronage. On December 6, 2015, the museum closed down 48 years after its opening in 1967 to move to a new location.\n\n\n=== New building ===\nIn April 2011, it was announced that a new building for the Royal Alberta Museum would be built in Downtown Edmonton, north of the city hall and Law Courts, and east of the CN Tower, on the land formerly occupied by Canada Post's Edmonton station. The 36,000 m2 (390,000 sq ft) building, which contains twice as much gallery space, was estimated to cost $340 million, and was completed in 2015. Premier Stelmach and the Alberta government have said that the location of the new building could be used for the terminal of an Edmonton\u2014Calgary high speed rail line, while the old location will be the site for a new residence for the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nConstruction of the new building was completed on August 16, 2016, and the opening date of October 3, 2018, was announced on September 12, 2018. The new building is the largest museum in western Canada with more than 7,600 square metres (82,000 sq ft) of exhibition space and 38,900 square metres (419,000 sq ft). The museum features expansive galleries chronicling Alberta's natural and cultural worlds, a feature gallery showcasing travelling exhibitions from Canada and around the world, an interactive, 650 square metres (7,000 sq ft) dedicated children's gallery, and a bigger bug room with live invertebrates and visible nursery. The total cost of the new building and moving is estimated around CAD $375.5 million, with $253 million from the Government of Alberta, and $122.5 million from the federal government Building Canada Fund.[5]\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe collections are divided into four main categories:\n\nLife Science: Botany, Ichthyology/Herpetology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mammalogy and Ornithology Program \u2013 577,745 objects\nEarth Science: Archaeology, Geology, Quaternary Paleontology, and Quaternary Environments \u2013 9,224,075 objects\nHuman History: Ethnology, Cultural Studies (formerly Folk Life), Military and Political History (formerly Government History) and Western Canadian History \u2013 137,610 objects\nCollections Services: Collections Management, Conservation, Information Resource Management, Resource Library \u2013 70,103 objectsBetween 1989 and 2001, 175 travelling exhibitions were displayed at the museum.

          "My son and I visited this museum. We have a Danish ancestry and were especially delighted to be able to visit the Viking exhibition. We spent literally hours seeing all the exhibits. I would love to go again on a next visit to Edmonton. The parking was easily accessible and",

          "We wanted to check out the new museum. Now I've seen it I may never need to return. It is brand new so it is clean & young looking. Because you have to pay for parking it makes it very expensive to visit if you don't live nearby. We paid as much to park as the adult entry",
          "We were traveling though Edmonton and wanted to see a special exhibit that they had. We also visited a few of their other exhibits and were overall very happy. If you are traveling with children, then this museum rates 5 stars. Most of the displays are geared towards children.",
          "The Royal Alberta Museum is definitely geared towards the young ones and families, which is totally OK. Charging almost $20 for a visit is a bit of a stretch for this place, in my opinion. You are definitely better off getting the Mammoth Pass for $35 you get to visit all year",
          "A far cry from the beautiful old RAM. A very disappointing visit. New location has no parking in a very sketchy area of town (felt uncomfortable walking with family from parking lot which was quite expensive, to museum). Exhibits were mediocre at best. Don\u2019t waste your time",

          "Unfortunately, there was not an underground parking garage, but we found pay parking in the city hall nearby. The museum was very busy with many children in the special exhibit, but the spacious layout helped with the flow. Unfortunately, the noise level was high, but it would",

          "There is a huge Viking exhibit just inside the main doors. Strange thinking: I thought this was an Alberta museum, but the RAM has gone ga-ga over a people group who never visited this far west. Call it Canadian history if you wish, but it would have been nice to see more Viking",

          "Visited here this past Jan. It is an amazing museum. still had some of the feel of the old site but much more extensive. Well worth a visit and expect to spend at least 2-3 hours. We were in the bug display for almost an hour alone!",
          "Visited on a weekday and it was quiet. The museum is new and it\u2019s gorgeous! Clean and modern. Loved the exhibit. There are two main exhibits - human history and animal/ nature focused. Great place to spend 2 hours! Would recommend.",
          "The building itself is stunning. It's open and modern while still remaining inviting. The exhibits, especially in the natural history section, are really well done. But, for our family, the star of the show was the kids play area. It was easily one of the best we've been",
          "There are muliple exhibits. We had childern from 2-12 years old and all enjoyed themselves. The childern enjoyed the Childerns Exhibit- so did us adults playing in the sand learning area. There is also a lot of history in the other Exhibits. My least favourite was the Bug",

          "There's nothing like this in Alberta, and we think it's likely the very best museum in the province. It covers human and natural history, and their displays are quite spectacular. They change up techniques quite a bit, so there's no monotony here, with videos, large photographs,",
          "An 81 year old friend and I went to the museum for the first time. We enjoyed all the exhibits on the first floor. Some exhibits reminded her of her past. I liked seeing the unique history of Alberta. We spent 2 hours on the first floor but she was too tired to continue so I",
          "There is alot to see and take in, perhaps too much for one visit. Some of the displays were not working or missing a creature. I am critical of things like that because i paid full price to see it. It was not a reduced price that day. The whole idea of interactive learning is",
          "I was quite impressed with the overall organization of the extensive exhibits on the two floors of the RAM. Both the Human History floor and the Natural History Floor were extremely detailed and diverse, designed to keep visitors engaged and informed. It was very busy when I was",
          "They did a wonderful job building and planning this new museum! Perfect for date night or for the whole family! The lockers are terrible as they eat your change and many are broken. There is space to eat lunch if you bring your own but they need more tables and chairs. There is",
          "We went for our first time yesterday. We were huge fans of the old museum. I think the displays were very well done. However it is a LOT of reading. Which is fine if you want to read (like my husband). I found it overwhelming. It took us an hour to go through the first",
          "Many of the exhibits seem to be from the old museum, such as the beautiful dioramas. The wildlife dioramas are beautiful and impressive. The dinosaur exhibits are not as good as old but still good. The bug section is very good but needs to be expanded. The added play",
          "After visiting we ended up buying the annual passes - if you visit more than twice it is a great deal. The bug room was interesting- I was expecting dead bugs on display- but most of the bugs and spiders are alive. The upstairs room has dinosaurs, animal diaramas and rocks. The",
          "We've been here multiple times now and it is a very nice building, and the children's area, bug area and human history gallery in particular were enjoyable. The Annual Pass is a good deal and we've made use of it during this particularly long winter we've just had. Gift shop and",
          "The building is designed to catch the eye both inside and out. However, the flow is a bit unclear with some parts of the museum not really flowing smoothly into the other. Take time to go up the second set of stairs to see the area set aside for meditation around a sacred",
          "Having never visited the old museum I was unsure what to expect. The building is spacious and kept clean. When we visited there were no lines for tickets but lines did develop for food later in the day as we were heading out. Both feature exhibit areas were closed for our visit",
          "As a first time visitor to Alberta it was wonderful to learn about the history of the province in the sleek stunning new museum. It was a wonderful layout, exciting and modern exhibits and plenty of opportunity to sit, reflect and take it all in. The food at the cafe was",
          "The museum is beautiful, and the exhibits are very well displayed and curated. I felt I got a good idea of Alberta's history and creation. The museum was smaller than I expected but everything else made up for that. The cafe was good and the lockers were cheap. And as I said",
          "We have a family mammoth pass which is a ridiculous $70 for the year. To skip the weekend line ups, it\u2019s worth it just for that. We tend to only do one or two galleries when we go because they are so detailed and immersive experiences. My kids are older so the kids activity room",
          "Ticket booth confusing and congested.No mention that both main galleries were closed and not opening for several months.Exhibits that were open boring and same as old museum.For the hundreds of millions spent not impressed.",
          "Underwhelming experience - only 2 (permanent) exhibits were open to the public. Human History section was a 2/10, and the Natural History section was a 7.5/10 at best. No \u201cfeature exhibit\u201d should call for a discounted entrance fee. Inefficient check-in, and entrance/exit line",
          "I am proud to say that the new RAM museum ranks with other museums that I have visited around the world. It is a beautiful building and the displays are very well presented. It is not as big as museums in NY or London but that is nice as it is very doable in a 2-3 hour visit.",
          "I loved the old building and there is something \"modern\" about the new but the exhibits are just as good and engaging. A fine collection of dinosaur, mineral, insects,and \"human\" collection. I liked it so much I bought a year pass (cheaper than two single admissions!)",
          "I have been to many museums before and I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect with this one. The building is bran new and beautiful, and the exhibits are quite unique. My entire group, filled with people with totally different interests loved this museum. I really liked the natural",
          "I finally got around to familiar sights and new ones. The rotunda is beautiful and bright. Of course every Edmonton 'kid' has fond memories of the old one but change is progress. Saw many old friends in the dioramas and skeletons including the big meteorite with the holes in it",
          "Very impressed with this new Museum, no expense spared. The kids section is so well thought out, lots of interactive play areas, probably the best science related play area I have ever seen, better than Telus World of Science. The Museum itself is amazing, it's over 2 floors so",
          "Where to start... okay, a positive: for kids, or people who haven't been to really great museums or galleries or compelling public spaces... a trip here might not be terrible. I did see lots of families with small kids enjoying the bug room and the family oriented exhibits, and",
          "Our 3 families of 6 adults and 4 children 6 and under enjoyed a 4 hour visit to this new museum. There was plenty to attract and interest the youngsters so they were enthralled for the full time with both the natural and historical sides of the museum. The children's explore",

          "I'm not sure what I was expecting having been to the old location and getting mixed reviews on the new location. Beautiful building, and the exhibits are really well done. Easy to spend a couple hours here. My only complaint would be that I wish there were more galleries",
          "This is a very interesting museum to visit, to obtain a rich and varied understanding of the Alberta area. Plenty of information from the geological history, to that of man in the region. I would suggest a least three hours.",
          "The boring architectural design is reflected in a boring 1960's museum vibe once you walk in. Displays rely on small font tiny card explanations that for some reason are below one's waistline - you need to bend over to read. The Human History gallery has a significant Indigenous",

          "Having spent so much time at the old museum, I waited with anticipation for this one to open. I would have rated it higher if all of the galleries were ready; however, I am now privileged to take my grandchildren to a place that has wide open spaces, friendly staff, a fantastic",
          "I had such grand expectations for this museum after a decade in the planning and construction not to mention $375 million in tax dollars. To say I was disappointed is a massive understatement - the curators seemed to skip over 113 years of how Alberta was developed since 1905.",
          "Spent a few hours exploring the museum. Overall impression was \" nice start but needs work\". Highlights included the Ice age fossils, some of the interactive displays, and the wildlife dioramas. Downside was that here were no displays depicting any urban history, any settler",
          "There were four adults in my group. We were greeted by two lovely ladies at the door. everyone working there was happy to answer any questions and point us in the right direction. The museum was very well marked for direction and exhibits. Lots to see! We were there for 2 hours",
          "Best thing about this museum is the family pass price. Before I even came to this museum I bought a family pass because it seemed the cheapest way to go. If I bought two adult passes alone it was no more money to buy a family pass. I think the idea is for people to buy family",
          "We only had a chance to explore the kids area on this visit. The bug room was phenomenal, with the Mantis Shrimp a big highlight. You can tell the staff there are very engaged and enthusiastic to teach about the critters on hand. The children's area was also fun for a range",

          "Possibly one of the better museums I have been to, well situated and tons of history. I didn't even get through all of it",
          "One of my all-time favorite places to go, I find it very peaceful and relaxing, there's so much to look at and learn about, there's no cost just a suggested donation box which I would highly recommend putting in to so that the museum can keep operating for years to come.",
          "Spectacular exhibits from Geology to nature exhibits that are so real you think the animals are waiting for you behind the glass - very very well done! You learn more about the native first nations and they have feature exhibits as well. Well worth the time.",
          "This museum is great but the new one to open will undoubtedly be even better. There are both permanent displays (animals and first nation) and ones that are for a short period of time.",
          "Place is ok if person never was in a really good museum. I understand that history of Edmonton is pretty fresh n green, but I think it's a bad idea to fill empty space with pics of fast food. Fast food is not decent part of any culture. Now it's moving to a bigger place which I",

          "Probably one of the coolest places Edmonton has to visit, especially on a week day when it is slower. The live bugs are absolutely amazing and if you're lucky you can handle a few of them. Always something going on here, and definitely worth the entrance fee. See it before it",

          "This museum is closing soon and will be relocated in a downtown location. The museum has outgrown itself. It's been said that there are far more artifacts in storage than are displayed. If you are visiting from out of the province, the chief attraction would be the display of",
          "Beautiful grounds but dated museum. Seriously it hasn't changed much at all since the 1980's but it will be closing soon as we are getting a NEW Royal Alberta Museum in downtown in the next couple years. So I would suggest you go and enjoy the beautiful limestone building, and",
          "Lots of historic information and taxidermy animals of the area. The building is on a large site over looking Groat road and downtown Edmonton. Lots to read there.",
          "This place is awesome and I expect it will be even more so in its new building. Its a great way to spend a few hours with family.",
          "Allow a few hours to truly see all the amazing artifacts in this well displayed exhibit. . If you enjoyed Fort Edmonton you must follow up with this beautifully presented perspective on the Plains Indians and Matis .",
          "It is not that large a museum, but that is to be remedied soon with a new location being built in the center of Edmonton's downtown core.",
          "Went here in June with our family while visiting Edmonton. Really nice clean museum with a lot of great artifacts from the area. Great information available with nice exhibits ranging from local artists work, life-size dinosaur models, animals from the surrounding areas,",
          "Road construction sucks! The road in front is being worked on and we sure had a hard time finding our way there. It was, however, well worth the effort! We had a whole day to kill, good thing! We spent a little too much time in the portion of the museum that features all the",
          "This is a very beautiful museum nestled at the top of the famous Edmonton river valley. Take some time to walk around the well-kept grounds if it's a nice day. The Aboriginal Exhibit on the second floor is really well done with Aboriginal history brought right up to the",
          "6 of us went to the Museum.....kids, teenage, parents, grandparent. It was a great day for all of us. We easily saw all the exhibits in a few hours. It was big enough to be a good use of a half day, but not so big that the kids got tired. I look forward to coming back once",
          "We intended to go to the mall but changed our minds when we realized the museum was nearby. This is an excellent museum and we noticed that it had something for everyone. This is the best Native exhibit and collection we have seen and does a good job of explaining the history",
          "I keep coming back here as it has a couple of excellent galleries. Especially the wild Alberta and the aboriginal galleries. Nice location with plenty of parking and lovely grounds. Cafe could be better. the museum is moving in the near future and hopefully it will be",
          "The museum offers tons of things to see and learn about Alberta. It is really worth going, but safe an entire afternoon.",
          "I visited to see the First Nations exhibit and was not disappointed, particularly the archaeology, Plains, and Subarctic cultures exhibits. Geology exhibits were interesting, especially the Pleistocene megafauna and dinosaurs of Alberta. Cafe was tasty.",
          "This museum has a little bit of everything so can appeal to a wide range of people. It's not that big, easy to navigate, friendly staff and a nice main entrance... we enjoyed the 'Worn to be Wild' temporary exhibit and the main exhibits.",
          "This is a throwback museum. A lot of dedication and effort into maintaining this one and staying relevant. I don't imagine the exhibitions change much, but this is a great museum to just wander around in and take your time. Classic Canadiana and great atmosphere.",
          "I visited the museum to see the Wildlife Photographer of The Year! It was just my luck that the exhibition started 2 days before I left the country. The exhibition showcases the mind-boggling beauty of the natural world, put in a frame by professionals, amateurs and children \u2014",
          "We went with our 5 year old son and he enjoyed the visit a lot. They had a show on wild life photography which was amazing and a nice collection of wild animals, bugs and butterflies and minerals. Suggestion: visit on Sat/Sun between 9-11AM as the entry rates are half",
          "Just to let people know, the Royal Museum has a full sized movie theatre and part of it is used to host the Edmonton Film Society's showing of movies that belong in a museum. The screenings are certain Monday nights, Fall to Spring, Attendance is quite good. There is",
          "This museum does not really stand out as far as museums go. Honestly it is not to say it is a bad place to visit, on the contrary it is a place you should visit if your a museum goer. However it is just nothing really special.",
          "If you or your kid's like minerals, or bugs this is the place to go the admission alone is worth it even if this is the only exhibit you go to see. I spend a good four hours here and hope to go back soon.",

          "My grand daughter and I visit the museum at least once a year and we are never disappointed. We love the bug display. We enjoy the rocks. We love the North American Animals and the Native American section.",
          "Great place to visit and interesting displays. Too bad, they moving it closer to downtown area. NOT partical at all. A must visit for tourist visiting the city of chumps oh should say champions. Yet we have not won a grey cup or stanley cup for at least 5 years or more.",
          "A great afternoon out with the family to take in all the nature of all the animals that surround our area as well as the the rock museum and see all the different kinds of stones and rocks that have been found. Take in one of the shows that is showing. Also I have been with a",
          "Wonderful place, fantastic displays, my favorite was the rock and gem section. The restaurant food is really good, the gift shop had a good variety of products for diverse budgets. Very helpful museum staff. My teen son and I really enjoyed our visit, will go again!",
          "The wildlife dioramas in this museum are quite spectacular and would be worth a visit in themselves. We also much enjoyed the \"First Nations\" section which was well laid out and really interesting. Would like to have had more time",

          "The museum always changes things up with a theme. So it has the staple good stuff but you can go back more than once because they have special exhibits...a must see in Edmonton",
          "Although there is not much places you can visit in Edmonton, RAM is a nice place to check out. Not very big, but pretty neat.",
          "The museum tends to keep changing some of their exhibits. Some of the past exhibits were Queen Elizabeth II her self, Lego, and Butterflies. All of the permanent exhibits are also interesting. Upstairs they have live insects (creepy crawlys like spiders and cockroaches). If you",

          "Something for everyone here, and also have \"special interest\" travelling exhibits. I go a couple times/yr and always find something new that I never noticed before or that grabs my attention. Keep an eye on their website for new developments...yes, at the museum lol.",
          "Love it here everytime, the location is the greatest, real mistake to move this place. Will probably never attend again once they move to a rough area of Edmonton. Does not make sense to leave such a historic and beautiful area of the city.",
          "We have enjoyed this museum several times and brought friends and family to see it when they were visiting. The Wild Alberta exhibit is educational and a great way to learn about wildlife from Alberta. We also love the rocks and minerals section and bug room. The First Nation",
          "Recently took a trip to the Royal Alberta Museum and was very disappointed! They do have a good display of stone and minerals, drawers with specimens to look at and an extensive taxidermy collection but that is where it stops. They have a very poor fossil and dino display and",
          "Superb exhibits, carefully arranged and very well described, cover the geology and extraordinary natural history of Alberta in particular and Canada in general. A really first class room covering the First Nation people and their experiences is a highlight. I am not a huge",

          "Quite a mixed group at the Museum. Fun to see variety of people experience the exhibits. Road construction made it a challenge to get there",
          "Really good Native People's and excellent flora and fauna exhibits. They are set up in traditional manner rather than the more modern interactive exhibits being done in new museums. Nonetheless they are well done and very informative and interesting. And the little cafe is",
          "Very good exhibit on the Native American history and culture. Very informative and interesting. Also large rock exhibit.",
          "This was a great museum with alot of explanation about the history of the aboriginal communities. Well worth a visit and the grounds of Government house are also beautiful.",
          "I just love provincial museums. They always have so many neat things to look at and history to learn!",
          "Looking forward to the larger, new museum we will have soon ( by 2016) downtown. Present museum is nice, pacts a fair amount of Alberta history inside, but lacks compared to many other Provincial museums",
          "A nice \"small\" local museum. They had a nice exhibit about leather jackets and the second floor aboriginal exhibit was well worth the visit.",
          "The best part for this museum is learning the history of human and evolution. Nothing too interesting but just keep learning. Not too crowded at anytime.",
          "Very nice museum that covers the native people and geologic history of Alberta. Recommended to those interested in learning more about the area.",
          "Liked exhibition of all the different artifacts there large exhibit on native artwork. Lifts available, some parts wheelchair friendly.",
          "In the government of albertas infinite wisdom this excellent facility will be relocated to a horrid location in skid row. Wonder what will become of the excellent not well attended building sitting on prime real estate overlooking the river valley.",
          "Its a lovely property in a nice location. Staff are knowledgable and the exhibits are always great. the animal showcases are a big hit with kids. Do eat in the cafe.",
          "There was a great deal of construction on the way to the museum when we were there but it was worth the effort to get there. The presentation of the exhibits was first rate. We especially liked the Syncrude Gallery of Aborginal Culture. So much interesting information and great",
          "Pros: Some nice exhibits about the history of the people and wildlife of Alberta. Some living bugs and fish to see. A good collection of minerals. Cons: The museum has lots of stuffed animals (the taxidermy type) on display. They are the large part of at least two exhibits.",
          "I clearly expected better for the name. Not much to see and the exhibits were old school as far as collections of stuffed animals and rocks. No real information or educational value. Fossil/dinosaur room was just plain sad. Maybe they figure everyone goes to Tyrrell so why",
          "So far this is one of the best museums I ever seen, I wish it was bigger, the place is awesome, kind of difficult to get there because of the road repairs but once we got there it was amazing, the building is very beautiful from the outside, the cost is half price if you get",
          "Displays were interesting and well arranged. I need to go back to finish seeing things. Allow about 4 hours if you are the thorough type...2.5 hr if you speed through things.",
          "I have been to this museum several times since I was a young girl, and every time I have absolutely loved it. This time I brought my four year old son with me, and he spent two hours (and could have stayed longer) going through each of the exhibits. The interactive",
          "We had a blast on a rainy day. Sat and sun morning they have 50% discount. It was a great value for the price. The kids leant so much and even the adults had a blast. A MUST do :)",
          "Although they are currently digging up the bridge which leads to the Museum, the museum itself has arranged a free mini bus which will get you there from around the immediate area. Compared to a lot of museums, this is great value for money and the exhibitions are excellent.",
          "A few good permanent exhibits and saw the new ones about fibre art and the black leather jacket. This last one was well done. Not expensive which suits the small size of the museum. Really hard to find with the road construction.",
          "Entertaining and nicely-organized museum with displays on Aboriginals, wildlife, plants, and insects of Alberta along with temporary displays.",
          "Nice on the outside, nicer still inside the museum. One gets to understand the history of Alberta especially the Canadian Indians. One also gets to know the flora and fauna of Alberta. There is also a nice cafe and souvenir shop",
          "The museum offers half price admission on weekend mornings between 9 and 11 AM. There was a display on leather jackets but the best stuff was natural history: live bugs, minerals and wildlife dioramas. There was also an interesting section on aboriginal history. Very interesting",
          "This is a wonderful place to spend a day. Tons of exhibits to view, interactive stations and multimedia presentations. A MUST DO if your in Alberta!",
          "Oddly, the outside statues, the building itself, and the decorated trees, plus the nice park and amazing river views - - those were what made the location great. Plus the mammoth logo rocks. But inside there was remarkably little to see. There was a really great lounge upstairs.",
          "It is the best museum around. The location is so convenient and accessible. Love the exhibits -always take my grandchildren there and they love the store and restaurant. Such a family treat!",
          "there was a ngreat exhibit on at the museum we decided to take in. Lots of things to see, several floors of wall to wall. It was very good",
          "It's a shame but this is not worth the cost of admission once you get in the door there is not a lot to do. Very dated building poor food choices and attraction have not been changed in years",
          "Having been most impressed by the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, B.C., I was prepared to be singularly unimpressed by the RAM. Au contraire: The Wild Alberta exhibit is breathtaking - the dioramas fusing taxidermy and almost magical landscape painting were stunningly",
          "I used to visit Royal Alberta Museum when my kids were small. It's a nice place to take kids to. I don't seem to enjoy it now that my kids no longer want to go with me anymore.",
          "We had a very enjoyable couple of hours in this museum. We went as soon as they opened on Sat and got in for half price. The rocks and gems were incredible, and so were the butterflies, the kids loved the spiders too. The dioramas in the wild Alberta exhibit were fantastic.",
          "This museum is huge and very well organized. The displays are top notch and the information supplied everywhere is very clear and interesting. One of my fave places to go in Edmonton.",
          "I take my grandkids, aged 3 & 5, here several times a year and they always love it. They enjoy the life size dioramas of Albertan animals downstairs. Upstairs they enjoy the live insects, some of which they've been able to hold when a museum staff member has been tending them.",
          "There are three permanent displays: Natural History gallery Syncrude Gallery of Aboriginal Culture Wild Alberta gallery Also, there is a feature one that changes every few months. The staff are very pleasant and helpful.",
          "This place is worth to visit. It's good for family to spend time together. I really enjoyed here. Plan to visit again soon.",
          "I like wandering around museums generally. This is no worse and better than some I have visited. Nothing of exceptional note, just the usual geological, wildlife and local items. It is easy to walk around and well laid out. It is well lit and airy with plenty of space to just",
          "Its a great place to take children from ages 4 to 10 after that they may find it boring, not to many interactive items or exciting things to look at for older children.",
          "Royal Alberta museum is a nice place to visit, it has some interesting exhibitions. and when you are done you can go visit goverment hill, it is a nice area with a good view.",
          "A wonderful building, well laid out. The aboriginal section is remarkable and the geological section superb - it is amazing what mother earth hides from us. Gift shops are inevitable, but this one is worth a visit. Unbelievably the Royal Alberta Museum is going to be replaced",
          "We spent the afternoon at the Royal Alberta Museum with our grandchildren, ages 2 and 7. We had a wonderful time. The baby was mesmerized by many of the exhibits. A full-sized moose, mountain lion, and a bison are a real big deal when you are two. Know admission costs are",
          "we were not impressed with the museum. maybe the plan is to develop it more and do a great one, but right now it kind of needs some renos and some different galleries would be great.",
          "The standard content of the Alberta landscapes are awesome and the current chair exhibition and Chop Suey on the Praries is wonderful as well. Go on the weekend before 11am and get in for half price too.",
          "The museum is a short trip out of downtown but worth a visit. The exhibits were very interesting, especially the First Nations history and the Alberta wildlife. The cafe was much better than I had expected for lunch.",
          "Although the museum is improving, and getting more travelling exhibits, the museum is still average compared to other museums I have been to. While I haven't been there with kids in my group in a while, the children that were there when I visited recently seemed to enjoy the",
          "We went to see the First Nations cultural exhibit - it was extremely well done. Good visuals with lots of artifacts. Excellent text explaining the exhibits and the historical context. Very, very well done. Recommend highly and we will return!",
          "We had been to the Royal Alberta Museum once before in 2003 when it was still the Provincial Museum. Ten years later, we visited here again. The museum consists of 3 permanent exhibits, \"Wild Alberta\", \"Natural History\" and \"Aboriginal History\". There is also the temporary",
          "another must see if in Edmonton great history on the first nations people really worthwhile spending a few hours",
          "If you go before 11 am on the weekend, you get in half price! Our kids love the entire museum ~ the animal displays, the dinosaur room and the amazing bug room! This is one of the things that we recommend you must do in Edmonton!",
          "The building is beautiful - lots of marble, and easy access to floors. The special exhibits are well worth seeing. There is a nice gift shop and coffee place. Always worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful museum. Great exhibits. And fantastic Museum Fries! A must for the whole family. You could easily spend 4 or 5 hours there. Truly a great treat!",
          "While I love going to the museum it only takes an hour to visit and doesn't change enough during the year. My small children have seen it all and are bored.",
          "We have been going there since our now grown kids were little, my favorites are the geology and precious stones exhibit, the bird and butterfly exhibit and the natural habitat wildlife exhibits. The scenic artists and the mural work in the exhibits are beautifully done, and the",
          "This is a great museum, well documented, nicely done, and very educative. I learned a lot about the natural beauty of Alberta, its geolgical history and some about the local first nation inhabitants. A great museum, worth the detour.",
          "i took my class on 2 guided programs- fantastic educational & meaningful experience.... im excited for the new museum!....but love this one.....ive been going since i was little....breautiful grounds, and exhibits!! cafeteria- rude & slow service...SHOCKING",
          "Due to a medical issue I had to use a wheelchair during a recent visit to the museum-I called ahead to assure myself that a chair would be available-not only did staff meet me at the door they made the process of obtaining a chair very easy. They gave us a map of the museum",
          "Very well maintained very interesting. Nice details in the exhibits. Almost as good as our Royal Saskatchewan museum in Regina.",
          "We purchase an annual pass for myself and my children, and for $35 per year, you can't beat the value! There are very interactive exhibits available for younger children, and a daily storytime in which children learn about a certain topic and then receive a stamp on their",
          "For someone visiting Edmonton this is a must see place to go. The exhibits are fantastic and they have an exhibit hall that they change the exhibit regularly. The 3D wildlife exhibits are so lifelike and are one of my favorites.",
          "I always enjoy my visits to the Royal Alberta Museum. The animal exhibit is my favorite. They even have live fish native to Canada. The temporary featured exhibits are always extremely well presented. Over the years they have expanded, and I look forward to see what they add in",
          "Many interesting and ever changing exibits. Great for the whole family. Please visit this museum. The special exibits can be spectacular!!!",
          "The Royal Alberta Museum has standard exhibits as well as special showings that change hroughout the year. I haven't been able to get there in the last year but they always have something interesting on show.",
          "First time to this museum and boy does it have a lot of cool stuff! We love the animals and outdoor and the displays were amazing and so life like. I liked the aboriginal culture and the animals of alberta sections.",
          "Went on a Saturday morning when entry was half price and was there for 4 hours! There was a LOT to read and to see and do. Too much for one visit. The cafe is worth a visit too. Also excellent value!",
          "Well laid out museum, hands on educational exhibits include dinosaurs, wildlife, indigenous culture. Allow a couple hours to walk through. Good for kids and adults.",
          "This was a very enjoyable experience. The exhibitions are laid out well and very informative. I unfortunately didn't have enough time to see it all as thoroughly as I would have liked. I spent over 3 hours there and it did not seem like it at all. If it hadn't been closing",
          "I found the exhibits informative and educational. My favorites were the gallery of minerals and the history of Chinese restaurants. Very interesting museum and affordable admission price.",
          "There are exhibits of interest to everyone. I like the displays recreating life on the prairies hundreds of years ago and the nature displays of native animals and birds.",
          "Great tour, would definitely recommend for people driving through the area or visiting Edmonton to check it out",
          "I knew I was spending a lot of time in Alberta on my holiday so I had bought an annual pass to the Alberta historical sites which included entry to the museum so I went along. I'm glad I did. It was well laid out and interesting. Plenty to look at for adults and kids alike",
          "The Royal Alberta Museum has always been a favorite place of mine. I love to see the exhibits and attend special events there. I am sure that I have been there at least 20 times, and each time I learn something hew.",
          "I'm from Edmonton so this museum is available to me whenever I want and if it's any indication for you, I have a annual pass. I went there to study when I was younger and now that I'm \"all grown up\", I bring my daughter here. Is it a world class museum? No, but it's still",
          "Cannot miss the Native exhibits or the Wildlife exhibits! Everything is very interesting and educational.",
          "Nothing to dislike, beautiful, interesting, hostorical, terrific view, grounds, beautiful building.....great for wedding pics. I go at least once per year...it is sooo nice!",
          "Having just nice from BC, we were expecting something at the same level of the Royal BC Museum. Sadly this was not the case. That being said, the wildlife and bug area are great for kids, and the admission is very reasonable. The museum seems to have a lot of empty space, and",
          "Just the right size and price for an outing for young families. The young ones will especially enjoy the natural Wildlife dioramas with sound effects!",
          "Just average stuff and not much of collection. Can visit once and then what. Whats the worth of membership fee?",
          "Would have liked to see more on the pioneers of Alberta, the oil industry and development of the resource in Alberta. Very interesting exhibits on the first nations people.",
          "Took five grandchildren who needed feeding, they were happy, children's menu and the adult food was okay, but the focus of the outing was the museum which was excellent. The insect section was a big hit",
          "It was a thrill to return to a childhood haunt. The museum featured dishes and trinkets from many eras of Russian history and the importance fine dishware and ornaments played as gifts to royalty and the well heeled. A bit boring and dry but the history part of the china was",
          "I visited over a year ago, to view the Bata shoe exibit. The museum was smaller than I expected, but the layout was well done, and the grounds are pretty.",
          "There is a hugh diplay of Alberta history under this roof. From the artifacts to the stuffed animals, that have all been well done and to a high quality standard, there is something of interest to all who go here.",
          "I was recommended this as something to do during a 4 day trip to Edmonton. I left a bit disappointed. First off, it's pricey to get in. Second, the exhibits are very much so lacking. Last, it's much smaller than I thought it'd be. Maybe 4 exhibits total? If you have nothing",
          "the exhibits are changing all the time so there is something new every time i go, never gets boring even with the fixed exhibits, a step back in time makes you realise what our forefathers went through to settle this land.",
          "I like the fact that this museum is not too big. It's well laid out and has some beautiful dioramas of natural habitat in Alberta. I like the Native Canadian section which has some wonderful displays demonstrating Native history of the area.",
          "Very interesting... lots to see. Plan on spending 3-4 hours... more if you have kids that are interested in science / exploring interesting stuff!",
          "This is to say the least a hoot if your into history past and present. No more needs to be said. You like museums or you don't.",
          "We took our children here several times when they were young. Once, it was a school trip when there was a special exhibit. This place has great things to look at which help children (and adults) to learn about the history of Alberta. It is interesting, and actually used to be",
          "Look this is a nice Museum but it really needs life breathed into it. The exhibits seldom change, though they are well done. If you have never been you will enjoy your first two visits but after that it is the same old thing. They often have a seperate display on the main floor",
          "Fantastic exhibits from the outside and indoor areas. Lots of native artwork. This is a great primer before you hit the Natural museum where the dinosaur originals are kept. Don't forget that there is a gigantic amount of dinosaurs in the oil fields, the largest ever discovered.",
          "Reasonably priced for a family of 4 with an AMA discount. I would have expected more kid-oriented displays, though our 5- and 7-year-olds enjoyed most of the displays and it was nice to visit a place that wasn't themed entirely for kids. The Aboriginal exhibit specifically",
          "An eclectic collection of exhibits, extremely well presented. The site of the museum in an older area of Edmonton by the river is wonderful. Mixed feelings about it closing and being moved downtown.",
          "About 20 minutes by bus from the Downtown area. Four halls of exhibits. Give yourself at least two and half hours to get round the exhibits. If you like museums, you'll like this one.",
          "The museum has an wonderful display of First Nations life past and present. You can wander through the tipis and sit beneath Northern Lights. Their story is told with paintings, and objects, music and photos. However, our family's favorite area is the Wild Alberta area -- a",

          "I very much enjoy practically any museum but especially this one as so much of the history - natural and man-made - is offered up in the museum. I've been coming here for over 40 years and continue to enjoy the experience.",
          "The Royal Alberta Museum is not like any other museum. You start out seeing a full sized buffalo, then there is room full of animal scenes. I took a picture of the bear scene and posted and a friend commented on how brave I was to get that close to some bears. The scenes are",
          "We reached the museum around 1:00 pm and spent two hours there, but I would recommend arriving in the morning and touring half of the museum. After a lunch break in the cafe, take in the other half. We were able to complete a rush tour of the half we saw in our two hours. The",
          "I enjoyed the Museum, but definitely loved going through the old Lieutenant Governor's house. The guide there was very informative in a fun and casual way. It my just a friend and myself in there and he still took the time to walk us through and tell us fun stories. I was sad to",

          "Liked all of it, my 2 favorites were the Bugs and the taxidermy of the animals of Alberta. The work on making the habitat realistic and authentic is fantastic.",

          "Good place to take the grandkids, particularly if they have a special display and the cafeteria is Ok also.",
          "Having grown up in Edmonton, I had gone to the museum a lot with school. I went with my two sons and they clearly enjoyed the experience. It was the perfect rainy day activity. The exhibits are well laid out and captivated their interest. The insect section was a source of",
          "Spent 5 hours here on the at the beginning of July. Wonderful Aboriginal Peoples display. We took our time and read all available info. We certainly got our moneys worth and more. Highly recommend.",

          "This museum blew me away. I didn't expect alot but all the exhibits were thorough, entertaining and informative. It also covered a range of topics related to Alberta, which provides a nice feel for local history. A cheap, great experience.",
          "Anyone taking off to explore the natural world in Alberta should visit this museum first. I loved this museum the first time I visited it thirty years ago, but the updated version is even better. I took two eight-year-old boys there today, and they had a wonderful time. I only",
          "My family and I went to this WONDERFUL museum. On the First Floor, they showcase the wildlife of Alberta in such an interesting way. The animals are stuffed, which look so real. The glass is so clear, you would swear you could reach over and touch them. The First Floor",
          "Beyond interesting, lots of different things to see,the boys and I had a great afternoon.",
          "So lucky we live in this city! I love having such a fun place just a few minutes from my door. we visit at least once a month. I have an Experience Alberta Museum pass that allows me free admission to all Government of ALberta Museums for just $30/adult per year. Because of this",
          "When we lived in the city we went here once a month and now we visit with our son every time we're in Edmonton. The animal sections are really educational - from the Canadian species, fish and the insects and bugs upstairs. The special exhibits usually have a range of",

          "Fantastic - well worth a visit. The history of the native Canadian peoples and the development of the area is totally absorbing. Art work of amazing quality.",
          "This fine museum has something for everyone. The kids will love the bugs and spider exhibit. I loved the special Tapestry display of Moth Photos--it took my breath away! The natural history and Aboriginal exhibit were so well set up. You could learn from a 20 min walk",
          "A lot to see and had various changing displays. Went on a free day but evening if paying good value",
          "Located in a posh neighborhood, by historical buildings, the museum has a fine vista of the river valley. Soon the place will find new digs near the city's center in a revitalized area. The innards of the present building don't invite anything but a quick run-through before a",

          "The museum has some great dioramas but for me the best part is the exhibit of native art, clothing and history.",
          "Feels like a wonderful old museum with first rate exhibits. Terrific place on a hot summer day and lovely grounds.",
          "Sorry went there on way to many field trips and it hasn't changed for so many years.",

          "Although this museum will be moving to a more central down town area come see the richness of the displays it does offer.",
          "Great exhibits, especially the bug room. Historic building a must-see before the museum moves in the next couple years.",
          "The grounds are immaculate and the displays are really good. The bug room will creep you out. The paleantology and dinosaur displays will make you feel young again. The feature section and the animal displays are really well done. It's a great museum. I would have to say that",
          "So many different displays, featuring so many different topics. There are fairly elaborate displays for Native Canadians, brilliant animal displays, birds of prey, the bug room, some dinosaurs, and a very comprehensive display of gems, rocks, etc. I love coming here, as it",
          "This \"museum\" has a stuffed wildlife exhibit, a bugs and rocks exhibit, a Native exhibit, and a changeable exhibit. Nothing that really screams museum. Currently the changeable exhibit is on the deep ocean and I would be embarrassed to call it an exhibit. The highlight for all",

          "The museum isn't large by world standards, but it is top 5 in Canada. The building and landscaping has just begun a retrofit which will be stunning but it was also take forever to complete. The permanent galleries include 'the bugs' which is a corner of the museum lined with",
          "The museum has had some upgrades in the last few years and it is wonderful. The displays of all the different animals is my favourite section. They are so well done, set up in life like poses and surroundings. The other different areas such as the dinosaurs and the First",

          "Visited this museum for the first time today, and I like it better than the older version. The map layout is easy to understand. The architecture is modern, which is a nice contrast with the exhibits. Would like more written information about each thing they have on display, though.",

You will find an amazing collection and samples of Akbertan History here!! Must Visit place.",
          "Awesome exhibits, had a blast with the kids exploring different aspects of science. Will definitely be getting a Mammoth Pass next time we're through.",
          "This is one of the loveliest museums I ever visited. It has several sections _ extinct animals skeletons, aboriginals culture and alberta stones. I loved to see the mammoth and know about the aboriginals history.",
          "The new museum is pretty well spaced out, except for the bug gallery. The history on Residential Schools is also very small, and enclosed. It is pretty easy to do loops in the galleries without missing anything. Spent a solid three hours \u2026",
          "Nice building, glad they\u2019re educating the public on First Nations history. However, I just don\u2019t understand how Indigenous peoples get free admission, then they continue to follow me all around the museum, I didn\u2019t feel welcome with the security behind me every time I turn my shoulder",

          "Place was really nice. Definitely an upgrade from the old museum.  I do wish they had some sort of a food court.",
          "Support your museums! Top notch exhibits. Bug room is amazing. Kids area is nit as good as when it opened, but kids are rough on things.",
          "Had a lot of fun with the insect section, but the dinosaur skeletons were definately my favorites!",
          "Visited the museum for the first time at its new spot today and was impressed. What a beautiful new building!",
          "We love the Children's area at the RAM with our 2.5 year old twins so much that we bought a family membership and go roughly once a week. The other exhibits are also very well done!",
          "Went on family day, it was free that day. They did a good job at managing crowds. So many cool exhibits",
          "Prices have gone up, so its worth getting a pass if you have kids.  The kid play area is huge hit, and you can tell a lot of money was invested in the displays.  The whole place is really interactive.",
          "I had a great time debating history worh my grandson. We both were wiser after our debates.",
          "So BEAUTIFUL. I am weird like that. I love art and this place is so modern and gorgeous.",
          "What can I say about this place!?.. Hmm..\nHow about, It was a Exciting Delight to be inside and Experience and Learn!! Waaay more Family oriented and so spacious and airy. Lots of creative touches throughout the building, and and annual price is a GREAT price!! My Kids love it \ud83d\ude0d",
          "It has everthing you need to know about Edmonton. If you want to know about history, this is a good place to visit. The bug area was really cool.",
          "Nice big huge museum with awesome displays of Indigenous peoples! Worth anyone's time to check it out. Guarantee that you will need two visits at the minimum to come and check out the history of Alberta",
          "The museum is pretty typical, it's fun once but it's not very big so you can do most of it in one visit. Most of the exhibits are the same as the original museum, the only difference being their feature Exhibit area. The feature Vikings Exhibit was really good, and made a second trip worth it.",
          "Great and large kids section, kids love to play here. Museum could be bigger itself, doesn\u2019t have much histories there.",
          "Great place to visit with your kids! My son is 7 and enjoyed our visit alot.",
          "Lots of hands on activities, which are good for kids and adults. Well thought out inclusions like a sensory room and a great discovery room for kids. Also saw the travelling Vikings exhibit, which was interesting and fun. Regular exhibits \u2026",
          "Wow, I was impressed. The layout inside is a tiny bit confusing, but the displays are fantastic. Much upgraded form the old museum, but do miss the free parking. Lots of interesting cultural references and new displays about Alberta. We enjoyed. At three hours I still feel I could have stayed longer.",
          "Great value for families. Great little cafe. Lacking in all other aspects",
          "Very spacious and the cafe has the best hot chocolate! Of course the exhibits gave me a visual idea of how Albertans lived in the past.  I will surely comeback!\u263a\ufe0f",

          "Great place to go with the kids. The bug section is great for kids. The other exhibits are very informative and interactive. I would recommend going at of peak times so you don't have you queue at all the exhibits. \n\nThe lay out isn't very \u2026",
          "Honestly, I liked the old museum better.  This place is larger, which will allow them to have better feature exhibits, but the building itself is very \"vanilla\" lacks character.  Parking in the area is limited and expensive.\n\nThat said, \u2026",
          "Very well done, clean and nice presentation. The WWI exhibit is small but there's some  amazing stuff in there.\n It's worth it to just get the mamoth pass for the whole year as it's only the cost of two admission fees.",
          "Great exhibition but dont recommend attending on free days unless you have children.",
          "huge/big it's very nice there i've been there a few times before.",
          "Great place  went on free day. Great flow.\nI do feel everything got crammed into one place but it is well displayed. The Viking exhibit is awesome!",
          "Quite a good place CHEAP yearly pass (cost less then 2 visits) Cafe had decent if not a little overpriced food. Great kids area with learning and bugs.",
          "The absolutely best place to take your kids. The children's space is very well thought out and the activities changes often.",
          "Loved his place...so many eye catching exhibits..Vikings is always a great visit and very in depth..... so many things to see.. we expected to see this all in 2 hours.  Ah but 6 hours later we were still looking and wanting more time.. \u2026",
          "Love this place enough to get a year membership! The layout is interactive and easy to navigate with bright and well spaced out rooms enough for a busy crowd! Great coffee and drinks at the cafe and defiantly a must see in Edmonton.",
          "Very fun for free on Family Day. Lots of the same exhibits you remember from childhood field trips, along with new ones in a beautiful new building!",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Lots of light. Very educational and interesting. Everyone must visit. Friendly and professional staff.",
          "If you never went to a museum in your life, this museum might meet your expectations. If I take away the clean and well maintained premises, this entire museum is very unimpressive. There are displays full of unimpressive, comparatively \u2026",
          "Great place to take a child of any age. Great indoor play area with lots of tactile components, a little enclosed play zone and other learning toys. The bug exhibit is really great, but would be nice if it was bigger. Do not buy a coffee at the cafe if you want to go into the exhibits though. Drinks are not allowed!",
          "We visited the kids area and bug room. Kids had a blast. Lots of different things for them to do.",
          "Very elegantly laid out museum right in the heart of downtown Edmonton... This is an other step towards an emerging city of Edmonton, that values the importance of its past history.\nHad a chance to talk to Zac in human history section and Harish in the cafe area. Both left a lasting impression.",
          "Amazing collection of artifacts. The new building is incredible and a great family outing.",
          "Old museum and location was better. Moving the museum was a waste. Walking into the building  is not inspiring. The natural history area is still worth the visit.",
          "What an awesome museum!!  The exhibits are every bit as fascinating as I remembered from my childhood, but now with a much nice building to house them.  We spent just over two hours here and got through about 2/3 of the museum.  We look \u2026",

          "The exhibits are always well done and interesting. A season pass is barely twice the single admission and that way you can go for shorter visits and dont feel bad. The cafe has unique and tasty food choices.",
          "Underwhelming.  Unfortunately a lot of space used for nothing.  Too bad because this could have been good.",
          "Not as nice as orginal location. To much like telus kid center. No parking terrible location. Miss walking the grounds and river valley view of old location.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It was very large, clean, and very well set up. I highly recommend for people who enjoy learning new things.",
          "I love this museum. A lot to see!!! And for the smaller kids, the playground is amazing!",

          "Really amazing good artefacts very good people ,very sanitary , and also a very large building with many places inside insect Room dinosaur room the Crystal room and so maybe upcoming rooms",
          "Good learning experience about human and animal history. Clean children's play zone.",
          "Lots of cool stuff to look,and a good educational tool for learning about our history in Alberta, the good and The bad.",
          "Really like this place. My kids love going here to the kids zone.",
          "The new museum is worth every penny.  Buy the pass, you can never absorb it all in one visit.",
          "Wow fabulous place. I had visited here several times to saw some unique stuff. The items were well displayed and the atmosphere was positive. According to me its a great place for children, They may learn a lot  things. Must recommended place for children .",
          "Stopped in on our free day in Edmonton.  We are so glad we did.  A first rate natural history museum.  Their traveling special presentation was on The Vikings.  Loved the bugs!  First rate.",
          "Went specifically for the Vikings exhibit and was not disappointed in the least. The other exhibits were carried over from the old Museum with some upgrades. An enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours.",
          "The exhibits are amazing, there is enough detail in every piece that it you can spend all day reading about history. My only issue is the the price, 4 hours of parking and 2 tickets ends up being upwards of $60",
          "We made the mistake of going on family day (free admission day). The museum was so beautiful. The exhibits are fantastic. Great childrens area and bug exhibit. Very good and fairly priced food at the cafe too. The toasted butter raisin tart \u2026",
          "Excellent place to bring the family, lots of interesting things to do with kids and the cafe is excellent",
          "It\u2019s kinda like wandering through IKEA, you aren\u2019t sure if you saw that stuff in that room next door or if you are supposed to go over there and is that really the way out???  But that said, there are some fantastic displays of Vikings, \u2026",
          "The new museum is really well laid out, however I personally find some of the exhibits to be lacking. Too much emphasis was placed on the the human history of Alberta rather then the natural history of Alberta. \n\nThe dinosaur exhibit was \u2026",
          "It is an awesome place for people who like history and fun things to play around with.",
          "A fantastic way to spend the day! A very thoughtful and well laid out museum. Such a beautiful space too",
          "Great way to spend an afternoon. The front desk woman was no help what so eve..thats all i would change.",
          "A must see if you are visiting Edmonton. Exhibits encompass the human and natural history of the province. The gift shop is well curated and has locally made crafts and other goodies.",
          "Viking exhibit was awesome.\nKids area is a good place to tire the little ones\nFacilities are awesome, food was good.\nThey have places to store your stroller.\nIn the exhibits they have interactive stations, like touch screen tables to explain more detail and give young kids something to do when they don't want to read.",
          "For a Museum in Edmonton, it's pretty comprehensive and does justice to Alberta's history along with regular exhibitions on historic subjects ei. Vikings.\n\nThere are FREE days so search them up before going!!",
          "Mostly empty space. The actual visuals of a museum are small for the grand space it takes, making it feel crowded.",
          "I was very impressed with the exhibitions and the building. Historical portion well done and involving. Lots of space to relax and contemplate.",
          "Beautiful building.  Great natural history exhibit focusing on local natural history",
          "This is a world class museum with much more on display than you can possibly see in one visit. Superb and innovative displays. High levels of easy interaction and comfortable facilities. Even the restaurant/cafeteria is quite good and well \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful brand new museum. Definitely worth checking out. Currently has the Vikings exhibit and it is really fascinating. Tons of stuff to see and a kids area that is perfect. Children 6 and under are free so that's a nice thing. Overall I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it but I really genuinely did and plan on going again.",
          "The building alone is quite beautiful,  spacious and bright. I love the soft features like the stairs. Inside, there are several galleries and it's hard to find the time to see them all in one visit. So we'll go back. And I shall bring my \u2026",
          "It was great. I just wish the information plaques told you if a specimen was real or a cast. Also wish it told you where each specimen was found/the year and by who. Other than that it was a great experience!",
          "Amazing space.  Loved the Viking exhibit!  See it before it is gone! Did not get through much more that evening, so I need to have return visits!  I will be back.",
          "For the Edmonton region this is a great museum, the building is new and it seems like they are still trying to find their identity.  I enjoyed the tour that is offered every hour and can't wait to see how they will cycle new expositions.  The Viking expo was interesting.  No parking at the R.A.M.",
          "Travel back and learn the old ways in royal alberta museum. Spare  more time cause theres much to see in it and much to know in it.",
          "Much better than the old building, although most exhibits were so poorly lit I think I missed out on a lot of important details. All in all though, very impressive. Loved the bug room.",
          "I have been here 3 times and I will keep coming back to explore more. I loved it. It's entertaining and educating. The architecture is awesome. Must see! It's for family to enjoy. Finding time with family is the best and this is one place to get together and have talks about things around.",
          "I was welcome to the museum by a super nice gentleman who guided me and gave me a map to the museum. I entered the Vikings exposition and I was amazed by the Augmented Reality used within the exposition. I loved how well organized and planned is every hall.",
          "Viking exhibit was awesome. Hope you saw it. Give yourself lots of time as there so many interactive displays. Beautiful building! Do use transit though.",
          "Very impressed with the layout. So much to see that I ran out of time. Thank goodness my Christmas gift was a year long pass. The Viking exhibition was excellent, well laid out and a highlight to enjoy.",
          "I really enjoyed the natural history exhibits. I loved the gem room, and surprisingly liked to the bug room too. I like the architecture and design of the inside, but the outside of the building is really ugly. It was hard to find parking \u2026",
          "A great addition to the Edmonton landscape. The kids area by itself is brilliant. Food is decent and not overpriced",
          "Great place for kids and adults. The service provide coupled with knowledge and wisdom is unparalleled.",
          "Love it.  Lots of really cool things to learn about here.\nAlso the food here is better than I would've expected, the mushroom soup in particular is fantastic, definitely recommend",
          "The exhibits are done really well!! Lots to see and learn about. Staff are very helpful, the cafe's food is great!!",
          "Such a cool place to go and check out, and at a great price point too. The variety of displays, and level of interactive material was quite impressive. Also the insect display was mind-blowing, definitely get to see some specimens we would never encounter around Alberta",
          "Pricing based on race is a disgusting thing to see in this country. Shame because the exhibits are all so great and engaging, but I can't in good conscious recommend going to a place that has such fundamentally racist policies.",
          "Had an amazing time, there was lots to do for both my 5 year old and 2 year old. We bought the year pass and have visited every month since buying it.",
          "I visited the museum with my son as his first trip out! We had a great time, the exhibits were wonderful, it was a great atmosphere for all of us, we were able to go through at our own pace, and the whole building was very easily accessible \u2026",
          "This place has something for everyone and is very reasonably priced! My kids love the bugs, minerals, dinosaurs and play area in particular \ud83d\ude42",
          "Something for all ages! Our boy loved the kids and bug areas",
          "Loved the viking exhibit, bug exhibit, pretty much everything. But I really appreciated the kids area. It was amazing! And had a lovely little under 3 area that my little one loved!",
          "Very underwhelming. Most exhibits were very minimalistic against white walls. A very gallery feel. No wow factor at all. 50% of the museum was indigenous based and felt political. I watched a video in the museum that was about how Canada \u2026",
          "This Museum was capitivating. They also let my friend in free because she pushed me around in a wheelchair.  We went during the Viking exhibit and any time you can immerse yourself into ancient culture and learn about who were we as a \u2026",
          "Really good exhibits. I was pleasantly surprised",
          "Took my 4 year old here, and we easily spent 4 hours having the best time! It was awesome! Prices are decent (kids 6 and under are free), exhibits are interesting, and there's lots of cool interactive portions. Food in the cafe was \u2026",
          "Lots of exhibits and plenty to see. The museum is chock full of fascinating and interesting pieces of history and information. Be sure to leave plenty of time though if you want to take it all in, there is tons to read and many interactive \u2026",
          "So interesting! Lots of diversity in the exhibits, kids really got excited about the nature dioramas, tree rings, rocks and minerals and gems.",
          "New location right downtown.  Lots of paid parking in above and below ground areas.  The museum is very well layed out and is very interactive.  Accessible to all and all ages will find it very good.   The Viking experience was a awesome",
          "Love it! Such a fun way to spend your day",
          "We love it here! Awesome rainy day activity with kids. Their toddler area is amazing and we are excited to go back. Would highly recommend buying an annual pass as it pays for itself after 2 visits.",
          "This was a great experience for me. This was my first time to go there and I was really amazed by this place. Will definer go there again.",
          "Great Museum however I enjoyed Glenbow Aboriginal exhibit more.",
          "Took my son's beaver scout colony. They all enjoyed it greatly.",
          "Great children's area. Staff were friendly and informative. Lots of hands on displays.",
          "Enjoyed a lot. It was even fun for my niece, especially the Children's Gallery. Spaces are well organised, so its easier to navigate. Washrooms were placed at every corners for convinence. Open and high lobby with a glider and birds gives a very realistic touch. Every gallery tells its own story. Time well spent, Awesome.",
          "Great museum. Beautiful natural history section.",
          "First visit to the new RAM.\nVikings exhibit was top of the list. It was mostly from Norway,  Sweden and Denmark. Authentic artifacts of all kinds with many interactive stations.\nWell worth a visit. I must return a few times to to see everything else in other galleries.",
          "Great staff, clean, bright. Inexpensive for a family too.",
          "The museum is really great!! So much to see. Really impressive and definitely worth the price of admission.",
          "Great kids area. Loved the bug exhibit. Needs more handicapped parking though.",
          "Beautiful museum. The rocks in the natural history section were especially neat! A great place for a family day or a date!",
          "Great exhibit for all ages, very engaging. Parking is terrible though, overpriced, not easily accessible and overcrowded.",
          "Awesome.  We really enjoyed it,my kids were so happy. We had a great time, the exhibits were so wonderful. It is very impressive and interactive.  Kids really enjoyed the bug gallery and children gallery.  The place is very easily accessible.",
          "Beautiful museum located in the heart of downtown Edmonton. Lots of interesting artifacts. I would have given a 5 star rating, but the woman in front of the children's gallery entrance was a little rude.",
          "I'm sorry but this place is inferior to the museum that preceded it. There are virtually no artifacts or art, only the insectorium was better then that of the previous location. Don't advertise Vikings on your billboards if you only have one viking artifact.",
          "wonderful!! the peacock mantis shrimp was very shy but also very pretty in the light",
          "An absolute splendid visit, can't wait to visit again.  So much to learn, so little time.  Thank you for offering free entrance for military and families by the way.  Much appreciated!!",
          "Wonderful place to visit - have bought myself a seniors annual pass and a family pass for my son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren so we can visit lots.",
          "This is a great place to explore. I only went one day but you could easily spend a few days checking out the exhibits. Wonderful children's play area. This is a family friendly spot.",
          "The new museum sports a fancy new design. It feels very modern and the exhibits are impressive, immersive and interactive. I do feel that the old building carried a certain majesty in its stone construction that hasn't translated to the new \u2026",
          "I was trying to find out how much admission to the museum was on a Monday and this is what I saw\n \nTues-Mon                 10am-5pm\nMon                            closed\n\nConsidering the municipal tax that we pay, I'd think they'd have \u2026",
          "Amazing how big it is and was shocked to see live animals insidr",
          "Beautiful new facility for Alberta's museum.  Extensive displays at a reasonable price.",
          "Took the granddaughter and she just loved it, especially the dionsours and the bug exhibit.",
          "The museum is awesome, but slightly underwhelming. For a building this size, I expected more exhibits. The permanent displays are well thought out, and can be visited a couple of times before you feel like you've seen everything.",
          "Cool place. Had Christmas party here.  Good venue.",
          "Really cool play area for toddlers - good for repeat visits. I really loved the Natural History area, especially the rock selection (sooo cool!). Definitely worth getting the year pass to come back 2+ times.",
          "I had a lot of fun at the RAM, very educational and the gift store is reasonably priced. Next year I plan on getting a pass.",
          "The kids gallery is fantastic! We spend most of our time there. We also enjoyed the Viking Exhibit. The other exhibits are always fun too. Typically do one gallery and then the kids one. Very clean. The volunteers/employees are friendly.",
          "I specifically visited the Museum to see the Viking Exhibition. It was extremely interesting with a lot of detail to ships, life on sea, land, faith, conquests, social structure and interactive sections. Personnel were extremely forthcoming \u2026",
          "RAM is a great place to visit.  One visit is not sufficient if you are really interested in the exhibits. There is so much to see and learn.  It's in a new location and building. This Museum is located in downtown Edmonton. The exhibits are \u2026",
          "Great facility. Nice and bright, especially on cold winter days.",
          "Free access too the Manatoo stone. Wonderful.",
          "excellent exhibits, parking is at a premium. best to use public transit.",
          "The only parking available is private parking. The closest parking is $6/hour even during weekends. Will save the visit for summer.",
          "Fantastic exhibition of Albertan animals. The Children's gallery is full of fun.",
          "What a good experience! This location is quite large, with a good variety of things to see in each different section. The admission price is reasonable. Planned to be there an hour or two and spent the whole afternoon!",
          "The Viking exhibit was really great! A very well designed and interesting museum. A must see in Edmonton! Veterans/Military get in free too! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6",
          "Love that they have a children's section. My son loved it",
          "This place is so cool! Five star experience from the moment I walked in. The staff here are amazing and very helpful. They know a lot about the displays. The only downside was I was expecting it to be bigger with more artifacts. It's definitely worth checking out",
          "So big. There was lots to see but it definitely was super busy. Only cause it was free admission day",
          "Very cool viking exhibit while I was there, the rest of the museum was great as well",
          "This place is really cool, I love the bug room and how varied everything was, so many bugs! I came back for the viking exhibit and it was very interesting, the dress up part was cool, and the regular exhibits had that same sort of draw, \u2026",
          "The museum is very modern and open with lots of natural light. The lobby spaces are quiet even with plenty of people in them. The feature exhibit space could use better ventilation, it's quit stuffy inside. My only complaint is that the \u2026",
          "Amazing museum. The kids area was especially great, much better if you have kids and they need to burn some energy. The indigenous components of the museum were great and the fact that the museum is free for indigenous people is also \u2026",
          "It was a very fun and exciting experience.  a fabulous place for both adults and children.  Thank you very much to everyone who contributed.",
          "Fantastic facility. Displays are excellent. Something for everyone.",
          "This is an extensive facility.   The Manitou Asin\u00eey is a reflective and well done space. I enjoyed learning about all the divers diverse history of the area in the Human History Hall.",
          "Excellent area for kids to freely explore. Exhibits are spacious and vary widely.",
          "Very nice. Kids found enough to keep themselves interested. Didn't know that the feature exhibit was not open so that was a little disappointing. Probably won't go back for a while unless a feature exhibit that really excites me comes in. \u2026",
          "Extremely polite and helpful staff. Not to expensive. All and all a great great outing for a few hours",
          "Went to the museum with the wife on a chilly day, it was the perfect trip for such a day. 20 dollars per adult, they offer family packages. Due to other commitments we could only stay for 2 hours. Meaning we only had time to see one \u2026",
          "The Vikings was a good display. I enjoyed learning about their history, iron ore, jewelery and ships and art",
          "Visited once for the Vikings travelling exhibit, and a second time the human history section (was impressed by the videos of indigenous people using recreated old weapons and making pemmican). Only had enough energy and time to do a quick \u2026",
          "Cute place. Love my girlfriend",
          "I love how that I can just walk in. I am First Nations and I can just walk into the Royal Alberta  Museum I think it's fantastic and I feel absolutely wonderful that I can do such . There are no words to explain how I feel just real good you know in a good way. Hiy Hiy \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Amazing upgrade from the old location. Even if you don't have kids, I encourage people to check out the 'kids' area. The museum is definitely a multi-trip kinda thing, so much to see and do. The Viking exhibit was really cool, there was \u2026",

          "Interactive displays and well designed. Viking displays are very cool, especially the one showing the vast size of the boat they used. Different displays showing different era's, including human history which shows some full scale models of dinosaurs! Well worth the $19 per person entrance fee!",
          "Great for children, babies, toddlers, adults and everyone else! Great value and changes happen frequently! This place is awesome, and has a great cafe with homemade donuts!",
          "Went with the family. Exhibits were a nice balance of informative and interactive, the latter of which kept the kids occupied. When they had energy to burn they went to the children's section where there were plenty of toys for them. The \u2026",
          "My kids loved the play area. Can\u2019t emphasize it enough, worth the admission just for that. The natural history has some interactive touch screen stations to help kids (and adults) understand the topics discussed",
          "It was very  nice place  to even  the food there was great",
          "Best place for the children as well as youngsters to lean about new things. The place was neat and clean. All stuff was properly placed. overall nice place",
          "Went to visit with a friend and to see the Viking exhibit. We spent longer than we expected and I personally could have stayed. Lots to look at as well as lots of information to read. I especially enjoyed the bug exhibit.",
          "Our family has a year Mammoth pass... for the price of admission twice it pays for itself. If you have kids it's a no brainer!",
          "Wonderful museum to go to. Lots to see and learn. They had a cool viking exhibit during my visit which was quite fascinating with a few interactive displays. However my favorite part was the bug exibit however not a good fit for those who \u2026",

          "Really nice place with different sections about history of Alberta. Worth a visit.",
          "Great exhibits, particularly love the natural and human history. Prices are standard for a museum. Excited to see what exhibits will cycle through it",
          "Smaller than I expected. They combined a bunch of the old exhibits so theres really only 4 galleries. Overall nice space with a decent flow through the galleries. Just wish there were more galleries.",
          "Great place to visit,  and learn new things.",
          "This was my first time to this venue. It was so cool to see everything from our past.\nThe viking exhibit was in while I was there. It was magnificent to see all the relics preserved so beautifully. It looks like it took hours to get looking just right.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours. They have a whole area for kids to play, and discover with a rotating theme in the back area. There is a huge selection of bugs and snakes and I won't go back there but if you like that sort of thing it's \u2026",
          "The new museum is so wonderful! I really appreciate all the hard work they put into having a more in depth look at Alberta's long history, including the people who were here long before any European explorers. The bug section had so many amazing specimens. I can't recommend it enough!",
          "Amazing experience seeing preservation of artifacts and other learning stuff. The history of the vikings and Christianity was indeed great and interesting. I will visit again with my family",
          "Great family activity. Takes a few hours to really see everything.",

          "Awesome place to check out! So many fascinating exhibits and it really takes you back to Alberta\u2019s past. I would recommend setting aside at least 4-5 hours to come here to fully absorb all the information presented. Also, offering free \u2026",

          "Its so different from the old one but we really enjoyed it!",
          "I just went here on a date and it was great. The best parts were the bug exhibit and the natural history wing. I was blown away by the amount and quality of mineral specimens on display in the natural history wing. Wish there was more information about each mineral but that's probably just me :P",

          "We visited the museum on June 22, 2019. \nReally impressed by the design of the building, and very friendly staff. \nThe displays are very informative and well presented. \nSpecial mention for the Viking exhibit which is simply amazing.",
          "Great family time! Loved all the exhibits, great and fresh new look to the museum. We all had so much fun. The Mammoth Family pass is really reasonable, totally worth it, now we can go all year. Can't wait to see the Viking exhibit in April.",
          "The new space is fantastic. Open and inviting, with tons of great exhibits and show pieces. Plenty of mixed media and interactivity as well. Far too much to see in a single day. Fortunately the Mammoth Pass is an absolute steal.",
          "Neat experience lot's to see.",
          "This is a \"must see\" if you're at all interested in museums. Currently the Vikings exhibit is here on loan from Denmark, until October 20th, 2019. Fantastic exposition, educational, interactive, you'll want to see this. The galleries are well thought out.  The RAM should definitely make your visit list when in Edmonton.",
          "Great set up, and Lots of interesting things to see but I miss the old museum.",
          "Wish they could keep Thursdays open late or even adult nights like muttart. I go atleast 2 times a week! So much to learn !",

          "I love the revamp to the museum they've done! The mammoth pass is well worth the extra cost, as there is more than enough here to justify several visits. The exhibits feature a good mix of classical plaques, videos, and interactive \u2026",
          "It's a Museum, has a whole kid friendly section and interesting exhibits. Nothing to write home about but worth a visit.",
          "Lots of really fun things for families . Bug exhibit was awesome",
          "Wow, I have visited the old RAM many times and was looking forward to the opening of the new location. I highly recommend this museum and really enjoyed the rock and gem exhibits and the bugs. It was nice to see the dioramas that I had \u2026",
          "Amazing! The new museum is great! Loved the flow of the main exhibit. Especially Loved the fashion  portion. Very convenient location!",
          "Haven't fully explored it yet. If the Children's Gallery is an indication, RAM will be amazing. Bonus tip: regular admission is $19; Mammoth Pass (all year pass) is $35! Essentially, no out-of-pocket on third use, onwards :-)",
          "Just went for the shop inside and the cafe! It's super cute and I got a mug and bannock!",
          "We were there with small children so we didn't see all of it. What we did see was amazing and incredibly beautiful. The interactive displays were fun-filled 4 children and adults alike while being educational as well. But the hit of the day \u2026",
          "I love the building. I love the exhibits. \n\nThe vikings exhibit was particularly interesting with the integration of technology such as Augmented Reality to be able to fully realize the shape and size of such vessels they used to travel the oceans.",
          "The Viking exhibit was amazing! My boyfriend and I spent almost an hour and a half in there! The other exhibits were okay compared to the Viking. Would come back for the special exhibits.",
          "Decent visit. Exhibits were well thought out. Felt like they needed more - didn't really add much since they moved from their old location.",
          "Good coffee and donuts here, in addition to old stuff. Annual membership is very affordable if you plan on going more than once.",
          "World class facility! Children's area is great, we could spend all day there. Exhibits are fantastic, tons of different variety, from bugs and rocks to clothes to fossils! Big sprawling facility, very welcoming, can't wait to keep coming \u2026",
          "This museum is huge. I had the opportunity of going to three sections: natural history, Alberta and the bug section. I highly recommend going to the museum. One of the top museums I have been on. Check the pictures out. It gives you an idea what it looks like.",
          "I feel the old museum featured the artifacts, and less the building. The new building, although nice was very spread out.\nThe wild animal exhibit could have had some amazing techno features, the clouds could have appeared to move across the \u2026",
          "Really nice layout with super cool exhibits. It's great to just walk around looking at everything to see what's there, or make a day trip out of an exhibit to stop and read everything to see how much you can learn.  The building is \u2026",
          "Went for a two hour visit today with family. Mostly to see Viking exhibit before it's gone.  Was able to see everything without alot of other people being in the way ona Thursday from noon till 230pm",
          "A gem of a museum the capital city deserves. The old Royal Alberta Museum (RAM) was a relic of the past. The new RAM is truly a gem, something special for everyone that adds further vibrancy to the west end of downtown. \n\nThe main level \u2026",
          "This museum is a big upgrade from the previous building where it was housed. It's attractive and the staff was efficient. The human history gallery did a great job of portraying the changing face of Alberta. The bug room was both creepy and fascinating. They have a wide variety of live bugs from the world over. A great museum.",
          "Haven't been since I was 12  years old and in the old building. It was a great afternoon with lots to see and learn about.",
          "Amazing insight into Canadian History.",
          "Decent place best to try and go when it\u2019s not busy or if you have a baby to wear them as people aren\u2019t that mindful of people walking around with strollers... some of the displays are along a narrow pathway and so it can get congested",
          "Quite disappointed with some of the displays that make noise, for the 'kids'. The sound was so loud and so disturbing that we made a complaint to one of the staff and she just kind of laughed and said all the kids love playing with those \u2026",
          "I liked it it was interesting. The one thing that I didn't like was in the live insect room there were a lot of dead insects in there glass enclosures.",
          "The Viking exhibit was great. Even our little boys enjoyed it! Great interactive displays for everyone to enjoy and lots of interesting information for the adults.",
          "Great museum with amazing exhibits! Definitely a place to check out :) Some pointers though... They need their own parking. Second, the new Vikings exhibit room was REALLY warm and dark whereas the children's exhibit room had the ac turned \u2026",
          "I wish I could give 4.5 stars... It's very, very good, but not quite perfect. \nIt's a beautiful new building, and very well laid out. I spent most of 3.5 hours in the Human History gallery. There is a significant focus on Indigenous \u2026",
          "Awesome place to visit. Don't miss it when you come to Edmonton.",
          "This is the place to go. Histoy calls. Dinos, and Native wonders, and rocks and gems, the bug room and a children's area; Alberta history.  The annual passes are really affordable,  busses stop right outside the door, The gift shop  has \u2026",
          "The annual pass is fantastic price and a great way to kill time with psychotic toddlers",
          "I hosted an event at the cafe in the RAM and it went very smoothly. It was average priced with way above average food. Drink tickets worked not only for wine, but pop as weak. The staff were extremely accommodating and thoughtful (they even \u2026",
          "get the mammoth pass if you live in Edmonton, we usually go every couple of months very early to spend time in the otherwise crowded areas, the place is really good and the coffe shop is surprisingly good and not that expensive, with the \u2026",
          "Nice exhibits and nice new building.",
          "This was my first time here and it was fantastic. The food was delicious and good value for money. Servers were friendly and efficient and I also enjoyed being around so many French speakers.",
          "The yearly adult or family pass is a great deal. The cafe is lovely; meeting rooms are bright and spacious. The gift shop carries lots of local products which is very, very nice to see.",
          "It was awesome definitely would go again",
          "The exhibits are well presented and informative. I was underwhelmed by the Viking exhibit. From all the promotion , I expected a larger, more stimulating experience.",
          "A lot of seeing history and discovering new insects",
          "If you live in Edmonton, worth buying the year pass. So much to see, well designed exhibits and the food in the cafe was decent.",
          "Really like the new building for the museum.",
          "Great museum. The kids area has lots of stuff to entertain everyone, no matter the age. One downside is that the men's bathroom has no change table.\n\nTheir mineral section is fantastic, and makes up just one part of a really good natural \u2026",
          "Check this place if you ever come to edmonton!\n\nSupporting history and the advancement of humans generally.",
          "Amazing, I have been on 3 grade 6 school trips and 2 were to the old museum, 1st trip to the newly opened RAM and it blew my socks off!! Well worth the trip into the heart of the city for a wander through the museum & time.",
          "Very educational experience. Amazing!!",
          "Awesome place to go with your friends and family. All the stuff was very informative and unique. The place was quite decent and cozy.",
          "This new facility is absolutely awesome.   They were able to bring some of the dioramas from the old building which was neat to see.\nExcellent experience!",
          "Family membership appears to be good value. The kids really enjoyed the bug room and the children's area. Quite busy, but they seemed to manage the crowds quite well. The Alberta History and the Natural History areas had lots of displays and really good interesting descriptions. Even kids under 7 remained engaged.",
          "The new museum far outshines the old. They have a top notch kids section full of some of the latest interactive technology and activities. Also included are an impressive bug display with some quite rare insects, a large human history \u2026",
          "Great experience. The Viking exhibit was very well laid out and very interesting. Overall we had a good experience, however the human history section wasn't as good as the rest of the museum.",
          "A wonderful new arrangement to the Royal Museum. The displays are arranged so many can see at once. Crowds are not as much of a concern like in the old museum.\nThe only concern is the parking issue. Your best bet is to use the \u0139RT at Churchill Station.",
          "Went on a quieter weekday so much more enjoyable. Excellent setup, very interactive. Essentially engaging for the whole family. To read and enjoy everything, plan on 5 hours.\nI look forward to the Viking exhibit in April.",
          "Fun things to do with kids, great couple of hours!",
          "Great place. Kid friendly.",
          "Fantastic Museum!  My 4 year old LOVES IT!  there are plenty of interactive stations and so much interesting displays.  From kids to all ages this place will have you in awe of Nature and our history has to offer.  A must visit.",
          "Awesome fun for your family and kids on a day off.",
          "We went early and got to the cafe before the lunch rush. The exhibits are fantastic and easy to navigate. Took our 3 year old and he loved it. I would definitely go again. The food is delicious as well as priced for quality and portions. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to be educated and entertained.",
          "Great displays. Well laid out, with succinct descriptions. The kids gallery looks great for people several decades younger than me.",
          "RAM is a beautiful, modern museum that represents Alberta well. Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours inside because it is absolutely MASSIVE and full of great artifacts. Vast majority of the exhibits are interactive and very \u2026",
          "Its clean, beautiful and well organized. They open by 10am and I was there by 10.17am  single entry is $19 for adults but you can pay $35 for year round entry and $70 for family.\n.\nIt's a good destination for family and student group visits.",
          "This place is great for both adults and children.   It is both educational and fun.  A great way to spend a rainy summer day with the kids!!",
          "Nice, beautiful and clean museum. I went to the Viking exhibition and it was amazing, very interactive and detailed. The RAM\u2019s Human History Hall \u201cI am from Here\u201d exhibition is specially beautiful.",
          "Nice new space.  The exhibits are well done.  The kids area is nice.",
          "Having attended the old Alberta Museum in comparison this new facility is simply marvelous. The architectural design of the building to the very inspiring exhibits. Was there for 4 hours and still didn't get a chance to explore the entire \u2026",
          "I've been waiting for the new museum to open for years now and it didn't disappoint! The building and displays are beautiful. I think the parts that were the most impressive were the parts designed for the younger audience. The bug gallery and kids interactive play area were both awesome! This is an awesome afternoon family adventure",
          "A lot of interesting things to check out. I loved the bug section!",
          "Fantastic. The new exhibits are outstanding and so is the building. Great kids area and the cafeteria food was very good.",
          "The quality of the exhibits were great, but I wish there were more!",
          "The facility is very clean and beautiful. So much content to view you'll probably want to get an annual pass so you can go back and continue where you left off. We saw the Vikings feature and learned a lot!",
          "Was a good museum bus it was a little small. It was not a interactive exhibits except for the Vikings special exhibit and the children's area. Over all a good simple museum",
          "Take a full day to check this out, do not expect to be in and out in a couple hours unless you are just going to take selfies and leave",
          "Come here often with my daughter. We're never dissapointed. Always clean and engaging",
          "Was amazing. I was lucky to be able to tour in advance of the opening with CBC Mark about town. It is a great balance of natural history and local history.",
          "Love the museum. The exhibits are so cool. Very interactive. And the cafe is awesome too. Reasonably priced and delicious.",
          "Havnt updated the exhibits since i was kid. Strange layout to the new building- lots of wasted space and you have to backtrack through some of the exhibits to get out because they didnt design a loop. Only recommended if there is a good travelling exhibit.",
          "This will not be a good review as I chose to go on the busiest day of the year. This is totally not the establishments fault. I will need to revisit on a \"regular\" day to truly experience this place. Until then I can only give 2 stars. I \u2026",
          "Great exhibits, cafe has wonderful food at reasonable prices",
          "A very nice and interesting place.\nI can learn more about Edmonton and Canada's history.\nYou can learn about geology, archeology and biology too.",
          "Great place to visit, kids love the kid zone and the big exhibit, Viking exhibit was well done",
          "Finally saw the new museum. Not bad. It wasn't as big as I thought. A number of old exhibits were not included and some exhibits were made smaller. Two were expanded which was nice. In the end it is about the same size as the old museum, but a little harder to navigate.",
          "If you haven't been you may want to go especially right now with the Vikings exhibit. The National Museum in Denmark lent the entire collection of artifacts. The ships, weapons, Royal jewelry coins, and historical information dating back \u2026",
          "Very enjoyable, bug exhibit is very good. Thought there would be more stuff. Maybe more exhibits will be added in the future.",
          "Very affordable and a great way to spend a rainy sunday. Lots of exhibits",
          "Love love love the kids gallery. So much fun for your littles. The mammoth pass is 100% worth it!!",
          "Great place to spend at least half a day. The second floor natural history section is the best part. It is just one block away from Chinatown, so food is not to far away if you need more energy.",
          "Exhibits are nice, good assortment of things to check out. If you are contemplating coming here and your kids can be a little crazy at times (I have 4 boys) this may not be the best place for you to go. Security is all over and on the hunt \u2026",
          "An excellent museum and public space.  The outside is unassuming, but once inside the space is modern and at the same time timeless.  The exhibits are appropriate and we'll considered.  I know some have made complaints about the facility \u2026",
          "The new building is beautiful. By far my favourite exhibit is the Natural History part. It's very well done and they've brought out a ton of their fossil collections and used updated technology to explain a lot of concepts. They've only \u2026",
          "Interesting architecture full of terrific exhibits.",
          "Much nicer than the old one. The bug world was great for our 5 year old and the kids area was great too.  I recommend getting your admission on line as then you skip the line up altogether. Great time took us about 3 hours with the 5 year old. 1 hour in the play area.",
          "Exhibits are done and space is nicely utilized. On par with International museums I have visited in major cites.",
          "Love the new facility, world class.  Great galleries very well thought out.  The caf\u00e9 has very good food at good prices.  Loved the french fries.  The shop has an amazing amount of Alberta made items.  They carry Medalta pottery.  A wonderful place to take visitors, family or yourself again and again.",
          "The newly renovated museum has something for everyone. Spacious with a minimalistic design, there are accessible washrooms, a cafe, gift shop, and multiple exhibits. There is a children's gallery where kids of all ages can explore the hands \u2026",
          "Truly an immersive experience! Highly recommend",
          "Friendly and informative staff. Great layout and interactive  displays. Kid friendly.",
          "Great place! Interactive for kids,good walks down memory lane for us older ones",
          "Wow from the new digs to the Viking ship and free senior day one of the best visits for your money in Edmonton.  Kids will love the bug exhibit",
          "Such a great expansion of the original museum in so many ways. Don't plan to take it all in with one visit. Get the Mammoth pass, and make lots of short visits throughout the year.",
          "The new RAM location is beautiful and does an excellent job of integrating new exhibits and pieces with the hint of nostalgia from the old museum. Some of the signage could be improved and sometimes it is hard to tell where to go next to \u2026",
          "First time here and would definitely come back!",
          "Wear comfortable shoes.. needs more areas to sit down to recuperate",
          "Very friendly staffs, kids play area is excellent. My kids had a fun time there. Few sections are not open yet. There are not a lot of collections. I personally expected more collections. There is one more section yet to be started. But my \u2026",
          "A fantastic place where the food taste we're outstanding. You can enjoy your whole day without getting bore for a single moment.",
          "Such a great museum, there is a huge kids area that is worth the visit alone. Very impressed with the cafeteria everything is fresh made from Alberta sources and very tasty. The house made donuts are some of the best I have had in Edmonton.",
          "Nice new building and we'll layed out. Mammoth represents great value for money. Viking display first rate.",
          "While I only had 3 hours to explore the museum, and therefore wasn't able to see everything, I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the amount of fascinating exhibits in the natural history gallery alone. I spent the entire 3 hours there \u2026",
          "Very cool place. Kids love the Children's gallery, they could spend the whole day there.",
          "This museum is a great way to spend a cold winter day! We were there for over 3 hours looking through the exhibits. We went on a holiday so it was extremely busy and had to wait in line for a while. I recommend buying your pass online and \u2026",
          "Cool bugs. Neat looking play place for kids (mammoth pass which is x2 the cost of regular admissions for a year?) might be good for home makers with kids.",
          "Having loved the old Royal Alberta Museum, I was concerned that the new one would measure up. It far surpasses the old. The exhibits have been modernized in a good way. The displays are aesthetically pleasing, informative, and interesting. \u2026",
          "There is so much to see and read you ought to wear comfortable shoes and pace yourself. The mammoth pass is worth the price to come back to see it all.",
          "Very nice museum will be going back. Many different things to see. Room for kids to play bug room.",
          "Our first time at the new museum. so mu h to see. Couldn't see it all at once. We'll be back. And the cafe menu... bonus!",
          "Bought a year pass as this makes sense for the price and the fact that 3 hours didn't even come close to covering everything there.  The kids area is really cool... You will have to pay attention to understand what is being taught through play here. Very clever!  The cafe has good coffee and seams reasonably priced as well.",
          "I came here with my girlfriend and we had a great time! there is so much to see here, so make sure that you budget at least 3 hours for yourself to get through it and enjoy it. I thoroughly enjoyed the human history exhibit as it shows all \u2026",
          "Honestly, I was disappointed with the new museum. The old location was on beautiful, scenic grounds (but also prime real estate, so I'm sure developers are salivating) with ample free parking (oops, can't make money off that). The new \u2026",
          "Would be awesome to see some exciting exhibitions here.",
          "The Viking Exhibition was extremely interesting to watch. A fun place to go. You can also visit Chinatown if want to eat something on you visit.",
          "Beautifully remodeled and quite an interactive form of entertainment. Don't hesitate to bring the kids! Even though the exhibition room was not occupied during my visit, the museum is exactly how it should be. I enjoyed the story behind the beaver pelts and the live bugs the most!",
          "Just a great place one of the best museums",
          "I'm so happy with the new museum! I have great memories of bringing my son to the old location just after we moved to Edmonton, and the new RAM is even better. The bug room is absolutely awesome, plus there's a whole space set aside for younger kids. Check out the behind-the-scenes exhibits too!",
          "The museum has a great layout. Lots of places to sit. The info cards are informative, but not overwhelming. The cafe is a little bit small bit they seemed pretty efficient, and the food was great. Overall a great experience. Parking is a little bit expensive since it is downtown, but that is the only drawback.",
          "Discovered that my son has a real passion for history here. We brought him mainly for the bugs but he was blown away by the viking exhibition and the old swords.",
          "Exhibits were awesome, The Vikings exhibit was very well put together and can go through the whole museum in four hours. A little pricey,  but worth it to see some unique history.",
          "I went to the museum and loved it. I have been to museums all over the world and am glad to have such a beautiful, accessible space right down town.\n\nThe human history exhibit is an awesome telling of human's history in Alberta. Great to \u2026",
          "You can find there the Viking's vestige and all prehistoric animals living long time ago in Canada. It is instructive to kids and historians.",
          "Amazing, must see if you are in town!",
          "The bugs are disgusting! The food was great.  I also really  enjoyed the viking exhibit.",
          "A phenomenal upgrade of the old location. Bright and beautiful with a refocused emphasis on Alberta, it's fun for the whole family and always worth the visit",
          "We love the new play area for the kids!",
          "Awesome experience. Loved the Viking exhibit.",
          "It has a lot of potential.\nHow they use and develop the museum over time could earn it one more star.",
          "Great Museum. Lots to do and see for all ages! The Vikings exhibition is tremendous.",
          "It was great field trip with the school",
          "Beautiful Museum and thoughtfully laid out",
          "Modern upgrade to the old museum.  The natural history section, and in particular, the geology sections were very interesting.  The main floor has a bug exhibit that should be fun for children, but I'm not a fan of bugs.   The Alberta \u2026",
          "Awesome museum! Kids area and feature gallery are always a hit, with the constant exhibits. We go regularly and never seem to see everything! Parking is poor so prepare to walk or take the LRT!",
          "Went for the Viking display. Pretty cool. Got to see all the other displays also. I'd recommend this to others looking for a way to spend a day off",
          "Honestly a bit disappointing for the price of admission (~$20 per adult) and the cost associated with the renovation/move. The architecture of the building is nice and very wide open. The kids area is fun and well done but besides that, \u2026",
          "Beautiful building with lots of open space and natural light....great interactive displays",
          "This place is huge. Divided into different veiwings..Parking can be a no go in downtown Edmonton. Took the LRT down town..eazy breezy..took us straight to the indoor walkway that led us to the Museum. Great way to spend a day.",
          "What a great time there love it",
          "The RAM is so amazing! It's beautiful and huge. Make sure to give yourself lots of time for your visit, or purchase the two-day ticket.",
          "Amazing place.Totally worths a visit",
          "The kids' areas are the best!",
          "Such a great time! Went for a 1 year old birthday party and my son had an amazing time in the infant area.  Purchased a 1 year pass to check out the rest of the museum.  The only downfall is that there isn't much parking around the area (no underground parking either) - in the summer I wouldn't mind the stroll but it was very cold today.",
          "A little hard to find parking, so best to go with public transit or on bike. Beautiful exhibits and lots of interactive activities. Love the aquariums.",
          "Kids area is especially worth checking out",
          "Lots to see! Impossible to see it all in one visit. The Vikings display and production was extensive and enjoyable. I want to frequently.",
          "Alright place to bring your kids for the play area, but less than mediocre as a museum. More rocks and beads than unique exhibits. Lots of empty space.\n\nEdit: Other reviewers use the word \"world-class\" in their description. Are you easily \u2026",
          "Had a good time. Unfortunately the discounts for aboriginal, military, and others aren't stated on the website so we had bought tickets online to find out after that we were entitled to discounts. Fortunately we've been told our refund should be processed in 48 hrs! So they were very helpful after the fact!",
          "I really enjoyed this place, it was very educational and perfect for family outings!",
          "Nice building and lots of displays.  We were glad of all the seating in the Human museum.  The viking feature was awesome.",
          "I love the modern interactiveness of the exhibits. It is a very open concept design that is refreshing. The Viking exhibit was amazing.",
          "Truly appalling how huge this museum is. The museum has a little bit for everyone. I spent over 2 hours here and I still didn't see all the separate exhibits. I cant wait to come in April to experience the viking exhibit. An amazing upgrade from the previous building.",
          "If you want to enjoy, be prepared for spending at least 3hrs. This museum is worth visiting. Will definitely revisit.",
          "Not much exotic collection. All they have is Aboriginal art collection.",
          "Worth it everytime I go. Love love love this place and surrounding area.",
          "A world class museum that is well kept and interesting enough to go again and again.",
          "I know the new museum has been getting a lot of bad reviews, but I didn't feel like it was bad at all! The feature Vikings exhibit was interesting, and there were fun interactive things. Despite there being a lot of reading (it is a museum \u2026",
          "I've always enjoyed coming to Edmonton to see the provincial museum. This reviews is only on their updated website. I find it basic and frustrating. There's no direct link for admission fees and hours of operation. As have being there \u2026",
          "The mammoth pass is great value & the museum itself is awesome for families.",
          "I was very excited for the new Royal Alberta Museum. I would say my expectations were only partially met. The building is big and beautiful, but the actual exhibit space seemed underwhelming. With a 2 year old the child area is amazing, but \u2026",
          "A very beautiful building and such an awesome gift shop! There is barely any free parking around the premises, really on paid parking lots and Impark. The galleries were nice but sometimes I felt like there was too much to look at and some displays didn't have an explanation of what the items were.",
          "Very disappointing. Past exhibits in the old building for RAM were more detailed oriented, expansive, and interesting. Now they seem to be more of a hodgepodge of random things that fit together tangentially, with no common thread to tie \u2026",
          "All I can say is WOW! This place is awesome! My kids and I had a wonderful time and we did get to see everything yet! They did a fantastic job on this museum. \n\nI would recommend that if you live in Edmonton you buy an annual pass.  If you \u2026",

          "Amazing place for families, annual pass is great value!",
          "The collections were very extensive. You can easily spend 6h there even if you don't read all the info. I really enjoyed the live insects and the natural history sections.

          "Really fun place to go to, especially for mammoth pass holders. The pass gets you 10% off food and is only about 40 dollars for the whole year. Cool things like insects and dinosaurs.

        "wiki": "Edmonton ( (listen)) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. The city anchors the north end of what Statistics Canada defines as the \"Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor\".The city had a population of 932,546 in 2016, making it Alberta's second-largest city and Canada's fifth-largest municipality. Edmonton's 2019 municipal census subsequently recorded a population of 972,223. Also in 2016, Edmonton had a metropolitan population of 1,321,426, making it the sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is North America's northernmost metropolitan area with a population over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian.Edmonton's historic growth has been facilitated through the absorption of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North Edmonton, West Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place) in addition to a series of annexations through 1982, and the annexation of 8,260 ha (82.6 km2) of land from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont on January 1, 2019. Known as the \"Gateway to the North\", the city is a staging point for large-scale oil sands projects occurring in northern Alberta and large-scale diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories.Edmonton is a cultural, governmental and educational centre. It hosts a year-round slate of festivals, reflected in the nickname \"Canada's Festival City\". It is home to North America's largest mall, West Edmonton Mall (the world's largest mall from 1981 until 2004), and Fort Edmonton Park, Canada's largest living history museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants arrived in the area that is now Edmonton around 3000 BC and perhaps as early as 12,000 BC when an ice-free corridor opened as the last glacial period ended and timber, water, and wildlife became available in the region.\n\nIn 1754, Anthony Henday, an explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area. His expeditions across the Canadian Prairies were mainly to seek contact with the Indigenous population for establishing the fur trade, as the competition was fierce between the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. \nBy 1795, Fort Edmonton was established on the river's north bank as a major trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company, near the mouth of the Sturgeon River close to present-day Fort Saskatchewan. Fort Edmonton, also known as Edmonton House, was built within \"musket-shot range\" of the rival North West Company's (NWC) Fort Augustus. The fort's name was chosen by William Tomison, who was in charge of its construction, for Edmonton, Middlesex, England, home town of the Lake family \u2013 at least five of whom were influential members of the HBC between 1696-1807. Although both forts were initially successful, declines in beaver pelt hauls and firewood stocks forced both HBC and NWC to move their forts upstream.By 1813, after some changes in location, Fort Edmonton was established in the area of what is now Rossdale, beginning Edmonton's start as a permanent population centre. The fort was located on the border of territory that was disputed by the Blackfoot and Cree nations. Furthermore, the fort intersected territory patrolled by the Blackfoot Confederacy to the South, and the Cree, Dene, and Nakoda nations to the North. After the North West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Augustus was closed in favour of Fort Edmonton.In 1876, Treaty 6, which includes what is now Edmonton, was signed between the Indigenous peoples in Canada (or First Nations) and Queen Victoria as Queen of Canada, as part of the Numbered Treaties of Canada. The agreement includes the Plains and Woods Cree, Assiniboine, and other band governments of First Nations at Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt, and Battle River. The area covered by the treaty represents most of the central area of the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.The coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to southern Alberta in 1885 helped the Edmonton economy, and the 1891 building of the Calgary and Edmonton (C&E) Railway resulted in the emergence of a railway townsite (South Edmonton/Strathcona) on the river's south side, across from Edmonton. The arrival of the CPR and the C&E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs from eastern Canada, Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world. The Edmonton area's fertile soil and cheap land attracted settlers, further establishing Edmonton as a major regional commercial and agricultural centre. Some people participating in the Klondike Gold Rush passed through South Edmonton/Strathcona in 1897. Strathcona was North America's northernmost railway point, but travel to the Klondike was still very difficult for the \"Klondikers,\" and a majority of them took a steamship north to the Yukon from Vancouver, British Columbia.\n \nIncorporated as a town in 1892 with a population of 700 and then as a city in 1904 with a population of 8,350, Edmonton became the capital of Alberta when the province was formed a year later, on September 1, 1905. In November 1905, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) arrived in Edmonton, accelerating growth.During the early 1900s, Edmonton's rapid growth led to speculation in real estate. In 1912, Edmonton amalgamated with the City of Strathcona, south of the North Saskatchewan River; as a result, the city extended south of the North Saskatchewan River for the first time.Just before World War I, the boom ended, and the city's population declined from more than 72,000 in 1914 to less than 54,000 only two years later. Many impoverished families moved to subsistence farms outside the city, while others fled to greener pastures in other provinces. Recruitment to the army during the war also contributed to the drop in population. Afterwards, the city slowly recovered in population and economy during the 1920s and 1930s and took off again during and after World War II.\nThe Edmonton City Centre Airport opened in 1929, becoming Canada's first licensed airfield. Originally named Blatchford Field in honour of former mayor Kenny Blatchford, pioneering aviators such as Wilfrid R. \"Wop\" May and Max Ward used Blatchford Field as a major base for distributing mail, food, and medicine to Northern Canada; hence Edmonton's emergence as the \"Gateway to the North\". World War II saw Edmonton become a major base for the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Northwest Staging Route. The airport was closed in November 2013.On July 31, 1987, a devastating F4 tornado hit the city and killed 27 people. The storm hit the areas of Beaumont, Mill Woods, Bannerman, Fraser, and Evergreen. The day became known as \"Black Friday.\"\n\n\n=== History of municipal governance ===\n\nIn 1892 Edmonton was incorporated as a town. The first mayor was Matthew McCauley, who established the first school board in Edmonton and Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) and a municipal police service. Due to McCauley's good relationship with the federal Liberals, Edmonton maintained economic and political prominence over Strathcona, a rival settlement/town/city on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Edmonton was incorporated as a city in 1904 and became Alberta's capital in 1905.\nIn 1904, the City of Edmonton purchased the Edmonton District Telephone Company  for $17,000 from Alex Taylor (businessman), a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor and politician. Amalgamated into a city department as City of Edmonton Telephone Department, City Telephone System (CTS), 'edmonton telephones'. In 1989, City Council voted to create Edmonton Telephones Corporation  to operate as an autonomous organization under a board of directors appointed by the city. In 1995, City of Edmonton ownership of its telephone service ended when ED TEL was sold to the TELUS corporation. City Bylaw 11713 created The Ed Tel Endowment Fund whereas the shares owned by Edmonton Telephones Corporation in Ed Tel Inc. were sold by the City of Edmonton to Telus on March 10, 1995 for $470,221,872 to be invested for the perpetual benefit of Edmontonians. \nUnions and radical organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World struggled for progressive social change through the early years, with the first reformer, James East, elected in 1912, followed by the first official Labour alderman, James Kinney, the following year. Many thousands of workers participated in the Edmonton general strike of 1919 and a strong block of Labour representatives were on council after the next election: East, Kinney, Sam McCoppen, Rice Sheppard and Joe Clarke.\nThe City used Single Transferable Vote (STV), a form of proportional representation, for elections from 1923 to 1927, in which councillors were elected at large with ranked transferable votes.\nLabour representation on city council became a near-majority in 1929, and a full majority from 1932 to 1934, during the Great Depression. Jan Reimer became the city's first female mayor when she was elected in 1989.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nEdmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River, at an elevation of 671 m (2,201 ft). It is North America's northernmost city with a metropolitan population over one million. It is at the same latitude as Hamburg (Germany); Dublin (Ireland); Manchester (United Kingdom); and Magnitogorsk (Russia). It is south of Alberta's geographic centre, which is near the Hamlet of Fort Assiniboine. The terrain in and around Edmonton is generally flat to gently rolling, with ravines and deep river valleys, such as the North Saskatchewan River valley. The Canadian Rockies are west of Edmonton and about 220 km (140 mi) to the southwest.\nThe North Saskatchewan River originates at the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park and bisects the city. It sometimes floods Edmonton's river valley, most notably in the North Saskatchewan River flood of 1915. It empties via the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. It runs from the southwest to the northeast and is fed by numerous creeks throughout the city, including Mill Creek, Whitemud Creek and Blackmud Creek; these creeks have created ravines, some of which are used for urban parkland. Edmonton is within the Canadian Prairies Ecozone. Aspen parkland surrounds the city and is a transitional area from the prairies to the south and boreal forest in the north. The aspen woods and forests in and around Edmonton have long since been reduced by farming and residential and commercial developments including oil and natural gas exploration.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEdmonton has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dwb). It falls into the NRC 4a Plant Hardiness Zone.The city is known for having cold winters, though its weather is milder than Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, all of which are south of Edmonton. Its average daily temperatures range from a low of \u221210.4 \u00b0C (13.3 \u00b0F) in January to a summer peak of 17.7 \u00b0C (63.9 \u00b0F) in July. With average maximum of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F) in July, and minimum of \u221214.8 \u00b0C (5.4 \u00b0F) in January. Temperatures can exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for an average of four to five days anytime from late April to mid-September and fall below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) for an average of 24.6 days in the winter. The highest temperature recorded in Edmonton was 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), on June 29, 1937. On July 2, 2013, a record high humidex of 44 was recorded, due to an unusually humid day with a temperature of 33.9 \u00b0C (93.0 \u00b0F) and a record high dew point of 23 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Edmonton was \u221249.4 \u00b0C (\u221256.9 \u00b0F), on January 19 and 21, 1886.Summer lasts from late June until early September, and the humidity is seldom uncomfortably high. Winter lasts from November to March and varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short and highly variable. Edmonton's growing season is from May 9 to September 22; it averages 135-140 frost-free days a year. At the summer solstice, Edmonton receives 17 hours and three minutes of daylight, with an hour and 46 minutes of civil twilight. On average Edmonton receives 2,299 hours of bright sunshine per year and is one of Canada's sunniest cities.The summer of 2006 was particularly warm for Edmonton, as temperatures reached 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) or higher more than 20 times from mid-May to early September. The winter of 2011\u201312 was particularly warm; from December 22, 2011, till March 20, 2012, on 53 occasions Edmonton saw temperatures at or above 0.0 \u00b0C (32.0 \u00b0F) at the City Centre Airport, and even warmer in the city proper.Edmonton has a fairly dry climate. On average, it receives 476.9 mm (18.78 in) of precipitation, of which 365.7 mm (14.40 in) is rain and 111.2 mm (4.38 in) is the melt from 123.5 cm (48.6 in) of snowfall per annum. Precipitation is heaviest in the late spring, summer, and early autumn. The wettest month is July, while the driest months are February, March, October, and November. In July the mean precipitation is 91.7 mm (3.61 in). Dry spells are not uncommon and may occur at any time of the year. Extremes do occur, such as the 114 mm (4.49 in) of rainfall that fell on July 31, 1953. Summer thunderstorms can be frequent and occasionally severe enough to produce large hail, damaging winds, funnel clouds, and occasionally tornadoes. Twelve tornadoes had been recorded in Edmonton between 1890 and 1989, and eight since 1990. An F4 tornado that struck Edmonton on July 31, 1987, killing 27, was unusual in many respects, including severity, duration, damage, and casualties. It is commonly referred to as Black Friday due both to its aberrant characteristics and the emotional shock it generated. Then-mayor Laurence Decore cited the community's response to the tornado as evidence that Edmonton was a \"city of champions,\" which later became an unofficial slogan of the city.A massive cluster of thunderstorms occurred on July 11, 2004, with large hail and over 100 mm (4 in) of rain reported within an hour in many places. This \"1-in-200 year event\" flooded major intersections and underpasses and damaged both residential and commercial properties. The storm caused extensive damage to West Edmonton Mall; a small glass section of the roof collapsed under the weight of the rainwater, causing water to drain onto the mall's indoor ice rink. As a result, the mall was evacuated as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nEdmonton is at the centre of Canada's sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA), which includes Edmonton and 34 other municipalities in the surrounding area. Larger urban communities include Sherwood Park (an urban service area within Strathcona County), the cities of St. Albert, Beaumont, Leduc, Spruce Grove and Fort Saskatchewan, and the towns of Stony Plain, Morinville, and Devon. Major employment areas outside Edmonton but within the CMA include the Nisku Industrial Business Park and the Edmonton International Airport (including a planned inland port logistics support facility in support of the Port Alberta initiative) in Leduc County, the Acheson Industrial Area in Parkland County, Refinery Row in Strathcona County and Alberta's Industrial Heartland within portions of Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County and Sturgeon County. Alberta's Industrial Heartland also extends beyond the CMA's northeastern boundary into Lamont County.The individual economic development interests and costs of service delivery in certain municipalities within the region have led to intermunicipal competition, strained intermunicipal relationships and overall fragmentation of the region. Although several attempts have been made by the City of Edmonton to absorb surrounding municipalities or annex portions of its neighbours, the city has not absorbed another municipality since the Town of Jasper Place joined Edmonton on August 17, 1964, and the city has not annexed land from any of its neighbours since January 1, 1982. After years of mounting pressure in the early 21st century, the Province of Alberta formed the Capital Region Board (CRB) on April 15, 2008. The CRB consists of 24 member municipalities \u2013 22 of which are within the Edmonton CMA and two of which are outside the CMA. The City of Edmonton announced in March 2013 its intent to annex 156 square kilometres of land (including the Edmonton International Airport) from Leduc County.On November 30, 2016, the City of Edmonton and Leduc County came to an agreement on Edmonton's annexation proposal.

It and the surrounding Boyle Street, Central McDougall, Cloverdale, Garneau, McCauley, Oliver, Queen Mary Park, Riverdale, Rossdale, Strathcona and University of Alberta form Edmonton's Central Core. Oliver and Garneau are the city's most populated and most densely populated neighbourhoods respectively. The mature area sector also contains the five former urban municipalities annexed by the city over its history: Beverly, Jasper Place, North Edmonton, Strathcona and West Edmonton (Calder).Larger residential areas within Edmonton's six suburban sectors, each comprising multiple neighbourhoods, include Heritage Valley, Kaskitayo, Riverbend, Terwillegar Heights and Windermere (southwest sector); The Grange, Lewis Farms and West Jasper Place (west sector); Big Lake (northwest sector); Castle Downs, Lake District and The Palisades (north sector); Casselman-Steele Heights, Clareview, Hermitage, Londonderry and Pilot Sound (northeast sector); and Ellerslie, The Meadows, Mill Woods and Southeast Edmonton (southeast sector). Mill Woods is divided into a town centre community (Mill Woods Town Centre) and eight surrounding communities: Burnewood, Knottwood, Lakewood, Millbourne, Millhurst, Ridgewood, Southwood, and Woodvale. Each has between two and four neighbourhoods.\n\nSeveral transit-oriented developments (TOD) have begun to appear along the LRT line at Clareview, with future developments planned at Belvedere (part of the Old Town Fort Road Redevelopment Project). Another TOD, Century Park, is being constructed at the site of what was once Heritage Mall, at the southern end of the LRT line. Century Park will eventually house up to 5,000 residents.The Edmonton City Centre Airport is planned to be redeveloped into a sustainable community of 30,000 people comprising a transit-oriented mixed use town centre, townhouses, low, medium and high rise apartments, neighbourhood retail and service uses, and a major park.Edmonton has four major industrial districts: the Northwest Industrial District, the Northeast Industrial District, the Southeast Industrial District, and the emerging Edmonton Energy and Technology Park, which is part of Alberta's Industrial Heartland.

According to the 2011 Canadian Household Survey, 59.1 percent of metropolitan Edmonton residents identify as Christian. Significant religious minorities include Muslims (4.1 percent), Sikhs (1.8 percent), Buddhists (1.5 percent), Hindus (1.4 percent), Jewish people (0.3 percent), and practitioners of traditional Aboriginal spirituality (0.2 percent). Those belonging to smaller religions account for 0.5 percent, while 31.1 percent profess no religious affiliation.Within Christianity, major denominations include the Roman Catholic Church (44.4 percent of self-identified Christians) and the United Church (10.5 percent). Edmonton is home to four major cathedrals, with St. Joseph's Basilica seating the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton, All Saints' Cathedral seating the Anglican Diocese of Edmonton, St. Josaphat Cathedral seating the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and St. John Cathedral seating the Ukrainian Orthodox Eparchy of Western Canada. Additionally, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are served by the Edmonton Alberta Temple.\nIn the 1930s, the local Muslim community began organizing to build a mosque. A local Muslim woman, Hilwie Hamdon, met with the mayor to acquire the land, and campaigned to raise $5,000 for the building. In 1938, Abdullah Yusuf Ali was present at the opening of the new Al-Rashid Mosque, which became the first mosque established in Canada and the third in North America. In the 1980s, Muslim students at the University of Alberta found it difficult to rent prayer rooms large enough to accommodate the local population, and opened the Muslim Community of Edmonton as a mosque and outreach centre in 1992. From these beginnings, Muslims now form the city's largest religious minority, with 46,125 members (2011) representing over 62 ethnic backgrounds at over 20 Edmonton-area mosques (2019).Edmonton's Jewish community is represented by the Jewish Federation of Edmonton, operating the historic Edmonton Jewish Cemetery, purchased in 1907. The city contains six synagogues. The oldest, Beth Israel, was established in 1912 and served as home of Canada's first Jewish day school. Other Abrahamic religions active in Edmonton include the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, operating a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Centre in Norwood, and Druze, with its Canadian Druze Centre located in the Northwest Industrial District.\n\nEdmonton also hosts a Maronite Catholic church, on 76 Avenue/98 Street, with services in English on Saturdays and Arabic on Sundays. The Hindu Community in Edmonton is served by the Hindu Society of Alberta (North Indian Temple) and the Maha Ganapathy Society of Alberta (South Indian Temple).

Edmonton is also home to two of Alberta's five Unitarian Universalist congregations \u2013 the Unitarian Church of Edmonton and the Westwood Unitarian Congregation; the other three are located in Calgary, Lethbridge, and Red Deer.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEdmonton is the major economic centre for northern and central Alberta and a major centre for the oil and gas industry. As of 2014, the estimated value of major projects within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region was $57.8-billion, of which $34.4-billion are within the oil and gas, oil sands, and pipeline sectors.Edmonton traditionally has been a hub for Albertan petrochemical industries, earning it the nickname \"Oil Capital of Canada\" in the 1940s. Supply and service industries drive the energy extraction engine, while research develops new technologies and supports expanded value-added processing of Alberta's massive oil, gas, and oil sands reserves. These are reported to be the second-largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia.Much of the growth in technology sectors is due to Edmonton's reputation as one of Canada's premier research and education centres. Research initiatives are anchored by educational institutions such as the University of Alberta (U of A) as well as government initiatives underway at Alberta Innovates and Edmonton Research Park. The U of A campus is home to the National Institute for Nanotechnology.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Edmonton became a major financial centre, with both regional offices of Canada's major banks and locally based institutions opening. However, the turmoil of the late-1980s economy radically changed the situation. Locally based operations such as Principal Trust and Canadian Commercial Bank would fail, and some regional offices were moved to other cities. The 1990s saw a solidification of the economy, and Edmonton is now home to Canadian Western Bank, the only publicly traded Schedule I chartered bank headquarters west of Toronto. Other major financial institutions include ATB Financial, Servus Credit Union (formerly Capital City Savings), TD Canada Trust and Manulife Financial.Edmonton has been the birthplace of several companies that have grown to international stature. The local retail market has also seen the creation of many successful store concepts, such as The Brick, Katz Group, AutoCanada, Boston Pizza, Pizza 73, Liquor Stores GP (which includes Liquor Depot, Liquor Barn, OK Liquor, and Grapes & Grains), Planet Organic, Shaw Communications, Empire Design, Running Room, Booster Juice, Earl's, Fountain Tire and XS Cargo.Edmonton's geographical location has made it an ideal spot for distribution and logistics. CN Rail's North American operational facility is located in the city, as well as a major intermodal facility that handles all incoming freight from the port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia. In early 2020, CN Rail announced that it was closing its Montreal control centre and would eventually close its Vancouver control centre as well, with a goal to consolidate all of its control operations into Edmonton.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nEdmonton is home to several shopping malls and the largest mall in North America, West Edmonton Mall, which is also considered to be the 10th largest mall in the world. Other mentionable malls include Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre, Edmonton City Centre (a combination of the former Edmonton Centre and Eaton Centre malls), Southgate Centre, Kingsway Mall, Northgate Centre, Riverview Crossing, Londonderry Mall, and Mill Woods Town Centre.Edmonton also has many big box shopping centres and power centres. Some of the major ones include South Edmonton Common (North America's largest open air retail development), Mayfield Common, Westpoint, Skyview Power Centre, Terra Losa Centre, Oliver Square, Southpark Centre, The Meadows, Christy's Corner, Currents of Windermere, and Manning Village.In contrast to suburban centres, Edmonton has many urban retail locations. The largest of them all, Old Strathcona, includes many independent stores between 99 Street and 109 Street, on Whyte Avenue and in the surrounding area. In and around Downtown Edmonton, there are a few shopping districts, including the Edmonton City Centre mall, Jasper Avenue, and 104 Street. Near Oliver, 124 Street is home to a significant number of retail stores. Edmonton is the Canadian testing ground for many American retailers, such as Bath & Body Works and Calvin Klein.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\nMany events are anchored in the downtown Arts District, centred around Churchill Square (named in honour of Sir Winston Churchill). On the south side of the river, the University district and Whyte Avenue contain theatres, concert halls, and various live music venues. The centrepiece of the square builds a life-size bronze statue of Churchill, unveiled by Lady Soames on May 24, 1989. It is a copy of a statue by Oscar Nemon.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Francis Winspear Centre for Music opened in 1997 after years of planning and fundraising. Described as one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in Canada, it is home to the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and hosts a wide variety of shows every year. It seats 1,932 patrons and houses the $3-million Davis Concert Organ, the largest concert organ in Canada. Across 102 Avenue is the Citadel Theatre, named after The Salvation Army Citadel in which Joe Shoctor first started the Citadel Theatre Company in 1965. It is now one of the largest theatre complexes in Canada, with five halls, each specializing in different kinds of productions. In 2015 the Citadel Theatre also became home to Catalyst Theatre. On the University of Alberta grounds is the 2,534-seat Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, which had over a year of heavy renovations as part of the province's 2005 centennial celebrations. Both it and its southern twin in Calgary were constructed in 1955 for the province's golden jubilee and have hosted many concerts, musicals, and ballets. On the front of the building is a quote from Suetonius' Life of Augustus: \"He found a city built of brick \u2013 left it built of marble.\"\nThe Old Strathcona neighbourhood is home to the Theatre District, which holds the ATB Financial Arts Barns (headquarters of the Edmonton International Fringe Festival), The Walterdale Playhouse, and the Varscona Theatre (base of operations for several theatre companies, including Teatro la Quindicina, Shadow Theatre, Die-Nasty, Plane Jane Theatre, and Grindstone Theatre!). Edmonton was named cultural capital of Canada in 2007. The Ukrainian Dnipro Ensemble of Edmonton, along with other Ukrainian choirs such as the Ukrainian Male Chorus of Edmonton, helps preserve the Ukrainian musical culture within the parameters of the Canadian multicultural identity in Edmonton.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nEdmonton hosts several large festivals each year, contributing to its nickname, \"Canada's Festival City\". Downtown Edmonton's Churchill Square host numerous festivals each summer. The Works Art & Design Festival, which takes place from late June to early July, showcases Canadian and international art and design from well-known award-winning artists as well as emerging and student artists. The Edmonton International Street Performer's Festival takes place in mid-July and is the biggest of its kind in North America. The TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival takes place in late June and, along with Montreal, were the first jazz festivals in Canada.\n\nEdmonton's main summer festival is K-Days, formerly Klondike Days, Capital Ex and originally the Edmonton Exhibition. Founded in 1879, the Edmonton Exhibition was originally an annual fair and exhibition that eventually adopted a gold rush theme, becoming Klondike Days in the 1960s. Northlands, the operators, renamed the festival \"Edmonton's Capital Ex\" or \"Capital Ex\" in 2006. In 2012 Edmonton Northlands conducted a poll to rename the festival that resulted in changing the name to \"K-Days\".  The Canadian Finals Rodeo was held in Edmonton from 1974 to 2017, but moved to Red Deer in 2018 due to the closure of the Coliseum.The Edmonton International Fringe Festival, held in mid-August, is the largest fringe theatre festival in North America. Also in August Edmonton hosts the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, the fourth major folk festival in Canada. Other summer festivals in and around Edmonton include the Edmonton Heritage Festival, Taste of Edmonton, Chaos Alberta Festival, Interstellar Rodeo, Big Valley Jambore, Pigeon Lake Music Festival, Edmonton Rockfest, Edmonton International Reggae Jamboree Festival, Edmonton Blues Festival and Cariwest.

Edmonton has a history of opera and classical music performance; both have been supported by a variety of clubs and associations. Edmonton's first major radio station, CKUA, began broadcasting music in 1927. The city is a centre for music instruction; the University of Alberta began its music department in 1945, and MacEwan University opened a jazz and musical theatre program in 1980. Festivals of jazz, folk, and classical music are popular entertainment events in the city.The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra has existed under various incarnations since 1913. In 1952 the Edmonton Philharmonic and the Edmonton Pops orchestras amalgamated to form the 60-member modern version. The Orchestra performs at the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.The city also has a vibrant popular music scene, across genres including hip-hop, reggae, R&B, rock, pop, metal, punk, country and electronic. Notable past and present local musicians include Robert Goulet, Tommy Banks, Stu Davis, Tim Feehan, Cadence Weapon, Kreesha Turner, The Smalls, SNFU, Social Code, Stereos, Ten Second Epic, Tupelo Honey, Mac DeMarco, Shout Out Out Out Out, Psyche, Purity Ring, The Wet Secrets, Nuela Charles, Celeigh Cardinal, and Ruth B.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nThere are several key areas of nightlife in Edmonton. The most popular is the Whyte Avenue (82 Avenue) strip, between 109 Street and 99 Street; it has the highest number of heritage buildings in Edmonton, and bars, clubs, and restaurants throughout, but mostly west of Gateway Boulevard (103 Street). Once the heart of the town of Strathcona (annexed by Edmonton on February 1, 1912), it fell into disrepair during the middle of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, a coordinated effort to revive the area through a business revitalization zone produced an area rich with restored historical buildings and pleasant streetscapes. Its proximity to the University of Alberta has led to a high number of restaurants, pubs, trendy clubs, and retail and specialty shops. This area also has two independent movie theatres, the Garneau and Princess, as well as several live theatre, music, and comedy venues.Downtown Edmonton has undergone a continual process of renewal and growth since the mid-1990s. Many buildings were demolished during the oil boom, starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s, to make way for office towers. There have always been numerous pub-type establishments, hotel lounges, and restaurants. The past decade has seen a strong resurgence in more mainstream venues. Edmonton also has a high demand for pub crawl tours in the city. Various clubs are found along Edmonton's main street, Jasper Avenue. The Edmonton City Centre mall also houses a Landmark Cinemas movie theatre with nine screens. The nonprofit Metro Cinema shows a variety of alternative or otherwise unreleased films every week.\nWest Edmonton Mall holds several after-hour establishments in addition to its many stores and attractions. Bourbon Street has numerous eating establishments; clubs and casinos can also be found within the complex. Scotiabank Theatre (formerly known as Silver City), at the west end of the mall, is a theatre with 12 screens and an IMAX.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Parkland and environment ===\n\nEdmonton's river valley constitutes the longest stretch of connected urban parkland in North America, and Edmonton has the highest amount of parkland per capita of any Canadian city; the river valley is 22 times larger than New York City's Central Park. The river valley is home to various parks ranging from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities. This main \"Ribbon of Green\" is supplemented by numerous neighbourhood parks located throughout the city, to give a total of 111 km2 (27,400 acres) of parkland. Within the 7,400 ha (18,000 acres), 25 km (16 mi)-long river valley park system, there are 11 lakes, 14 ravines, and 22 major parks, and most of the city has accessible bike and walking trail connections. These trails are also part of the 235 km (146 mi) Waskahegan walking trail. The City of Edmonton has named five parks in its River Valley Parks System in honour of each of \"The Famous Five\".\n\nEdmonton's streets and parklands also contain one of the largest remaining concentrations of healthy American elm trees in the world, unaffected by Dutch elm disease, which has wiped out vast numbers of such trees in eastern North America. Jack pine, lodgepole pine, white spruce, white birch, aspen, mountain ash, Amur maple, Russian olive, green ash, basswood, various poplars and willows, flowering crabapple, Mayday tree and Manitoba maple are also abundant; bur oak, silver maple, hawthorn and Ohio buckeye are increasingly popular. Other introduced tree species include white ash, blue spruce, Norway maple, red oak, sugar maple, common horse-chestnut, McIntosh apple, and Evans cherry. Three walnut species \u2013 butternut, Manchurian walnut, and black walnut \u2013 have survived in Edmonton.Several golf courses, both public and private, are also located in the river valley; the long summer daylight hours of this northern city provide for extended play from early morning well into the evening. Golf courses and the park system become a winter recreation area during this season, and cross-country skiing and skating are popular during the long winter. Four downhill ski slopes are located in the river valley as well, two within the city and two immediately outside.\n\nThe Edmonton & Area Land Trust (EALT) is a charity focused on conserving natural areas in Edmonton and surrounding municipalities. Its first project in Edmonton was conserving Larch Sanctuary, via a 59-acre Conservation Easement with the City, straddling Whitemud Creek south of 23rd Avenue, and containing the only oxbow lake in the City. EALT works with many organisations in Edmonton, and is currently working to conserve the 233 acres of Forest and Farmland in a loop of the river in North East Edmonton.\nA variety of volunteer opportunities exist for citizens to participate in the stewardship of Edmonton's parkland and river valley. Volunteer programs include River Valley Clean-up, Root for Trees, and Partner in Parks.  River Valley Clean-up engages volunteers to pick up hundreds of bags of litter each year.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThere are many museums in Edmonton of various sizes.  The largest is the Royal Alberta Museum (RAM), which was formerly known as the Provincial Museum of Alberta until it was renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's 2005 Alberta centennial visit. The RAM houses over 10 million objects in its collection and showcases the culture and practices of the diverse aboriginal tribes of the region. In 2018, the building relocated from its location in Glenora to a new building in downtown on 103A Avenue and 97 Street.

Edmonton's heritage is displayed through historical buildings (many of which are originals moved to the park), costumed historical interpreters, and authentic artifacts. In total, it covers the region's history from approximately 1795 to 1929 (represented by Fort Edmonton), followed chronologically by 1885, 1905, and 1920 streets, and a recreation of a 1920s midway. A steam train, streetcars, automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles may be seen in operation (and utilized by the public) around the park. The John Walter Museum and Historical Area (c. 1875 to 1901) is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.  The University of Alberta operates its own internal Museums and Collections service.The Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is the city's largest single gallery. Formerly housed in an iconic 1970s Brutalist building designed by Don Bittorf, the AGA collection had over 5,000 pieces of art. The former AGA building was demolished in July 2007 to make way for construction of a new facility designed by Randall Stout. It was estimated to cost over $88-million and the amount that Edmonton City Council donated towards its construction was met with some controversy. The AGA officially opened on January 31, 2010. Commercial art galleries can be found throughout the city, especially along the 124 Street/Jasper Avenue corridor, known as the \"gallery walk\".Edmonton is home to four artist-run centres all located in the downtown core Harcourt House, Latitude 53, Ociciwan Contemporary Art Collective and Society of Northern Alberta Print-Artists (SNAP).

One of the MLAs, Rachel Notley, is also the Leader of the Opposition.\n\n\n=== Federal politics ===\nEdmonton is represented by nine Members of Parliament (MP), with one being elected to represent each of its federal electoral districts. In the current 43rd Canadian Parliament, eight MPs are members of the Conservative Party of Canada, while the remaining MP is part of the New Democratic Party. After the 2019 federal election, Edmonton lacked elected representation in the federal government for the first time since 1980.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe city's police force, the Edmonton Police Service, was founded in 1892, and had approximately 1,400 officers in 2012. Edmonton experienced a decrease in crime in the 1990s, an increase in the early 2000s, and another downturn at the end of the decade.\n\nThe Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) had a crime severity index of 84.5 in 2013, which is higher than the national average of 68.7. Its crime severity index was the fifth-highest among CMAs in Canada behind Regina, Saskatoon, Kelowna and Vancouver. Edmonton had the fourth-most homicides in 2013 at 27.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nEdmonton is home to 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), the Regular Force army brigade group of Land Force Western Area of the Canadian Army. Units in 1 CMBG include Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), 1 Combat Engineer Regiment, two of the three regular force battalions of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and various headquarters, service, and support elements. Although not part of 1 CMBG, 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron and 1 Field Ambulance are located with the brigade group.  All of these units are located at Lancaster Park, immediately north of the city. From 1943, as CFB Namao (now CFB Edmonton/Edmonton Garrison), it was a major air force base.  In 1996, all fixed-wing aviation units were transferred to CFB Cold Lake.\nThe Canadian Airborne Training Centre had been located in the city in the 1980s. The move of 1 CMBG and component units from Calgary occurred in 1996 in what was described as a cost-saving measure. The brigade had existed in Calgary since the 1950s, and Lord Strathcona's Horse had traditionally been a Calgary garrison unit dating back to before World War I.\nEdmonton also has a large army reserve element from 41 Canadian Brigade Group (41 CBG), including The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (4th Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry); 41 Combat Engineer Regiment; HQ Battery, 20th Field Artillery Regiment; and B Squadron of The South Alberta Light Horse, one of Alberta's oldest army reserve units. Despite being far from Canada's coasts, Edmonton is also the home of HMCS Nonsuch, a naval reserve division. There are numerous cadet corps of the different elements (naval, army and air force) within Edmonton as well.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Aviation ====\n\nEdmonton is a major air transportation gateway to northern Alberta and northern Canada. The Edmonton International Airport (EIA) is the main airport serving the city.\nThe EIA provides passenger service to destinations in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The EIA is located within Leduc County, adjacent to the City of Leduc and the Nisku Industrial Business Park. With direct air distances from Edmonton to places such as London in United Kingdom being shorter than to other main airports in western North America, Edmonton Airports is working to establish a major container shipping hub called Port Alberta.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nEdmonton serves as a major transportation hub for Canadian National Railway, whose North American operations management centre is located at their Edmonton offices. It is also tied into the Canadian Pacific Railway network, which provides service from Calgary to the south and extends northeast of Edmonton to serve Alberta's Industrial Heartland.\nInter-city rail passenger rail service is provided by Via Rail's premier train, the Canadian, as it travels between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario. Passenger trains stop at the Edmonton railway station three days a week in both directions. The train connects Edmonton to multiple stops in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\n\nThe Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) is the city's public transit agency, operating the Edmonton Light Rail Transit (LRT) line as well as a fleet of buses. As of 2009 there were 354,440 boardings per day (in a population of 1,034,945). There are approximately 280,000 ETS bus boardings, 54,000 LRT boardings, and 3,500 paratransit boardings per weekday.From the 1990s to early 2009, Edmonton was one of two cities in Canada still operating trolley buses, along with Vancouver. On June 18, 2008, City Council decided to abandon the Edmonton trolley bus system and the last trolley bus ran on May 2, 2009.Scheduled LRT service began on April 23, 1978, with five extensions of the single line completed since. The original Edmonton line is considered to be the first \"modern\" light rail line in North America (i.e., built from scratch, rather than being an upgrade of an old system). It introduced the use of German-designed rolling stock that subsequently became the standard light rail vehicle of the United States. The Edmonton \"proof-of-payment\" fare collection system adopted in 1980 \u2013 modelled after European ticket systems \u2013 became the North American transit industry's preferred approach for subsequent light rail projects. The four-year South LRT extension was opened in full on April 24, 2010, which sees trains travelling to Century Park (located at 23 Avenue and 111 Street), making stops at South Campus and Southgate Centre along the way. A line to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in north-central Edmonton using the same high floor technology of the existing system opened September 6, 2015. Edmonton currently constructing the southeast leg of the Valley Line, which starts in Mill Woods and ends in the downtown core. The southeast portion is expected to open in 2021, after experiencing significant delays. Construction on the second and final phase of the Valley Line, which will extend the line west to Lewis Farms, is expected to commence in 2021. Unlike the Capital and Metro lines, trains on the Valley Line will utilize low-floor technology.\n\nA largely gridded system forms most of Edmonton's street and road network. The address system is mostly numbered, with streets running south to north and avenues running east to west. In built-up areas built since the 1950s, local streets and major roadways generally do not conform to the grid system. Major roadways include Kingsway, Yellowhead Trail (Highway 16), Whitemud Drive and Anthony Henday Drive.\nThe major roads connecting to other communities elsewhere in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan are the Yellowhead Highway to the west and east and Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway) to the south.\n\n\n==== Trail system ====\nEdmonton maintains over 160 kilometres (99 mi) of multi-use trails; however, most of this is within the river valley parkland system.\n\n\n=== Electricity and water ===\nEdmonton's first power company established itself in 1891 and installed streetlights along the city's main avenue, Jasper Avenue. The power company was bought by the Town of Edmonton in 1902 and remains under municipal ownership today as EPCOR. Also in charge of water treatment, in 2002 EPCOR installed the world's largest ultraviolet (UV) water treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) system at its E. L. Smith Water Treatment Plant.\n\n\n=== Waste disposal ===\n\nThe Edmonton Composting Facility, the largest of its type in the world, is also the largest stainless steel building in North America. Among the innovative uses for the city's waste includes a Christmas tree recycling program. The trees are collected each January and put through a woodchipper; this material is used as an addition to the composting process. In addition, the wood chips absorb much of the odour produced by the compost by providing a biofilter element to trap odour causing gaseous results of the process. The composting facility was permanently shut down in 2019 after an inspection found that the structural integrity of its roof was compromised.  Edmonton is currently operating a pilot project for organics waste collection, with approximately 8,000 households in thirteen different neighbourhoods participating.Together, the Waste Management Centre and Wastewater Treatment plant are known as the Edmonton Waste Management Centre of Excellence. Research partners include the University of Alberta, the Alberta Research Council, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, and Olds College.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nThere are four main hospitals serving Edmonton: University of Alberta Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital, Misericordia Community Hospital, and Grey Nuns Community Hospital. Other area hospitals include Sturgeon Community Hospital in St. Albert, Leduc Community Hospital in Leduc, Westview Health Centre in Stony Plain, and Fort Saskatchewan Community Hospital in Fort Saskatchewan. Dedicated psychiatric care is provided at the Alberta Hospital. The Northeast Community Health Centre offers a 24-hour emergency room with no inpatient ward services. The University of Alberta Hospital is the centre of a larger complex of hospitals and clinics located adjacent to the university campus which comprises the Stollery Children's Hospital, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Cross Cancer Institute, Zeidler Gastrointestinal Health Centre, Ledcor Clinical Training Centre, and Edmonton Clinic. Several health research institutes, including the Heritage Medical Research Centre, Medical Sciences Building, Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, and Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, are also located at this site. A similar set-up is also evident at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, which is connected to the Lois Hole Hospital for Women and Orthopaedic Surgery Centre. All hospitals are under the administration of Alberta Health Services, although Misericordia and Grey Nuns are run separately by Covenant Health.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary ===\nEdmonton has three publicly funded school boards (districts) that provide kindergarten and grades 1\u201312. The vast majority of students attend schools in the two large English-language boards: Edmonton Public Schools, and the separate Edmonton Catholic School District. Also, since 1994, the Francophone minority community has had their own school board based in Edmonton, the Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 2, which includes surrounding communities. The city also has a number of public charter schools that are independent of any board. All three school boards and public charter schools are funded through provincial grants and property taxes.\nSome private schools exist as well, including Edmonton Academy, Progressive Academy and Tempo School.Edmonton Public Schools is known for pioneering the concept of site-based decision making (decentralization) in Canada, which gives principals the authority, the financial resources and the flexibility to make decisions based on the individual needs of their schools. This initiative has led to Edmonton Public offering an school of choice model in which students have more options as to what school they want to attend to suit their interests, and has led to the creation of alternative programs such as Vimy Ridge Academy, Old Scona Academic and Victoria School of the Arts. The Edmonton Society for Christian Education and Millwoods Christian School (not part of the former) used to be private schools; however, have both also become part of Edmonton Public Schools as alternative programs.Both the Edmonton Public Schools and the Edmonton Catholic School District provide support and resources for those wishing to homeschool their children.\n\n\n=== Post-secondary ===\n\nThose post-secondary institutions based in Edmonton that are publicly funded include Concordia University of Edmonton, MacEwan University, King's University, NorQuest College, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) and the University of Alberta (U of A). The publicly funded Athabasca University also has a campus in Edmonton.The U of A is a board-governed institution that has an annual revenue of over one billion dollars. In 2011/12, the university had over 38,000 students enrolled within nearly 400 undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, as well as over 15,000 students enrolled in its faculty of extension. The U of A is also home to the second-largest research library system in Canada.In 2010/11, MacEwan University had a total student population of over 43,000 students, including nearly 14,000 full-time students, enrolled in programs offering bachelor's degrees, university transfers, diplomas and certificates. NAIT has an approximate total of 61,200 students enrolled in more than 200 programs while NorQuest College has approximately 8,500 students enrolled in various full-time, part-time and continuing education programs.Other post-secondary institutions within Edmonton include Newman Theological College, Taylor University College and Seminary and Yellowhead Tribal College, a First Nations college.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nEdmonton has seven local broadcast television stations shown on basic cable TV or over-the-air, with the oldest broadcasters in the city being CTV (1961) and CBC (1954).  Most of Edmonton's conventional television stations have made the switch to over-the-air digital broadcasting. The cable television providers in Edmonton are TELUS (for IPTV) and Shaw Cable. Twenty-one FM and eight AM radio stations are based in Edmonton.Edmonton has two large-circulation daily newspapers, the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun.  The Journal, established in 1903 and owned by the Postmedia Network, has a daily circulation of 112,000, while the Sun, established in 1978 and owned by Sun Media, has a circulation of 55,000. The Journal no longer publishes a Sunday edition as of July 2012.Metro, Edmonton's only free daily newspaper, ceased printing on December 20, 2019. The magazine Vue Weekly, a weekly publication which focused on alternative news, was published in Edmonton from 1995-2018. The Edmonton Examiner is a citywide community-based paper also published weekly. There are also a number of smaller weekly and community newspapers.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n\nEdmonton has five sister cities, with one American city listed by Sister Cities International. Edmonton was Nashville's first sister city and in 2015, the cities celebrated the 25th anniversary of their partnership. In 2014 and 2015, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean visited Edmonton during the Canadian Country Music Awards and the Edmonton Folk Music Festival. At the Folk Festival, Mayor Dean addressed the crowd of 20,000 and together with civic and arts leaders, celebrated the 25th anniversary of our sister city twinning. In August 2015, more than 150 Canadians visited Nashville to attend native son Brett Kissel's Grand Ole Opry debut and to meet with Sister Cities representatives. In November 2015, Doug Hoyer and Jeremy Witten represented Edmonton at World of Friendship, Nashville's annual sister cities celebration.\n Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, since 1967\n Harbin, China, since 1985\n Nashville, Tennessee, United States, since 1990\n Wonju, South Korea, since 1998\n Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, since 2013\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cities in Alberta\nList of communities in Alberta\nList of mayors of Edmonton\nList of people from Edmonton\nList of tallest buildings in Edmonton\nEdmonton Federation of Community Leagues\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

          "What a wonderful experience! We have been to this over several years, and it is great thing to do on a winter day or evening. The light is very different at different times of the day. The evening is great and the sunset can be spectacular. Well worth the price of admission. Go",

          "I've went to the ice castles since they first came to Edmonton. Each year gets even better! You can visit for as long as you want but once you exit, you can't re-enter unless you pay the admission fee again. To start off on a reasonably warm day, I recommend going about 30",
          "The best time to go is definitely around dusk, so you can see everything in the light but then also enjoy the lighting effects once it's dark. This is a great place to visit once but I wouldn't go back just based on the prices - too expensive for a family (Almost $80 for a",

          "This is my first visit and its beautiful, but its most likely to be the last for me. The entire time I was visiting the Edmonton Ice Castle, I can't stop thinking about the precious water resource being used to build it, and once it melts, having it drain down into the sewer",

          "Visited the ice castle midweek at 4pm. Staff are excellent. They charged my phone as I was on 1%battery and my tickets were on my Phone. (I am also international and didn\u2019t know my way around without my phone). So cannot vault the friendliness and how accommodating the staff",
          "Went with my 4 year old and sister. We all enjoyed it. Especially my daughter. The slides were her favorite. There was even a fire there to stay warm if it's cold out. Of course it was a bit pricey. $18 each. We still can't wait to go again next year.",

          "This ice castle is not super large, but it's very beautiful, the ice sculptures are really amazing! Several ice slides for kids to play. But the weather is too cold. Although they don't limit your visiting time, but if you enter around 4 or 5 o'clock, you have to wait for about",
          "If you\u2019re headed to Edmonton, this is a must-see!! While you have to be sure to bundle up, the Ice Castles make you feel like a kid again. Buying tickets online was easy and more cost efficient. Loved the neighbouring events at the festival, as well as the warm mini donuts as",

Upon arriving in the parking lot at Hawrelak Park, I was like, \u201cokay now where do we go... nevermind\u201d. You truly cannot miss the structure. It\u2019s",
          "I can\u2019t believe the amount of work they put toward making these castles. So beautiful and stunning. We go here every year. Do not miss it!",
          "Great for family and for edmonton to have this in our city. Just gets better every year. EveryOne should visit while we have this here",
          "They did a great job on this fantastic must see! Friendly staff. Only a couple bucks entrance fee. Slides for the kids. A great day with the family!",
          "This is a great place to go in the winter! Dress warm of course as this is an ICE Castle. I've done it every year in both daylight and nighttime. In the day (clear day) its so beautiful to see all the detail they put into it whereas in the night they light it up the most amazing",
          "Eye catching structures (with many nerve wracking icicles!), and the slides are fun too. Take time to walk around twice, and let the kids explore on their own.",
          "I went twice because by night you see the lights but not the detail in the formation and by day you see the detail but not the lights. I was lucky to be there on un-crowded days and had a good wander. It's not something you are going to spend your entire night/day at. Once",
          "A must see for the few short weeks it is here. Because of the thaw/freeze cycle and the constant watering by the ice masters, the castles changes some from week to week. Night time is best as the lights are amazing. A camera cannot capture it's true beauty.",
          "This was our first visit to the ice castles, bought our tickets online and had no problem getting in early (first time) Saturday morning. It wasn\u2019t TOO busy at first, but then it started to get really busy. We were lucky to get lots of pictures without other people, but I\u2019m sure",
          "We went on a day that was mild as far as temperatures go and it was fantastic. There were a lot of people there but we just took our time and waited in some areas so we could get a better look when other people moved along. The staff were very friendly and provided interesting",
          "Our family went there in the evening so that we could see the various lights that are all over the castle. We weren't dissappointed. This place it really \"cool\"! There was a fountain surrounded by ice. Also a fire was going which helped to warm us up a bit. It was -13 when",
          "I've been to Ice Castles last 2015 and went there again this year, 2017. It was great to see the castle once again but to be honest, there is not much different from the Ice castle that I saw from 2015. It's definitely a good experience for first-timers but it is not recommended",
          "Have been before and decided to see it again this year. Much better organized and less commotion with parking and entrance this year. Not as many lights but there was one area of LED lights that changed as was nice. Don't try and use the outdoor porta potties",
          "We enjoyed the castle as it was intriguing how it was formed. Staff were friendly, willing to take photos and happy to answer questions. Not as impressive in the daylight but at dusk and through to dark is beautiful. Would recommend doing once just to see and experience it.",
          "This was way better than the previous years I have attended. There is a water feature, really amazing lights within the castle, lots of different spaces and 2 slides. There is a fire, if you get chilly. No outside food or drink allowed, so don't go and get a hot chocolate on",
          "We live in Calgary and I read about this in an article online. It seemed really interesting and I loved the story of how it came about. We decided to go during the day but I wish we had gone in the evening when it is all lit up. Although it is an interesting thing to go see",
          "This is a neat experience, admiring the skill in sculpting the ice & creation of the castle. We took our grandkids & my Granddaughter wore her Elsa dress so I could take photos of her. The grandkids loved it - our seventeen year old liked it but he was bored after about 10",
          "Awesome Ice castles! So worth the time to see and attend! it may be cold outside, but they have many fire burning containers to keep one warm... plus hor chocolate! A must see!",
          "Much better organized this year. Bigger and better. Honestly though last year we went during the day into twilight and it was better to view than at night. At night pictures suck you either get faces or the colors of the ice but not both. The sun on the ice was spectacular",
          "The ice castles are very pretty and really make the term winter wonderland come to life. The price is a little high for how small the exhibit is. It doesn't take very long to walk through and see everything which is disappointing. Younger children can enjoy playing on the ice",
          "Visiting the Ice Castles was a last minute plan I made before leaving Edmonton, and I'm glad I did! The pictures this place provides you with is astounding... I went during the night time when the lights were all on, and the whole place looked like it was straight out of a",
          "As Edmonton was the only Canadian location for Ice Castles, I was fortunate to be in town when it first opened. This attraction will appeal to people who value novel experiences or architecture. Best to see on a bright day when the ice sparkles or in the evening when the",
          "Worth a visit but make sure to go on a very cold day, when I went part of the place was melting! Apart from that they have very nice lighting as well fire performers when I went.",
          "The ice castles in an experience you will never forget..the vastness of the ice and colours from the lights make this a truly magical place!",
          "My family and I visited this past Friday while in Edmonton. We were looking for a family friendly activity in the evening before heading back to the hotel for a swim and bed time. Don't get me wrong... the ice castles were neat and I know a lot of work went into them, but the",
          "We went last year, and had to go again this year. It was so much bigger, and beautiful. The slides were way bigger, and they had a \"balcony\" to overlook the whole castle and park. Fun for couples, solo travelers, and families of all ages ! I'd suggest going just before the sun",
          "It was our first time at the ice castle in Edmonton and we found it enchanting. Beautiful lights shining through the ice, 2 ice slides, a place to grab a hot chocolate or a coffee, a few fun tunnels for the kids to climb through, and a spot with beautiful music playing. Kids 9",
          "Ice Castle (Edmonton) was a new experience to us. We are accustom to the winter living, but it was a different world when surrounded with huge icicles. Children were having so much fun on the sleds, People lined up to go down ice slides, or rushed to take photos by the",
          "We went last weekend and came from Calgary to see what the hype was all about. While it was cool to see, we felt it was way too over priced and little to explore. I agree with other reviews it would have been nice if there were more tunnels to walk through, rather than a large",
          "I thought the ice castles were very cool to see. Would have been even more spectacular at night but we went during the day. It was +5 degrees outside. Had lots of fun even after a long night out the night before!",
          "Absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend this for an evening out! Will go again next year!!!",
          "We enjoyed our evening at the Ice Castle. The lights behind the ice were beautiful, especially as they changed colours. The lights in the fountain at the centre of the display were coordinated to the music, which was fun. The warming fires were also a nice touch on a cold day.",
          "I was not impressed at all with these so called Ice Castles, nothing resembling a castle. First the tickets were $12 which was a bit high, but I am okay paying if it's worth it. We bought the tickets online on the company's very own website and were charged an additional $3.95",
          "This was my first time seeing the Edmonton Ice Castles. My partner and I went on one of the most bitterly cold evenings which actually turned out to be great because hardly anyone was there. To say it is an \"Ice Castle\" is very misleading, more like an \"Ice Courtyard\". I enjoyed",
          "Experienced this venue last night. With service charges the adult entry fee is close to $18. There is a lot of hype to intrigue people to attend, but the hype is not warranted. Essentially it is about 200 mounds of ice around the exterior with a few mounds scattered within."

There are hardly any statues or other artwork inside. I would say not worth the price, seeing it from outside is enough.",

I went around 6 ish and it was about 20 min wait to get it so be prepared to wait.",

          "Definitely a unique experience, worth doing at least once for you and your family.\n\nThey do a great job creating and maintaining the structures. Be sure to bring enough winter gear though, it's COLD! Haha",

          "Way better than expected. Definitely recommend going at night time... The lighting effects they use on all the ice is quite captivating. Our favorite part was probably the programmable LED light ice wall. The entire structure was much \u2026",
          "Magical. With coupon code, definitely worth it",
          "I have found a very cool place in Edmonton",
          "We had to go see the castle before they left and were not disappointed.  Every year is a unique experience and this one included a mysterious honeycomb like series of hallways and arches that were very fun to wander through.  The fire \u2026",
          "I attended on opening day for my second visit to the Ice Castle (first was last year). Once again I enjoyed it tremendously. It\u2019s a truly impressive structure made more beautiful by the spectacular lighting. Viewing it in the evening is a must because the lighting is amazing. A great place to spend an hour or two.",
          "Kinda neat. Worth a trip.",
          "The ice castles were beautiful, and made for great photos at night.  I recommend for both families and adults.  My only complaints are technical - We bought tickets online for 7:00pm and we waited in line for 15 minutes just to get in.  We \u2026",
          "Had a good time, fire show was fun to watch!!",
          "Definitely worth a visit when these are around! Beautiful. But don't forget to bundle up! If you want to leave there is no re-entry.",
          "The girl in the ticket window was the best",
          "Such a cool place to visit. Kid friendly and amusing for adults as well. Frozen slides have a height restriction and would reccomend wearing ski pants. There is a fire inside if your cold and the walls shelter you from the wind. Lights inside the ice look really cool as it gets darker outside.",
          "The ice castle itself was beautiful! I would highly recommend going at night, we went just before dark and it was immensely better the more contrast/the darker it got. There are slides inside which were quite fun, even as an adult, but I \u2026",
          "This was our second year attending and it was awesome. We went at night this year and it was an entirely different experience. The lights built into the ice were amazing and the kids couldn't get enough of the slides (I may have taken the slides once or twice myself \ud83d\ude0f). Will definitely return again next year.",
          "I don't want to say too much, but this was a really special, fun event. I highly recommend it. If you want to save some money and avoid the crowds, go during the week. I imagine it would be cool in the daytime as well.",
          "The ice castles were beautiful.  My daughter loved the ice slides.  We had a wonderful time exploring.  I'd like to see the ice castles at night.  We explored it this time during the day.  It would be nice if it was a little cheaper to see the ice castles.",
          "Interesting idea and pretty with the lights but not worth the $20 admission ($10 at most). Best part was the slidess - they were fun, though small. If you want to see it, go at night when the lights are on. We went about 1 hour before \u2026",
          "Amazing experience. Very beautiful but not much to do. Kid friendly but they might be a little bored. There's 3 slides that are all different sizes and a super cool fountain. There's also a firepit to warm your hands but it's not very accessible if you're under 5'\nOverall super cool though! An experience I'd recommend to anyone.",
          "It was cool to see for the first time. I imagine it would be more exciting with Children.",
          "It's beautiful and a unique experience! I'm always happy to find outdoor winter activities however it isn't cheap and a bit of a novelty experience; after about 30-40 minutes we were maxed on all you could do within the castles. Photos turned out great!",
          "Nice place for kids to have fun in winter time. It was a unique experience.",
          "Nice atmosphere fun for the children the price was a little much 70 dollars for a family of 4 for about an hour of entertainment.  Defiantly wear toques and gloves at a minimum.   Nice walking path with snow sculptures.",
          "We drove 4 hours to get here and bought tickets online for 6 but didn't \u2018t get to see the Ice Castle last night because they were closed for February 1. Bought tickets again today, hoping we get to see it.\ud83d\ude14",
          "Super fun cant wait to go again this year!",
          "Highly recommend as a casual night out with friends and family. The ice castle is a legit attraction with ice sculptures, light installations and an ice slide for all ages. Make sure you dress for the weather and wear comfortable shoes as the crushed ice floor kinda feels like walking on a sandy beach. You'll enjoy it no doubt.",
          "Amazing Ice Castle this year! We were really impressed by the size and details of the castle. I was last at the Ice Castle back in January 2016 and I was blown away with how much larger the castle is compared to when they first came to \u2026",
          "Even all properly dressed up for  - 35\u00b0 weather, this place is incredibly enjoyable and entertaining. The slides, the castle and all the little nooks and crannies. Even had the pleasure of watching the artists carve their snow figures!! Will Continue to go every year! And had to thank our friends for the free ticket entry\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Should be called the Slide Castles. Barely any ice sculptures when I went.",
          "Price is high for what there is. A little disappointed.",
          "Great experience, was really cool to see and the slides were fun. It's a bit smaller than expected. Would be nice if they had an actual ice maze, or perhaps a large closed in area with more things to sit on/cubbies but honestly I enjoyed \u2026",
          "Not bad. Little pricy for what it is. Kids dig it though.",
          "Very beautiful ice castles.",
          "Nothing special. Yea it does light up pretty cool. But that's about it. A few sculptures inside had huge line ups, so if you want to take a picture in the chair you have to wait for 20 min. Good for a one time visit, don't think we'll be back there agian",
          "Had a great time will visiting this place, be sure to buy tickets in advance as they tend to be very busy on weekends. A lot of neat little areas divided around almost like little chambers but no ceiling.  We visited it during the day \u2026",
          "We've gone to the ice castle last year as well as this year. Both experiences were fantastic (once during the day and the other at night). The castle was stunning and well worth the wait! The staff both times were extremely pleasant!",
          "Was a ton of fun! \nDress warm if you plan on being there a while. \nThe workers seemed to be a bit off but they're in the cold so no foul!",
          "Very cool as always! The slides were fun and the staff very friendly. There didn't seem to be as many interesting formations this year. The \"crystal wall\" was very cool.  The \"maze\" portion was too narrow for people passing in opposite directions and there were constant streams of people which made you stuck in one spot for a while.",
          "It was alright. Honestly expected it to be bigger and the price for admin is too much in my opinion for something that takes 20mins to walk around",
          "It was fun and interesting to visit and my little kids loved the slides...but it's a little pricey for an hour or so of entertainment for the family. It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to walk through it, the rest is just the slides and \u2026",
          "Very pretty and amazing. It wasn't very big but that would be a positive if you had young children with you. The slides and fire dancers definitely enhanced the experience.",
          "The ice castle was really neat, but there was very little to do, you could walk through the entire thing in less than 30 minutes. They had 3 different slides and some photo ops, but definitely not an all day or even an full afternoon activity",
          "This facility is not as family friendly as they would like you to think.\n\nMy 15 month old daughter was getting a little bit cold and standing by their fire pit wasn\u2019t warming her up so I decided to take her back to the vehicle to warm her \u2026",
          "Always breathtaking views and amazing ice carvings all over the castles. I go there every time and usually try to be in during the opening season. I love Ice Castles. Keep coming back to Edmonton. :)",
          "Fun place, happy hearts and faces",
          "Was cold. But is nice because then she was forced to cuddle me to stay warm. Excellent place to go if you was to get intimate. Recommend to show up close to the end of your time slot so you are not in the cold. You can stay as long as you \u2026",
          "Magical place, beautiful scenery. I can\u2019t wait to revisit next winter.",
          "Super cute for pictures and kids",
          "Great spot for pictures! Kinda short for the price. Please take a good camera! The multiple types of slides were pretty cool for any age!",
          "A lot of fun! Tapped into our inner kid and enjoyed the slides, passage ways, and lights. Would recommend for all ages.",
          "Such a beautiful sight to see",
          "Yesterday, my boyfriend and I ventured to the YEG Ice Castles. We were lucky and chose to go during a non-deep freeze day. however it was still very very chilly (obviously surrounded by ice).. \nLast year, we went at night and this year we decided to go during the day.  I loved the display during the day. Definitely go and dress warm!!!",
          "It is OK to visit once, but I don't see it staying every winter for the price they ask. $55-70 for the family of 3-4 is way too much for 20-30 minutes of fun. I was hoping there will be Elisa and Anna, as others described. It can justify \u2026",
          "The Ice Castles is an annual event in Winter. It\u2019s a must go for visitors or residents. I\u2019ve been there twice in three years. Visiting during sunset is supposed to be pretty to take great pictures. It\u2019s important to say that is very cold inside the castles, so go dressed properly.",
          "If you have an evening free i would totally recommend going to enjoy the ice castles. They are beautiful not too costly and a great night out with the family.",
          "A refreshing, fun place for winter activities",
          "Never seen anything like them & will certainly go again",
          "Such a great experience!",
          "Wasn't really worth the $13-$17 you pay for entry. No cool ice sculptures of bears or anything other than one ice sculpted bench. Hot chocolate and expensive mini donuts are outside on your way out. Would recommend if you enjoy watching small children fall down, or small children on slides.",
          "It's a cool place",
          "The ice castles were awesome this evening (Feb 18, 2019).  The largest of rooms is not as tall as I remember from 2018 but the ice slides are really good this year.",
          "My boyfriend is on exchange here for school this year and he said that the Ice Castles were an amazing \"must see\". Definitely recommend wrapping up warmer than you think, but we really enjoyed our time.",
          "Utterly amazing! Didn't think you could get so creative with ice. The light show brought a whole new dimension to the experience. Second time going and it certainly wont be the last",
          "Lovely concept. All 'castles' made of water and icicles. A couple slides for kids, be aware of the cold (drained my cell battery in a matter of minutes)",
          "Awesome...cool...fun",
          "It was really awesome. There were ice slides which were cool. The fire show wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be though.",
          "I believe they a look chunkier than last year",
          "Great as usual. This year we caught the festival as well, good timing. Was a great time with the family!",
          "We went at 6pm on a Sunday. It was very crowded to the point where you couldn't get decent photos and would be nice if they had more than 1 food truck outside the event however the ice castles were beautiful and worth seeing. Might go back during the day when it is less packed.",
          "Beautiful!! A must see",
          "One of my favourite place in Edmonton",
          "Very cool experience.",
          "It was alot of fun and so beautiful totally worth the time to go there. Will go again it's very mystical friendly staff, ice slides fun for all ages. You definitely leave happy.",
          "It is nice to visit once. I thought it would be bigger so I wish it would be bigger. Spend 30 mins to take my time to make my money and driving worth while. On an outdoor at night -22c can be super cold tho. For me it is a YOLO.",
          "Got tickets as a gift. This was more fun than we expected. My 4 year old had a blast going down the ice slides",
          "I love the experience. Hoping for a nice music in the background to make the experience more magical and exciting.",
          "Gorgeous. Unique and refreshing experience for those visiting Edmonton. We loved the dancing lights, slides & fire. It would be neat to bring coffee/ HC in, perhaps thay can add that on the inside/ like a hot chocolate bar /lounge. Ice puns are appreciated! Definitely worth the cold to see this beauty!",
          "Honestly, it\u2019s not worth the price we\u2019ve paid. The staff are very organized, this year they have three slides, the Castle is beautiful inside and out, but it does get crowded and wait times for a slide can be long. I suggest choosing to go \u2026",
          "Beautiful every time! Be prepared for the cold weather as the snow underneath chills your toes first. Look for the ice made into slides, a chair/throne, a maze of tunnels and pathways, a wall of changing lights, and the little firepit to warm up by.",
          "Great place. Did not dress very well, so I couldn't spend much time inside. So please dress warm\ud83d\ude00",
          "Beautiful and unique experience! Wear good shoes and dress warmly. Nicer at night with all the lights on.",
          "In Edmonton for a work-related event. Thought I would check out the Ice Castles. The place would be totally fun for little kids to play in. Lots of ice slides and cool colours",
          "Not worth the price. We paid $90 for a family of 5 and stayed there for just 20mins. There's no \"Wow\" effect inside. There's nothing you can do as an adult, aside from posing for pictures. You will just get the same background inside from \u2026",
          "We go every year. I prefer to go in the daytime to see all the ice. We loved the tunnels and made this year. Thanks anna and Elsa for making an appearance.",
          "Beautiful! We spent about an hour inside. There are many little spots to check out. A great date night event or outing with the family.",
          "very nice place even adults can slide on the ice. tried it once. just wear sufficient clothes it's freezing cold. best at night",
          "Awsome experience!",
          "We had a fabulous time at the Edmonton ice castles. We had a multi-generational family outing, and everyone from the 3 and 5 year-old kids to the 55 year old grand parents had a blast. Even us 30 year old middle generation went on the ice \u2026",
          "Really cool! \ud83d\ude02 There are several slides and a nice fire pit warm-up area. Worth the visit!",
          "A great spot on a nice sunny day.",
          "Very neat! Larger than expected. Go early to avoid lines or buy tickets online. Ground is like sand so bring boots and a sled (leave the stroller and wheeled wagons at home).",
          "The Edmonton Ice Castles are neat. In my opinion,  for the cost, it is not worth it. When you buy tickets, make sure you find and apply the Ice Castles promo code. This is one of those see it once and never again kind of thing.",
          "It was... okay. This was our third time over four years and it felt like nothing new. There was a long wait for tickets despite pre-paying. The advertised fire show never started. The igloos were the only new thing. \n\nThis is definitely \u2026",
          "I would reccomend to visit this beautiful castle.  Slides a bit owercrouded but not too bad. Make sure you have good winter shoes because snow inside is about 6in deep constantly, because they keep crashing it to  prevent compaction . Also It is not huge.",
          "Nice idea. Good to see once but expensive. Seems like a waste of city water.",
          "Great experience, be prepared with an extra layer of clothing, it is cold!",
          "Feature wall was cool, slides for kids. \nHad a fire for warmth. Didn't see the fire dancers though.",
          "Really enjoyed the ice castles, wonderful place to take some great fun pictures. Loved the lights in the ice. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Gorgeous place with lit up ice formations",
          "Thenicecastles were pretty cool, the details in the ice castles were intricate. It was nice that there were other activities around the ice castles that kept us occupied for the afternoon.",
          "Peaceful walks",
          "Took my child to play in the castle - she loved the ice slides, and of course, they had actors as Anna and Else from the movie Frozen on site (which she also enjoyed).  Relatively small attraction, though - you can probably get through the entire thing in an hour (or so).",
          "If you've never been it's worth the visit. Make sure to dress for the weather to get the most out of it and book in advance. Each year it seems to be bigger and better.",
          "It is a good spot to visit as one - time for my view. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Our first time and was a good visit.",
          "Good food.  I love that they roast their beef and turkey in house.  Reasonable prices.  Parking is limited so plan to arrive early.",
          "Great place and there is stuff for kids and adults. Next year I'll try to go in the evening as they have led lighting inside the ice",
          "Like the ice carving but not that big. Good for kids and for someone who love to explore and try new things.",
          "Very interesting activities",
          "Excellent place from adults to child to visit! Book online to save money. Going direct costs you almost double. I had to pay $20 CAD, while online booking was $13 CAD.",
          "It's great experience to move around through the ice walls and through the ice caves. Artificial creation but interesting to visit.",
          "Really cool experience",
          "Our children absolutely loved this attraction. They could have spent an entire day playing inside if they could have. \nThere was a beautiful water fountain right in the middle of it all that really surprised me. All the lights hidden inside \u2026",
          "Place is well build lots nice background for picture.the only draw back is they are not strict with winter gear they only focus on waiver. What i am saying in because it ice its slippery they should have a walk way thats not covered with ice or they provide something to put on the shoes to prevent slipping.",
          "Wonderful wonderful event! Fun and original ice sculptures, slides for kids, fire for parents. Visited in -20 and the kids didn't even notice how cold it was. Spent just over an hour there, it's not a big place but very much worth it. Well organized too.",
          "Beautiful!!\nLots of fun, people very friendly.\nWe easily spent an hour here and could have stayed longer!",
          "Was neat to see but I expected it to be bigger for the cost? Neat to see once but wouldn\u2019t spend money to go again.",
          "Cold inside! Wear more plz. It is a small castle but a good place to take photos.",
          "The ice castles in the winter are always fun to visit and see! Very calming and breathtaking. The staff are always wonderful.",
          "It was fantastic.",
          "I recommend to visit Ice Castles in Edmonton , Alberta - Canada \nAstounding built in Hawrelak Park , Remarkable most popular events .\nAll Stars.",
          "Excellent and cold",
          "Had good fun! Took around 30min to get through - had 3 slides this year and we lined up for one. Felt like a kid with those crazy carpets",
          "So Awsome! Wished we hadn't gone on the coldest night ever lol. Absolutely beautiful very impressed. Friendly caring staff! Thanks guys\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Omg fun",
          "Really cool place, kids had a lot of fun on the slides. It's a bit small, but a solid 30-40 minutes of fun.",
          "There are No Ice Castles in the middle of August though there was a wee bit of a wind chilling effect to go with the rain.",
          "I love going there. Fun place. Great place for taking photos",
          "One of the coolest things to do in #yeg in the winter! Great spot for a date night, and don't forget to bring your skates after for a quick lap on the pond!",
          "Gorgeous beautiful magical fairly inexpensive family outing! Could lower the price a bit. It's a touch high unless you get the early bird email.",
          "They are a good 1 time experience. Did expect more but not bad",
          "We had a lot of fun at the Ice Castles. I recommend wearing snow pants.",
          "It is good if you are in the area, entrance is a tad high for what you get. Good for photos and maybe an hour. Better for kids. Bring skates for the near by skating area.",
          "Excellent winter experience",
          "Great place. But can't stay for long time. It is really very cold",
          "Be fully prepared for cold if you wanted to visit this place. Although it was fun",
          "An amazing experience! It's a real piece of art and fun at the same time.",
          "I really enjoyed this stunning display. So many interesting places to take photos. The atmosphere is very soothing and the staff are so very helpful. I loved all of the interesting facts and information there staff has to share. Very well \u2026",
          "Second year in a row attending the Ice Castle in Hawrelak Park and glad I did. Purchased tickets through the pre-sale so they were a bit cheaper. Different layout and more features than last years\u2019 Castle.",
          "Look great from The outside but do to warm weather we could not go inside since we were from out of town  we won't have a chance to see it this year",
          "The ice castles are a must visit in Edmonton during the winter. They change every year, so I think it is worth going back even if you have been. You can book your time slot online, so you don't have to wait in long lines. It can even be booked for private sessions, like photo shoots. \nJust remember to dress warm!",
          "Awesome place to check out. I went when it was -25c, still had fun.",
          "It was fun, not sure I like how they had only certain times to enter, seemed a bit weird when there was no tour or show.",
          "Cool place. The music and medleys they play over the speakers when I went is pretty majestic and fitting. The actual ice castles are beautiful, but I agree it's sort of just ice. It's definitely nice to go try it out though :)",
          "absolutely beautiful! price is a bit steep, 20$ per person on the weekend, i dont know if its worth 20$ but it is absolutely stunning and an amazing experience.",
          "Amazing place. Make sure you dress very very warm.",
          "It's a great place to go with family or a date. Go around sunset to get the best of both worlds.",
          "The ice castle is a wonderful place for a winter date. While you can certainly see it all in 10 minutes if you wanted to, it is best enjoyed if you take some time to relax and take in all the details of the structure. Of course this \u2026",
          "Absolutely gorgeous, but a bit over-priced for the weekend especially considering the most you'll probably spend here is an hour or so.",
          "Very beautiful!",
          "It was very impressive and the setting was quite majical on a cold winter evening, however I left wondering if there should have been more to it.",
          "Great place for all ages. Slides for the kids and an incredible structure to explore",
          "What an amazing structure, I was taken here for a suprise and it did not disappoint. Every corner revealed something spectacular and would recommend people going to see it.",
          "Such a fun visit. We were amazed by the beauty and enjoyed thebfamily friendly environment and the slides",
          "Love it. Too cold so make sure dress properly. Try to go during night",
          "Was worth the weekday price we paid for our tickets online. Tickets get sent to your iPhone wallet- so handy! Friendly staff and beautiful  creations. Spent about an hour taking photos with our cameras. Got the perfect 4:30-5:00 entrance. Just before a bulk of people arrived and sunset shots \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "My kids really enjoyed it and it was fun activity for the whole family",
          "Magical! So lovely. Memories made and great photo ops.",
          "This method of castle construction while sturdy seems vulnerable to fire. Hopefully there are no Dragons.",
          "If you like spending money on ice that you can normally  see for free in edmonton on the streets  starting in Nov ending in March this is the place for you. spent $14 to see colored ice and only one food truck. I only reccomend if you have small kids and want to waste 30 mins.",
          "Thanks for all the work that goes into it! It's beautiful \ud83d\udc96",
          "It is a small area but the work put in to create something like this is impeccable",
          "Wow! What an experience! We were totally blown away! Definitely woth the visit!",
          "It's cold, but fun. A unique experience, beautiful!",
          "Amazing but dress in layers...",
          "Very good experience...",
          "Had such a fantastic time experiencing this very cool place \ud83d\ude0a",
          "The castle was beautiful and it had some wonderful features inside.",
          "Loved the ice castle! Beautiful and fun for all ages. There are little surprises and different views from every corner. Highly recommend going to see this.",
          "Lots of fun, the slides were a hit but for older kids only.  Parking was a breeze, unlike other events at Hawrelak.",
          "Very good and unique experience. You should 100% go at night though.",
          "Nice experience but we showed up on time for 3pm which we were scheduled for and then had to stand in line for 20 minutes.\n\nTake your kids.",
          "A little smaller than expected - but a surreal amazing experience.",
          "The 3 slides this year were a nice bonus for the kids.",
          "Magical place to spend an hour or two. A different experience during the day and at night. Make sure to pre-book your tickets online to reserve your visit window. This year the castle features an ice throne, multiple slides, an ice fountain \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is an art museum in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The museum occupies a 8,000 square metres (86,000 sq ft) building at Churchill Square in downtown Edmonton. The museum building was originally designed by Donald G. Bittorf, and B. James Wensley, although portions of that structure were  demolished or built over during a redevelopment of the building by Randall Stout.\nThe art museum was established in 1924 as the Edmonton Museum of Arts. In 1956 the museum was renamed the Edmonton Art Gallery. The museum occupied a number of location from its establishment in 1924 to 1969. The museum was relocated to its present location, and reopened to the public in 1969 at the Brutalist Arthur Blow Condell building. In 2005, the museum was renamed Art Gallery of Alberta. From 2007 to 2010, the art museum underwent a C$88 million redevelopment of its building. The redeveloped building was reopened to the public on January 31, 2010.\nIts collection includes over 6,000 works, with a focus on art produced in Alberta, and other parts of western Canada. In addition to exhibiting its permanent collection, the museum also hosts travelling exhibitions and offers public education programs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum was established in 1924 as the Edmonton Museum of Arts, with a mandate to promote fine arts, and preserve historical relics from the region. The institution was established after Maud Bowman, the museums founding director and president enlisted the support of the Edmonton Art Club, and several other business, and political leaders.The museum held its first exhibition in the Palm Room of the Hotel Macdonald, with work on loan from local collections that included members of the Edmonton Art Club in addition to 24 works on loan from the National Gallery of Canada collection. Growth of the museum's collection was slowed during the 1930s and 1940s, as a result of the Great Depression and the Second World War. During this period, the museum maintained a number of art education classes, as well as exhibiting works on loan from the National Gallery of Canada.In the first half of the 20th century, the museum occupied various sites including a former Edmonton Public Library building, and the fourth floor of the Civic Block and the Edmonton Motors; building before settling into the former home of Richard Secord in 1952. Recognizing that the majority of its collection, and exhibition activities were in the area of fine arts, the institution opted to change its name to the Edmonton Art Gallery in 1956.Efforts to construct a purpose-built facility for the art museum began in 1962, after A. E. Condell bequeathed funds to the museum on behalf of her son, Arthur Blow Condell. Designs by architects Donald G. Bittorf, and B. James Wensley were chosen for the building, with the City of Edmonton donating 2,400 square metres (0.59 acres) at Churchill Square for the site of the new building. The building was opened in 1969, and was named the \"Arthur Blow Condell Memorial Building\". Further renovations to the building in 1977 saw the creation a new wing, replacing an exterior courtyard.\n\nProposals to renovate the building were made in June 1998, although serious discussions about its funding did not begin until 2001. In 2005, the museum launched an architectural competition, with 27 architects submitting applications. In September 2005, the designs from Los Angeles-based architect Randall Stout was chosen as the winning design for the museum. The redevelopment doubles the exhibition space within its structure, as well as provided an off-site storage site for its collection. On the same day the winning design was announced, the museum was renamed the Art Gallery of Alberta, in an effort to reflect its expanding focus on art from all of Alberta.In April 2007, the Arthur Blow Condell building was partially demolished with significant portions of the existing structure incorporated into Stout's design. Construction of the new building formally began in June 2007. The museum was closed to the public from March 2007 to January 2010 in order to facilitate the construction of the new building; with museum exhibiting its collection in a former Hudson's Bay Company property at Enterprise Square from April 2007 to December 2009. The museums inaugural exhibitions after the renovation included: Edgar Degas: Figures in Motion; Karsh: Image Maker; and The Murder of Crows, the North American premiere of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's sound installation. After the museum reopened on 31 January 2010, annual memberships of to the Art Gallery of Alberta increased, with the museum seeing 30,000 visitors within the first six weeks of reopening.In December 2009, the museum and the National Gallery of Canada issued a joint press release announcing a three-year partnership, which saw the use of the Art Gallery of Alberta's galleries to exhibit works from the National Gallery's collection. The program was the first \"satellite program\" between the National Gallery of Canada, and another art museum.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe property is located at Churchill Square, a public square in downtown Edmonton. The building takes up an area of 8,000 square metres (86,000 sq ft), including 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft) of climate-controlled exhibition spaces. The building was designed by Randall Stouts Architects, Inc., from Los Angeles and San Francisco. Local architects and engineering firms HIP Architects, Stantec, BPTEC Engineering, and Read Jones Christoffersen assisted Randall Stout's design team; while Ledcor Group of Companies provided construction management for the project. The original budget for the renovation was C$48 million, although it was later increased to C$88 million.The patinated zinc and stainless steel design was intended to demonstrate the museum's \"commitment to contemporary art\".  The exterior of the building features a 190 metres (620 ft) steel ribbon, intended to represent the North Saskatchewan River, and the aurora, geographical phenomenons and features of Edmonton. The building's interior also features an \"aurora\" inspired room. The building includes a restaurant, espresso bar, gift shop, and an educational facility with a 150-seat theatre known as the Singhmar Centre for Art Education. The building includes a rooftop patio known as the City of Edmonton Terrace. The building also includes rental spaces for the public, such as Manning Hall.The originally structure on the property that was used by the museum, the Arthur Blow Condell building, was opened in 1969 with designs from Donald G. Bittorf, and B. James Wensley. The Brutalist-styled building was partially demolished in 2007 to accommodate the reconstruction of the building. However, approximately 67 per cent of the older museum structure was retained during the reconstruction, with most of the retained portions used as the new building's foundation, or lower floors. The new building's third floor terrace was the roof of the Arthur Blow Condell building.\n\n\n== Permanent collection ==\n\nThe museum's permanent collection features over 6,000 works, the majority of which were produced after the 1950s. Many of these works were acquired by the museum through private and public donors. The museum's collection has an emphasis on art that was produced in Alberta, or western Canada. The museum's permanent collection began in 1924, although its growth was slowed during the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the Great Depression and the Second World War. From the 1960s to the 1985, the museum's focused its acquisition efforts on paintings and sculptures of modern art. In 2015, the museum's permanent collection was valued at approximately C$30 million. In 2017 the museum received $375,000 to acquire works by contemporary First Nations, Inuit and Metis artists for their permanent collection from the Canada Council for the Arts\u2019 New Chapter program.The museum's collection of historical Canadian art includes works by Jack Bush, Emily Carr, Henry George Glyde, Illingworth Kerr, Cornelius Krieghoff, Pegi Nicol MacLeod, James Wilson Morrice, Marion Nicoll, Paul Peel, Bill Reid, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Carl Schaefer, Lilias Torrance Newton, and members of the Group of Seven.The museum's collection of modern and contemporary art feature works by Canadian artists including Robert Boyer, Janet Cardiff, Chris Cran, Marlene Creates, Dean Drever, Aganetha Dyck, Douglas Haynes, Alex Janvier, Brian Jungen, Rita Letendre, Amy Malbeuf, Liz Magor, Lyndal Osborne, Jane Ash Poitras, and Takao Tanabe.The museum's collection of photographs was started in 1977, and presently has over 1,500 photographs. The museum's collection of photographs includes historical photographs by Edward Curtis, Karl Blossfeldt, Walker Evans, and Yousuf Karsh, and contemporary photographs by Lynne Cohen, and William Eakin. The museum also maintains a prints collection that includes over 850 works by Thomas Bewick.\n\n\n=== Selected works ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe museum is affiliated with the Alberta Museum Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, the Canadian Museums Association, and the Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHill, Kate (2014).

          "I visited it during family day, I was a little lost, but I liked the exhibits and the fact that the gallery had people explaining some of the exhibits",
          "An incredible, unique structure, inside and out. The architectural tour gives a great insight to the structure of the building. Very impressive. Each floor offers Interesting, creative, thought provoking displays. Definitely worth the visit to the Art Gallery. Extremely",
          "I liked the buildings the most. It was really modern and it stood out! There were orthodox icons. Kids could be tourists for tots. We had the possibility to buy. Worthwhile to see!",
          "The creative design of the Alberta Art Gallery that became a signature of Edmonton attract visitors by its architecture. But the inside is no less outstanding. The world class exhibits and shows. Excellent high end dining experience in a fashionable design and pleasant",
          "Some intriguing art exhibits, last one I saw offered to take my facebook profile and show me more..good for young interested kids also.",
          "We took our grandkids expecting static galleries of paintings and instead were immersed in interactive displays and modalities that challenged our interpretations of art galleries. Our two young grandchildren asked questions, tried hands on experiences and had a thoroughly",
          "This gallery is doing a disservice to people that could potentially get into art otherwise. I visited about a year ago and the exhibits were interesting. Not my thing at all, as I don't like abstract art, but it was a nice mixture of paintings, photographs, and even the",
          "A stylish exterior held little to please inside. We enjoyed one exhibit travelling through time on indigenous issues. Otherwise the space held little of interest for us. We would have preferred to give this a miss and spend more time at the nearby museum.",
          "It is a lovely building, but the exhibits were underwhelming to say the least. Our admission cost was reduced as only 2 exhibits were open (I think only one was closed) but it was still too much. I felt like I was at a University show-and-tell type exhibit, not art.",
          "I've been wanting to come here since it opened. The building is absolutely gorgeous. I'll admit, thought, that I was confused by the lack of what I understood to be art (cue the people saying I don't know art). I expected more paintings and sculptures and that kind of thing.",
          "Horrible. Art is subjective, I get that. But seriously... give me a break. The staff were horrible and super pretentious!! Don\u2019t go. Walk around Edmonton and see amazing free art. Don\u2019t bother paying monies for The BS at Alberta Gallery of Art. Horrible. Horrible.",
          "Nice exhibits around here and the place is incredible. I love this place and the staff is so nice!!!",
          "It was a great experience. Its a silent and beautiful place. I enjoyed Art by so many different artists. Great work.",
          "An excellent multi projector display of William Kerridge's \"Procession\", with wonderful audio, is currently on display on Level 3. \"Cul-de-Sac\" on Level 1 had some interesting architectural designs for new communities. I found the remaining displays uninspiring. There seem to",
          "Architecture is iconic for the region. Exhibits are not. A mural size photograph of plowed snow in a mall parking lot is not art. A woman undressing behind a sheet has been played since the 60s. The genital shots...seen the same in Montreal and Quebec City...nothing new.",
          "this a great place to bring your students , according to my students they throughly enjoyed the stop here , as there were some hands on workshops that they were happy to [participate in",
          "When we visited the AGA, the first thing that impressed us was the building itself, a very interesting design and structure. One of the first showings we experienced was an art showing of modern landscape art that was fascinating in stretching the bounds of what most people",
          "The building itself is beautiful. I've been three times and have only once seen an exhibit (Karsh photography) that I found interesting. Maybe the exhibits are of interest to people who are particularly passionate about art. As a member of the general public who knows very",
          "Granted it was a free visit, but the fact that there were not that many interesting art works made the whole visit pointless! Needless to say that we cut our trip short after half an hour!",
          "I love art. I thought the museum was cool. Price was reasonable. My 10 year old loved it she thought the hologram was aweosme.",
          "Went here twice, 2014 and 2015 . Very unique displays of artwork. Also they changed their artwork between my visits. Both times were great. Prices are decent and it wasn\u2019t very busy. My favourite art gallery so far.",
          "average place and wasted space. I want to be wowed but the exhibitions are just average. Good thing my other museum pass got me in free.",
          "This was a lovely afternoon activity on my own while in town for the first time. The exhibits where well displayed, thoughtfully curated and delightful to look at.",
          "Great architecture. I am so disappointed on what there was- such a waste of potentially good Space. Colossally disappointed",
          "A few hours spent for a good history review, culture sensitivity and interactive displays. Something for everyone, children's pavilion, bug pavilion, lots of seating areas and a snack area before you move on",
          "I had really wanted to visit AGA for some time - but, sadly, now that I've seen it I've been left underwhelmed (I have never said that about any art gallery that I have visited before - and I've seen some unusual ones over the years). If you can delay your visit, wait until next",
          "I took my friend from Norway to this gallery. The most impressive part was the building itself. Only 2 floors open so we paid a reduced rate . Very little was on display that was truly interesting ( this is both of our opinions) . We spent more time exploring the gift shop which",
          "Expected to see some paintings from past artist like Dali, Rembrandt, Monet, etc... None were available. The new art was small and unexciting.",
          "Fabulous opportunity to see different installations. Each has a different feel and some I liked some I didn't but they all made me think. Once I was done it was nice to have a cool drink on the patio.",
          "When we visited the 2.floor was closed due an up coming new exhibition. We mainly visited to view modern art, and didn\u2019t find much interesting.",
          "So much to see here. It was invigorating, inspiring, and interesting! My friend and I spent a few hours and could have easily spent another!! Will definitely go again.",
          "It's a beautiful building, architecturally. I expected there to be more gallery space. DD liked it, and found the main gallery to be the most interesting. I also liked the space for an artist in residence, to see someone creating something. But overall I was disappointed there",
          "I enjoy the variety of presentation which helps me step outside of my comfort zone of art appreciation. I do learn from the presentations. I renewed my membership to encourage more frequent visits.",
          "I was in and out of here in twenty minutes, an entire floor was closed which I guess could have effected this - however the floors that were open had hardly anything worth spending a lot of time on. While a nice gallery, I really expected more from such an extravagant building",
          "We should be more frequent visitors as different artists are featured. It is a great context for the art work. Very relaxing visit",
          "My granddaughter was visiting Edmonton and wanted to see the city of Edmonton's ART Gallery We were excited about our visit. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. Only the first and third floors were open. The main part of the gallery has always been on the third",
          "This wonderful art gallery in downtown Edmonton is a must visit. The building is very modern and a perfect setting for all the great artists who showcase their works. It is so quiet and comforting to stroll through this awesome gallery and to see the works of some of the",
          "As director of the Edmonton Art Gallery, Tony Lupino did a very good job curating worthwhile exhibitions. Since getting rid of its distinctive modern brutalist appearance and EAG name the exhibitions are mediocre, with a sprinkling of pieces on tour from Canada's National Art",
          "It does have a Frank Gehry-like feel and it both swoops and soars. It is appropriate that is a showcase for art has a distinctive and decorative style. The presentation of art has morphed from representative depictions of the world, through abstract to multimedia and sometimes",
          "This was a treat to see. The striking architecture brings you in from the street and with its large, open and curvy interior space makes this an enjoyable visit. I started at the top (third floor) by taking the elegant stair case (they have elevators). They have a small cafe",
          "First time for my wife and I. Really enjoyed a couple of exhibits. Would like to return when there are new exhibits.",
          "Not one of the better art galleries, bizarre rather than interesting. Lots of other interesting places to visit in Edmonton, this isn\u2019t one of them.",
          "We liked the museum. Went there Monday afternoon and the staff was very friendly. The building is great, but honestly our favorite thing was the restaurant. Highly recommend. A well worth visit.",
          "I took advantage of free admission through my employer and had a nice afternoon visiting the gallery. Very easy to access using the train. There are so many photo ops here. The gift shop carries an interesting variety of items.",
          "This is not a huge museum, and it does not have a permanent collection on display, as does the Glenbow in Calgary. However, its temporary shows are usually worth seeing. More than anything else, the building itself is a work of art, as is the Guggenheim in Bilbao, by the same",
          "We recently had a family members wedding at The Edmonton Art Gallery. In short, the venue itself is beautiful and we had very high hopes for a great wedding. The gallery offers much choice in set up and an awesome location. Our HUGE disappointment was the catering. The",
          "I had a lovely visit to the art gallery. Each exhibit gave different feelings and vibes! The Peter von Thiesenhausen exhibit was absolutely moving and epic. Loved my visit and left feeling very inspired! A must-see in Edmonton.",
          "nice that women are finally recognized for the contribution to the art world. disappointed in write ups always mention marriage status, children and other jobs while for male artist this is not even mentioned. we are not sure if this was conscience decision by the art gallery.",
          "Depends on your expectations, you will find it there: gift shop, kid's activity centre, some hands on interactive activities, historical, Canadian, Indigenous, modern, recycled,.... It is all a matter of what shifts in perspective you are willing to experience. Only 2 floors",
          "Like most other Albertan museums this one fell in the same category of BOOOOOORRRRIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGG. A lot of the rooms and exhibits were not very modern and far and few between. Lots of spread out space in between but of course the building is very impressive. I couldn't wait",
          "Good lord where do I begin?! Being someone who has an extensive background in art & art history that has traveled many parts of the world & visited many museums & galleries....the only sound that comes to mind is \u201cUgh!\u201d A beautiful building filled with mediocrity. If art is",
          "The AGA is a haven for creatives in the city, they throw awesome theme parties and show cool contemporary art. I've been to several talks, tours or film screenings there that I enjoyed as well. Check it out!",
          "The museum is kinda small, but the building is really nice. I like that they really support local artist, so it is a must-go for anyone who likes art and is not familiar with Canadian artists.",
          "The building is great architecturally, designed by a student of Geary. Much of the art on display is by indigenous artists. I would like to see a wider array, but I can appreciate the gallery's decision to go in this direction. Keeping in mind that Edmonton is not a huge",
          "Ever since my first visit to Edmonton's Art Gallery in 2009 I loved it! I make a point of going at least 3 limes a year to see the new art pieces. The building is interesting and a piece of art itself. They have a gift shop, coat check and lockers available, and a cafe inside.",
          "Visited AGA for the first time this past weekend and was actually very pleasantly surprised. Beautiful building and not only from the outside - the \u201csnail shell\u201d continues inside! Very interesting! There\u2019s 3 levels with a coat room, nice washrooms, small gift shop on the ground",
          "And the shape of the art gallery for the visit and see for of the alberta and the service And neat for the people who are disabilities or not",
          "I visit this art gallery on an almost monthly basis. They have free nights Tuesday's and Wendsday's and it is amazing. They layout of the gallery is really well thought out and the archetiture is gorgeous. The staff there are amunst the nicest they are always really welcoming",
          "Greatly enjoyed this gallery, especially the current exhibits. Greatly enjoyed the tour through the Globe and Mail photography files; and the Warhol Gretzky images were entertaining. Top of the list was the second floor exhibit celebrating indigenous art and history in the",
          "Loved the Art Gallery of Alberta. Amusing architecture designed building. Many different art displayed inside from local artists and artist from other Canadian cities. My wife and I visited the Art Gallery last year",
          "I love art. Plan and simple. I recognize that not all art is loved by everyone but I appreciate art on many levels. The museum, while an architectural beauty leaves much to be desired in substance. Who ever the curator is, needs a reality check. There is all this amazing space",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed spending four hours in this art gallery today. Especially enjoyed the gallery depicting the history of Canada in art and photographs, and the news photography. Beautiful building, relaxing place to enjoy art.",
          "The Art Gallery of Alberta is a must see if only for the building itself. The walls swoop and curve and create a wonderful aesthetic. The art installations are rotated every so often so it is hard to predict if there will be something to interest everyone on any given day. We",
          "This was my first time going to an art gallery & I only went because my 16 year-old daughter wanted to go for her birthday. I am very happy that she expanded my world! The gallery was amazing & we had a very good time. It took us about an hour and a half to complete all three",
          "I found the exhibits to be a bit disappointing. The biennial artist exhibit had some interesting pieces and some pretty put there. There was very little of the permanent collection on display though they were setting up one area which wasn't open. The building is very nice",
          "My girlfriend and I started off our evening at the art gallery. We spent an hour and a half wandering around the two floors that were open. The third floor was closed to move in a new exhibit. I probably wouldn't like paying full price to go, so take advantage of the free",
          "I visited this gallery with one of my friends in the morning. It was not crowded at all and the addmission was free for students. There is a coffee shop at the top floor with a few chairs outside on the roof, it is a little pricy but it worth it to order a coffee to enjoy the",
          "I was visiting Edmonton in early March and, at my urging, convinced friends to check out the AGA! While the building itself is a stunning piece of architecture, the exhibits were very sparse and amateurish and i felt embarrassed that i had recommended it to my friends. I",
          "We happened to come on their monthly kid's Sunday. In addition to the kid's area (which was so much fun and interactive for all of us), they had several tables set up with additional crafts and creative things to do. These were all related to the adult exhibition on bush-craft.",
          "We visited the AGA on a thursday evening when it was free (after 5) and I have to say I was really disapponted. The exhibits where sparse and we were able to complete the entire thing in 30 min. There was just not enough inspiring art to justify the drive and parking. Staff at",
          "Art Gallery of Alberta currently offers Free Community Night Visit on Thursday evenings from 5 to 8 pm. Definitely a great opportunity to visit this 3 storey gallery at no charge. The gallery has a beautiful exterior design and has interestting interior display worth a visit.",
          "We made our first visit to the art gallery this summer and were really disappointed with the exhibits. This is pretty subjective though as I am more interested in classical art than modern art, which dominated the gallery at the time. Exhibits aside, the building itself is",
          "Great place for gatherings, viewing art of every era, and pursuing the architecture inside and outside of this amazing structure. Great spot for a date night.",
          "I frequent the AGA when I come to Edmonton. Often they curate amazing shows. They showcase Canadian art and they have trained people to help shed light on the images you are seeing. Not only is the building beautiful the galleries each have their own unique atmosphere. The",
          "I am a member and attend the opening Art For Lunch talks once a month as well as view the collections The gallery staff organize installations and collections embracing different themes and artists often local AB artists are featured as well as from across Canada and abroad .",
          "Interesting photography exhibit. I would have liked to have seen more paintings but the second floor was closed. Would I go back? Yes.",
          "Love the architecture of the building, the pieces on display were the landscapes of Canada, pretty good in my opinion, and great place to take pictures, the stairs and construction is simply great",
          "We loved the outside of the building, but the art that was on display was not what we thought it would be and it was a lot smaller.",
          "I was photographing an event at the Art Gallery and was blown away by this beautiful building and the exhibits. We had a chance to have a private viewing of all the galleries and it was absolutely amazing!!",
          "First off - the AGA staff were extremely kind and helpful. I was made to feel very welcome as an out of towner. The \"Celebration of Canadian Landscape\" show was just marvelous - beautifully curated and such an engaging diversity of pieces I could have spent my entire time in",
          "Went to take in the \"Celebration of the Canadian Landscape\" which I enjoyed and appreciated for the most part but the whole experience in this new Gallery was disappointing. From the grungy front steps, through uninspiring fairly empty rooms, up the stairs to what should have",
          "This is very much worth a visit. The Art Gallery of Alberta is one of the new attractions in Edmonton. It is an exciting piece of architecture and houses a range of changing exhibitions. Overall, it is not huge, so an hour or two may be enough for a visit. But it is a very",
          "It was just one of those days when I decided to stroll around the city and this was one of my stops. Everything looks really nice. Friendly staff and they really know a lot about art. Will definitely come back when there's another artist on show.",
          "The gallery is relatively small but it is always exciting to visit when new exhibits come to town. The facade is a beautiful work of art worth seeing if nothing else.",
          "Very interesting architecture that is worth checking out in its own right. Lobby has some amazing sculptures, even if you dont want to pay or take the time to go in, its at least worth taking a peak at the building.",
          "A different approach to a wedding venue- this couple made an art if it. Seating was tight & as the main floor was rectangular you really couldn't see anyone except for those tables around you. Food was good. Service was good ambience was good. Art was interesting.",
          "When it first opened a few years ago, I was a bit disappointed in the range and types of art. There's more happening there now, so it is worth the visit. The pre-Raphaelite drawings, pretty much all from the Saskatoon-based Lansdowne collection, were well presented and the",
          "AGA presents 8 exhibitions this summer. In the lobby, there is a mural - The Flood - by Edmonton artist Sean Caulfield till August 4. Also great exhibit of 7 native Indians (80 paintings from Norval Morrisseau, Daphne Odjig, Alex Janvier etc) - till July 3rd.",
          "The design is so cool. You have great expectation of the content. But there is nothing. Construction, unfriendly reception, you still have to pay for the visit. All in All ,not worth to visit.",
          "This is a small museum of contemporary Canadian Artist which you can easily visit in two hours. The building's architecture is outstanding. The collection is less so, but they are doing a good job of providing Canadian content. There was a Pre-Raphaelite drawing special",
          "This building is really cool and it's a neat space. It's about $13 to enter, which is a bit pricy. The gallery isn't too big, and it won't take you a long time to get through it. I have seen some really great exhibits here including Degas, the Indian Group of Seven,",
          "There are 3 floors of galleries to explore. Several invite you to respond and provide space and materials i.e. to add to a weaving or make a sketch. There is a \"touching\" room where you can colour, add rubbings or use tangrams. We adults happily indulged. The exhibits were",
          "We loved this wacky building and enjoyed the Picasso exhibition on the ground level. It doesn't have a huge number of paintings but there are four levels and temporary shows. Good small cafe at the top level with stunning view of the architecture. We also were guests at a",
          "The Art Gallery of Alberta is housed in one of the city's most interesting and iconic buildings, with a fa\u00e7ade of flowing steel and angular glass faces. While the gallery occasionally hosts travelling exhibitions of master works, much of the collection focuses on lesser known",
          "Unfortunately only two galleries were open on the day I was there. There were two well curated presentations- one of two local artists (which was very interesting) and a well presented historical sketches. There was lots of activities for young children available with folks to",
          "Small but beautiful museum. Often special activities for children. Amazing architecture. Changing exhibits.",
          "The building is interesting both from he outside and what's inside. I didn't enjoy any of the exhibits of contemporary art, which is all they had",
          "The weather was threatening and for us cool (early Sept) so we went in - who wouldn't be attracted to the neat almost Guggenheim style roof lines. The museum is modest .. the exhibit on when we were there was Pre-Raphaelite and excellent. The modern wing was excellent ( top",
          "There weren't a lot of exhibitions on when I visited the museum. The exterior of the building would suggest that there is much to inspire awe awaiting inside, however I was disappointed. The few exhibits that were open were okay. It would be nice to see more Alberta artists",
          "Sorry. I just went to National Gallery of Ireland. So comparing to it would be bad. However, it is so sad to see how poor our Art Gallery is. The permanent exhibition is not worth to see. Of course, there are several Group of Seven arts. Unfortunately, there is not much to see",
          "The glitzy new Art Gallery of Alberta replaced a perfectly serviceable classic modernist concrete building that for decades housed the less ambitiously named \"Edmonton Art Gallery\". The new building certainly makes more of a visual statement that its predecessor, announcing",
          "But basically an art gallery once you are inside, some traveling exhibits to make it more interesting for frequent visitors. Very good shop",
          "Art was limited and extremely average some of it bordering on totally laughable. The Indigonous Art was nice. The restaurant wasn't open as well as a few rooms were empty.",
          "Visited a few weeks ago. We have visited other art galleries this year but this art gallery was dismal. Only one exhibit was good - the authentication of a picture. The mollusks humdifying was bizarre. The attempt at an indigenous exhibit with stacked sifters or the lecturns",
          "Highly over priced for kids . And not enough staff to help explain exhibits Not enough For young kids to see and do . Front desk not friendly at all",
          "The AGA is spectacularly housed in a very interesting building from the outside. Inside, I find the gallery space smaller and somewhat less imaginative than expected. On my first visit I was quite disappointed with the exhibitions but this time around I was very pleased. The",
          "the building promises much but once you paid the 13dollar entry there is not much spectacular things inside. the rooms all look alike, simple squares and not a single hibt of architecture left for where the expo is going on. the paintings are middleclass, nothing extraordinary",
          "iif you're interested in art you must go here. The building itself is amazing, especially lit at night. There are 5 galleries showing a variety of work, some traditional, some more conceptual and challenging. Great children's gallery and gift shop.",
          "The AGA is a noncommercial mind bending experience of our humanity in relation...(to what is part of the discovery that the artists offer). Who needs travel when art can transport you and at the same time make you feel you have come home.",
          "I am not sure what to write in here but you will enjoy your visit here. You can find many beautiful arts as you would have expected. Good to visit with friends and family",
          "Closed on Mondays even though there was an open-air arts festival going on. The exterior, the bold modern architecture, fitting for an arts museum just rose our desire to return the next day (July 5). We did and even got a 25% discount on admission. First we visited a well done",
          "Many great exhibits to visit. Amazing food in the resturant. A beautiful view of the Churchill square and City Hall in Edmonton, AB",
          "Visited this Art Gallery as a late relative was a Member her and he & his friends loved coming here. \"The Unvarnished Truth\" Exhibition is absolutely fascinating and reveals so much about the techniques, materials and \"ticks\" that so many famous artists used. For the technically",
          "During my stay in Edmonton I took my daughters (age 3 & 5) to the AGA. We were pleasantly surprised that they had a little exhibit for children which was very hands on. It involved 3D images, moving objects as well as puzzles that really engaged the kids. It was not very large",
          "The native art concentrates on ~3 artists. We loved their works and the exhibits which are on the 2nd floor of the museum. The 3rd floor has fossils that are not labeled at all, few in number, dispersed among clear plastic forms to hold them that stick out from the sides and",
          "I was here for a conference meeting and really enjoyed the overall place. The architecture and pieces were all good, and the gift shop also had good items. It's a great place for visitors!",
          "I recently took friends from NZ who really enjoyed the architecture but there needs to be more art. Also the kids room was very small and not that interactive.",
          "spent the day with some seniors looking at the galleries.the cafe was good also and the gift shop lots of nice things at good price",
          "I was here for a conference and really enjoyed it. Lots of room for meetings and a beautiful setting in the middle of the city. A great venue for hosting any type of event. And lots of great art too!",
          "Been once so far, it was pretty interesting. It has all the things you would expect an art gallery to have including a coffee bar; there was a really neat statue of a dinosaur made from blue bins that I found quite appealing, best to see for yourself.",
          "an interesting exhibition, one gallery that featured old masters and showed how they had been created/restored. also a very extensive collection of Native art and stories about their background. Third floor in between displays so admission price was adjusted accordingly, a nice",
          "Loved the Group of 7 exhibit. Canadian art at its finest. The building is architecturally cool and the roof top cafe patio is a gem in the heart of the city. BIG thank you to the gallery for welcoming Fort McMurray evacuees for free during this time of transition. An afternoon",
          "We always enjoy coming and thats why we are season ticket holders we get to see some of the great traveling art displays",
          "So, I love this place. The architecture of this building is breathtaking. I love going in there and just taking a million pictures! When we went in March 2016 we saw some Thom Thompson ( from theCanadian Group of Seven), Proffessional Native Indian Artist exhibit and a cool",
          "The art gallery of Alberta provide a nice environment for visitors, but the displays were not very interesting....",
          "Although not a large gallery compared to some, nonetheless, it is a fascinating display of art and architecture. The Group of Seven is very important to us, and their take on this well-studied group was new and different. We took the free (with admission) 20 minute tour was",
          "It is a pretty small gallery in a well-designed building. They do have very nice temporary exhibitions every once in a while, but sometimes visitors have not much to see. It pays to monitor their event calendar.",
          "Very artsy venue--literally. The history and design of this new piece of architecture is cool. Art collections: hit and miss when it comes to how impressive the exhibits are, but isn't that what art's all about? FREE ADMISSION every last Thursday of the month, in the EVENING.",
          "Visiting the Art Gallery always pushes me to consider different forms of art. I always enjoy the group of seven displays but find it difficult to appreciate some of the other galleries.",
          "So if you are not a fan of art or just a tourist that is not sure where to visit, DON'T. It is a very cultured place full of cultured stuffs for cultured people. My brain hurt trying to understand whats what",
          "We visited the AGA to see the Group of Seven paintings. Very interesting and informative. We also thoroughly enjoyed the Blur in Between that was also showing at the AGA. We do not go often, three or four times per year, but we highly recommend you visit. The last Thursday of",
          "There was an interactive exhibit about textiles happening, and you could learn how to do rug hooking. the exhibit on the top floor was being swapped out, so there was a discount on admission. Really neat place to spend a couple hours.",
          "One show of Tom Thompson and the Group of Seven being I talked at the time so one space not available. Other exhibits were very well chosen and the docent was excellent and very available. The space also provided active participation with it's community members. AND the building",
          "For a big city, the art here was pretty disappointing- a lot of abstract and avant garde. But it brings in some good special exhibits but they are small. It has a free night last Thursday of the month. Better off just to walk down 124th street and jasper Ave and look through the",
          "A great building, a pleasant cafe space on the top floor and some decent Albertan art especially the landscape paintings on the first floor. Also a 'live' artist studio. Certainly worth a visit in a downtown without a vast array of cultural attractions!",
          "Not only is the EdmontonArt Gallery beautiful inside it is also on the outside. though I wish there was a lot more land around it. the exhibitions are always changing. there is a great restaurant. gourmet style. but be ready to pay for the experience. there is a lovely terrace",
          "I enjoy paintings, and I'm open to different types and interpretations of art, but I'm just not into the types of displays the gallery had on this summer. I live in Edmonton, and have never been to the Art Gallery before, so was looking forward to a new experience in my own",
          "Depending on the featured artist this can be more or less interesting, and it obviously depends on your taste in art. The permanent collection is not that impressive.",
          "Perhaps the best thing about AGA is the building itself, it is very progressive and modern, a true gem compared to the usual mutilated architectural urbanism the city is so proud of. Unfortunately the gallery lacks essence, substance and direction. Perhaps the worse thing about",
          "Unfortunately the museum has little to offer in respect to unusual or vastly interesting exhibits. I return each month (recently every two or three months) only in the hope that the space will be used well and I will leave with a renewed faith that the building that cost",
          "I don't know what it says about the AGA that the highlight of the trip for my wife and I was the architecture of the building itself. I'll put it down to both of us being engineers who also enjoy art. Being massive fans of the AGO and ROM in Toronto (and of modernist",
          "During our visit there was showing of Italian baroque as well as other artists. The room most fascinating to me was where drawings revealed different perceptions using 3d effects. Another room had works by Chris Cran some of which required the use of a camera. There is a bar/",
          "The Art Gallery of Alberta is conveniently located in the heart of Edmonton. Its very unique shape and form can only beckon out to you and persuade you to came and see. The art work contained inside covers many types and historical interests, contemporary paintings, sculptures,",
          "A great way to spend a rainy day. The exhibits are current and interesting. I highly recommend signing up for a tour to delve even further into the meaning behind the artworks! The building itself is a marvel to behold.",
          "So I was here when they had Italian Baroque collection and it did win the day over the other galleries... Nice to come out to enjoy, nice roof patio to enjoy on good day with cup of what you like..",
          "very nice lay out of building outside, but not as enticing inside. Hope they'll add more things to see inside.",
          "Purchased an annual pass but wasn't the experience I'd hoped for. The exhibits were ok, their events over priced, the restaurant attached although it gets fav reviews is overpriced & loud.",
          "If you like post modern art then you may enjoy this art gallery. For the most part I found the art unimpressive and uninspiring. The best part of the art gallery is the building itself and the gift shop. I would say this is the best gift shop in Edmonton and has unique gifts. I",
          "Very nice layout, great way to spend an afternoon. Great variety of artists and backgrounds. Building in itself very interesting.",
          "I gave the art gallery 5 stars in part because the architecture is so amazing. It is a small art gallery, but worth taking a bit of time to go though the exhibits they have. We took part in a couple tours that are led by volunteers and they were excellent. Also, there is a",
          "A wonderful change of local and international artists, amazing to see home grown talent here in Edmonton. Nice for a Sunday afternoon.",
          "It's a beautiful building on the outside but the entrance leads you into a vast, dismal, usually empty room, sort of like a railway station without the passengers. The person who takes your money is friendly enough, as are the staff in the gift shop--about the only time I get",
          "A spectacular building in the heart of the city, giving us all the opportunity to sample artists from around the world! Admission is affordable and there is always something new to see. I have seen exhibits that range from Emily Carr to Andy Warhol. An Edmonton treasure for",
          "If you have $13.13 and an hour and thirty minutes to spare this is your place. But you need to be an art enthusiasts to really appreciate this place. Very accommodating staffs and their AC works well.",
          "While staying at the Fairmont Macdonald hotel, we visited the Art Gallery of Alberta. We enjoyed most of the exhibits and spent a couple of hours walking around the various halls. Good value for your dollar, and the on-site store is a nice place to shop for unique gifts",
          "the AGA has a modern look both inside and out, housing some of canada's most important pieces as well as exhibitions from around the world, spend some time there, you'll be glad you did.",
          "My brother and I spent the afternoon at the Art Gallery of Alberta and had a nice afternoon, however it was a little underwhelming. The gallery is extremely clean, well maintained, and has very interesting architecture. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The",
          "It is a great feeling to see a world class gallery in the city center. With a magnificent design and stunning art on display you can wonder around for hours taking it all in.",
          "Depending on what's on display at the time, this can be a very quiet relaxing experience, or a very crowded one. I prefer to wait for a quiet time, its nice to be able to enjoy the studios and read any info on the artists. If its a possibility, you must try the restaurant. We",
          "What a masterpiece in architecture alone, It is even more impressive in person that pictures show. The gallery is not very big though with limited number of pieces at any time. What is great is how often exhibitions are replaced with new exhibitions. I would have liked more",
          "Impressive building in a good central city location. Entry was a bit pricey at about $12 each adult but quite we enjoyed the art we saw and the nice view from the roof top terrace. Our 11 year old daughter enjoyed the children's section based on the children's book, 'Who is",
          "Went to a great group party here. 3 levels and a patio with bars on top and entrance levels. Food by Zinc was excellent!",
          "have had birthday parties, been to galas, art auctions at the AGA. what a wonderful place to be at in the heart of downtown... and the food each and every time has been spectacular. take it in!",
          "Absolutely amazing building, this one really makes Edmonton proud. Go for the architecture, but enjoy the artwork within as well.",
          "Essentially no permanent collection to speak of so important to check the current exhibits before going. Recent visit worth a couple of hours as the two primary exhibits were worth the time.",
          "Wow. This visiting exhibit alone was worth the price of admission. A compilation of the surreal and scary in an amazing series of pieces. Do not miss seeing DaveandJenn, No End.",
          "The art gallery itself is a work of art. The galleries are small but definitely worth the visit with displays rotating over time. While there, stop in at Zinc, the gallery's restaurant, for dinner.",
          "this is a place where the young generation of Edmonton can get inspired towards art and culture. they have different exhibitions all the time and its always busy. everyone should try this place at least once, even if you don't like art",
          "Based on this single visit, it does not appear the AGA has a permanent collection upon which it can hang its hat, which means your visit is going to depend upon how the current exhibits match up with your taste. The first of which, immediately after the entrance, involving some",
          "We went to Art Gallery of Alberta the other day. Didn't know what to expect, nor we knew what exhibitions are going on currently. Exceptional and modern building from inside and outside, beautiful if you like photographing. Not huge fan of contemporary art but it was great",
          "They do a great job of cycling through unique exhibitions. Always something interesting from local artists. The place always leaves you wanting a little more though, and I make it a point to check it out every time I go to Edmonton. They don't just do the vanilla exhibitions",
          "I cannot believe they charge to see this place. Compared to other art galleries in the world, this place is embarrassing. Grandiose look on the outside but tiny inside with not much to see.",
          "I've visited the AGA few times hoping that it would get better but have been disappointed every time. I decided to stop going unless they have a free admission night (which there is on the last Thursday of every month 6 to 9pm) and I really don't have anything more interesting",
          "The variance in displays from one season to the next is appreciated. I love the unique experiences I've had there. It would get 5 stars if I hadn't experienced art museums in Ireland and England. But for edmonton I'm very impressed.",
          "I went on March 4. The 2nd floor was being set up so only the 1st and 3rd floor were available. The \"Art\" felt very amateur, that took little to no talent. Just throw a couple things together, write a summary on how it effects emotions and a state of mind.... And that's Art. The",
          "Go just to see the building! The paintings are great too.This is part of the downtowns new architectural centre.",
          "The AGA is a small gallery (by world standards) with excellent display space. Something for everyone. Access is easy via nearby on street parking, underground at City Hall or via downtown indoor pedway.",
          "Though I am sure it will often be better the exhibition of local modern artists during our visit had little to commend itself. All 4 adults visiting were far from impressed. However clearly a venue with promise.",
          "Very interesting building and interesting interior. Nice gift shop and decent little coffee stand on the top floor. Exhibits are well laid out, but due to the size of the gallery, I'd want to make sure that all gallery halls are showing. If one is being set-up when you go, it",
          "Galleries need higher quality to maintain and attract a healthy attendance. Many local artists as well as travelling shows could show off this gallery",
          "I make it to the AGA at least once a year and it is always worth a visit. The building itself is a work of art and interesting to explore. The exhibits are always changing so check the website to see what is on. Right now there is a cool photography exhibit and some",
          "The building itself is neat. The \"artwork\" was beyond lame. There wasn't a lot to look at and what there was was very average unattractive photographs. I had a free pass and it still wasnt worth it.",
          "The awesomeness of your trip definitely depends on the exhibitions. While I am not a big fan of painted artwork, I love industrial and urban photography, so it was definitely the right time for me to go when works by Edward Burtynsky and Colin Smith were on display. I really",
          "You wont forget your first visit to AGA! The shiny Zinc curved exterior and swooping interior is world-class architecture! It's everything an art gallery should be, and more. ( the more means catering and banquet facilities, art education opportunities and fine dining onsite.",
          "We had the opportunity to visit the Art Gallery for the first time on Canada Day, where they were allowing everyone to enter for free for the day. Even with the long line ups, the exhibits were well worth the wait!",
          "This is definitely a good art gallery for a city the size of Edmonton, but it wasn't very busy on the night I visited and I can understand why. The gallery isn't geared towards tourists or people who are new to art. Many of the information signs next to the pieces don't say",
          "Top notch exhibits, great features and a unique looking structure; which constitutes as an art display unto itself. You cannot compare this gallery to the Gugenheim or other world renowned galleries, but it is a feature in downtown that gives Edmonton that extra level. With the",
          "Don't imagine this is a museum like one in a major city; on the other hand, it is an excellent museum for a city of one million people. The building itself is beautiful I saw an excellent show there last week by 5 Israeli artists. It was deeply compelling and superbly executed",
          "My wife and I visited the gallery today, the exhibits are always changing so instead of describing the exhibit I'm going to focus on the general visit: It is kind of expensive comparing this gallery with other museums or attractions, I mean, the beaux arts in montreal is cheaper",
          "Me and my fiance were up for a family wedding. It was a good time. The gallery was a neat place. From the theatre ceremony to the cocktail reception upstairs. and the dinner next to the big wall painting. tho the service wasnt great.",
          "The only good thing about the gallery is the building design and the cheap admission fees ... most of the 'art' is regular everyday photographs taken in the mountains.",
          "This unique infrastructure is the only one of its kind. Its roof is like a lady's hair on its fullest. :) The reception area itself is a silent advertisement of the gallery. I enjoyed taking pictures and lots of family pictures on its artful wall. entrance fees are collected to",
          "For anyone visiting Edmonton, don't pass up the Art Gallery of Alberta, which offers world-class art in a beautiful setting. The building itself is a work of art - modern, with beautiful lines and curves and a soaring light-filled interior - and their rotating exhibitions",
          "This amazingly modern building caught my eye from a distance, so I decided to check it out. While the building itself is a work of art, there's a lot to check out inside as well. Unfortunately. It was closed for a wedding during my visit...but what we were able to see certainly",
          "If you make just one stop in Alberta, make it this. The building's design mirrors the city's topography: the straight lines of its very square grid with the snaky river meandering through it. Stunning from the outside, it merits a visit inside as well: the gallery's outstanding",
          "The museum doesn't have its own permanent collection, but rather lends art from a variety of sources. Some of the exhibitions come from the National Art Gallery of Canada. On the one hand, this is great as the museum is constantly evolving. On the other hand, you never know what",
          "Perhaps it was the two special exhibitions going on, but the AGA proved to be my second favorite attraction of our recent visit to Edmonton, Alberta--Elk Island being the first. The architectural design of the building is in itself worth a visit... In observance of the 100 year",
          "I love that we could really take our time enjoying the Chagall exhibition. Without the normal magnitude of art clambering for your attention one can settle into this body of work and enjoy it thoroughly. Well spent time and good coffee to finish a pleasant day.",
          "The art gallery is in need of some spice. The current displays are mediocre at best. On the top floor, interesting that a lady spent all those years collecting seaside objects, but not so much from an art perspective as a human psychological perspective. Would like to see",
          "I guess they had nothing left over for the contents after spending everything on the structure. I went once when one of the main features was a room made to look like a farmhouse in Saskatchewan in a rainstorm. I guess that is art and I admit that I remember it, It did seem",
          "I have been to the gallery twice and both times I have been disappointed. I find the exhibits to be a bit on the boring side. I also find there isn't enough in the gallery and that visits are generally rather short. The building itself is rather amazing and incredibly beautiful.",
          "This museum is a first rate place, however the gallery space is a little on the limited side. It's a nice spot to kill 2 hours or so, but compared to larger galleries you will not be overly overwhelmed. The architecture of the museum is quite impressive and they seem to have a",
          "I went with a group from U of A. The tour the staff gave us was boring, boring, I mean... really boring. The guy though it was more important to show us their new conference room with I do not know how many seats than spend time at the gallery itself. As for the time we spent in",
          "Worth seeing but not exactly world class exhibitions - in fact the top floor displays were rather odd and unusual to say the least - not something I would go out of my way to see.",
          "A beautiful building and space. Exquisite exhibition. Great deli sandwiches and good coffee. What more can anybody desire on a very cold winters afternoon on the Prairie? The Chagall exhibition is a must-experience for young and old. What a way to \"see\" another one of the",
          "Visited the Art Gallery of Alberta on a Wednesday evening, where they have late opening and a free cocktail as part of the admission price - nice. Not the normal amount on display as they were preparing for a new exhibition in December, but the price was reduced accordingly, so",
          "There was a guide everywhere and I could see a lot of beautiful art work... Most of them very old stuff... It was amazing, I really liked! If you are in Edmonton travelling, you have to go!",
          "Incredible building. Perfect day, clear and cold with sun coming through the angled windows in the heart of the city. A great place to hang out and take in the exhibits. Really enjoyed the small exhibit on the Far North Weather Station - would be interesting to see similar",
          "A colleague and I were in Edmonton and took the very convenient Light Rail Transit from the University of Alberta to the Gallery (there is a station right below the gallery), and happened to be there on Alberta Cultural Days so it was no-cost to enter. I enjoyed the exhibits,",
          "The AGA is a great art gallery with excellent new exhibitions on a regular basis. I love the permanent, historical artwork maybe more than the new, contemporary shows.The restaurant is chic and inviting.",
          "Stunning new building but quite small. There were several interesting and varied exhibitions. Convenient location beside City Hall",
          "the art gallery is housed in a wonderful building, however be warned that the collection on display within it is quite small. against the admission price this makes the gallery relatively expensive versus museums in other major cities.",
          "We recently held our wedding reception at the Art Gallery of Alberta. The venue has a good design to set up tables with great lighting coming in from the multiple stories of windows. The building had an unmatched design which compliments professional picture taking. We used the",
          "Lovely architecture but no permanent art collection to be seen and 2 of the galleries were closed so somewhat disappointing. The City Hall had more art displayed!",
          "Easy to visit and in the heart of the city. Beware closed some days. The building alone is worth the effort and is architecturally. quite fascinating. .",
          "A lovely place to think! Very spacious and quiet, with many security guards, and staff on hand to answer your questions. There were no less than three exhibits there when I visited (in June), and they were all fascinating. I was lucky to see some Group of Seven paintings, and",
          "Wonderful couple of hours. The exhibits and the building itself were fantastic. My first art gallery experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "It's nice to have an upgraded space for visual art in Edmonton... Particularly appreciate the student membership (very affordable) that gets you into openings, etc... Great to get more touring exhibitions as well...",
          "Awesome structure both inside and out and the exhibits were thought provoking and beautifully presented. I wish more buildings were this creatively and functionally designed. It would make cities a lot more interesting to visit. Congratulations, Edmonton.",
          "We went to see the dutch landscape artists! There was lots to see and there was even a Van Gough on display. The tour was nice and our tour guide was very friendly and helpful. Afterwards we went to the gift shop which always has really cool stuff.",
          "Of course, art is too personal to decide for others; however, both of our trips to this interesting building have been worth it for everyone in the family. On our last visit, we tried a docent's tour of the Dutch Landscape exhibit and I found the tour could have been quite a",
          "Upon arriving I asked the very nice lady at the guest desk if I would be able to take photos with my Nikon D60 camera, and she said that I absolutely could so long as I didn't have the flash on. Totally understandable! I have been to many art galleries and am always advised of",
          "It was so boring! The art was interesting, but most of them looked the same! Same colors, same style, same depressing trip. And way to over-priced!",
          "Have travelled extensively and find this to be one of the best small galleries with a regional mandate. The exhibits from the Gallery's permanent collection feature local artists as befits the mandate of a regional gallery and there are supplanted by exhibits of borrowed or",
          "I've been to the gallery three or four times now, and every time I'm disappointed. There have been a few very good exhibits, but they tend to be quite small, and I don't feel like the admission price is worth the experience. This is coming from an art and gallery lover!",
          "If you are interested in art, run, do not walk, to the AGA. The building is to die for. The quality of the exhibits is excellent. The gift store has all sorts of treasures I have not seen elsewhere. If you are hungry, nosh at Zinc restaurant which is right in the building, but",
          "Very little to see when I was there, art work that was there was so far out I did not consider it art. A real waste of the taxpayers dollar on this one. Do not waste you money.",
          "There wasn't a lot to see when we went to the gallery because much of it was closed while new displays were being set up. Anyone who is interested in etchings and Japanese items would have had plenty to examine, but there were none of the oil paintings and sculptures that would",
          "another of the mayor's give the money to USA architect instead of Canadian architect will continue to come back to hit him in the face. that structure would do well in Los Angeles, but not in Edmonton where there is snow and ice. Of course, one million dollars for the",
          "This building is stunning inside & out. While I found the permanent collection to be a bit of a letdown, the AGA has brought in some fantastic exhibits including Picasso's drawings, Degas, Escher and even a Warner Brother's Cartoon exhibit for the kids. Step out onto the 2nd",
          "The outside of the building looks amazing, and makes you think there will be more to look at once you get inside. It was a let down.",
          "Beautiful building, great artwork, big open spaces, an interactive room for kids (big and small) to bring the visit to life and the exhibit 'Wild Beasts' is worth a visit alone. A superb collection of intricate etchings of the fantastic.",
          "Personal home town feel with continuously changing exhibits, so you don't get bored. Come enjoy and see for yourself...",
          "it's an interesting building and the art is great. it's small, but it's not too bad. I enjoy the architecture of the building",
          "I personally enjoyed viewing this art gallery. However to give an objective review I would say that if you are the type of person who doesn't understand art or is perplexed as to how a black or white painting gets in an art gallery or if you only enjoy the masters then you may",
          "An Edmonton must see! Wonderful exhibits, I really enjoyed my visit this summer. Alberta has a large and wonderful arts community. Love the new gallery!",
          "This is a must see for yourself. Even if it is just for the building in it self. The Art is also fabulous.",
          "Sad about the money spent to create a poor gallery with limited wall space and even more limited talent it is nothing special dont waste your time unless there is a special showing or you admire interesting architecture",
          "Brought my kids. Had an enjoyable time. Great place for taking pictures. It felt like a place of solitude.",
          "Opened in 2010, the building is impressive! It is quite small compared to galleries in Toronto and Montreal, but it is certainly worth visiting. I was hoping to see Albertan art rather than works from eastern Canada. (I liked the Automatiste show since I missed it in Ontario",
          "The monies spent was for an unusual exterior and the interior was lacking of character and forward thinking. The rooms to view paints are small and one cannot appreciate the beauty of the displays",
          "The building's unique architecture makes a great improvement to Edmonton's downtown appearance, exhibits are interesting and varied. Check out the Zinc restaurant in the gallery",
          "A great place to hold a wedding. They did an incredible job, decorating and dealing with over 200 people at the wedding we attended this past weekend. It really is a beautiful building.",
          "I'm so proud of this building. The architecture is beautiful and brave. The exhibits are usually quite good. The inside of the gallery is chic and well taken care of. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. Admission is free last Thursday of each month between 6-9 pm.",
          "This is a beautiful building to look at and World Class art exhibits. Andy Warhold exhibit was great. It looks to me to be a couple of ballet slippers but I understand the buiilding is actually supposed to represent the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights.",
          "And a couple of great exhibitions too! I remember the old AGA from my last trip here six or seven years ago. This is miles beyond.",
          "Beautiful jewel of a museum. Lovely building, well-curated, fascinating exhibits. Great terrace cafe, too. And they offer a free cocktail on Tuesday evenings in summer with museum admission.",
          "Beautiful displays. Take a guided tour if you can as it gives so much more insight. Quiet. Birthday parties on lower level looked fun!",
          "I just wasn't impressed with the material displayed. Some of it too far out for me and really thought a lot of wasted space. And it was incredible small I thought.",
          "the architecture is neat. Didn't get time to look around inside much. We were only in the auditorium for the wedding ceremony.",
          "A great location, some interesting exhibits, explored in great depth. The only negative is in my opinion there is the focus is too much on \"modern\" art (i.e. less than 80 years old) vs classic.",
          "I love going here. Art is such an important part of our culture and what a beautiful place to display it",
          "The building in itself is a work of art, and is a major feature of Edmonton's growing Arts District.",
          "I was looking forward to cing here for an afternoon's culture but actually was largely disappointed. The space-age exterior promises more than it ultimately delivers. Some interesting artwork but was expecting more...also have been told that there seems to be some perpetual",
          "The building itself is a work of art. Take some time to explore the building from each level. It offers some interesting views of Churchill Square and downtown. The programming in each gallery changes fairly often and of course depends on your personal taste. There are currently",
          "Interesting building to see. Limited collection on view but well displayed. Admission charge applies and you also have to pay $1 to access a locker to leave bags, etc. which are not allowed in the gallery.",
          "The shows are hit and miss but the building is really spectacular (from the inside and the outside). There is a really nice theatre space in the basement where I've seen some interesting modern dance. They have a diverse program with something on offer for everyone.",
          "This new facility is built on land that was going to be a women's shelter. Winspear bought them out. I don't know what was wrong with the old art gallery. I have fond memories of making an ashtray in art class there when I was little. This building is modern and spacious and",
          "We enjoyed the focus on Alberta artists. The building itself is a work of art. Art is tastefully displayed and small crowds make thoughtful observation accessible to all. There is a childrens' room with tiles that make noise--our children were surprised and amazed at this.",
          "Thoughtfully prepared exhibits emphasizing local artists as well as historical/international artists.",
          "I often visit art galleries when I visit cities and this was no exception. It had some wonderful art and some peculiar art. It is an amazing building, but a reasonably small collection.",
          "good place to see the art. I went over there with my family. Will sure visit again.",
          "Amazing building, great place to visit! Definitely one of Edmonton's must sea's. Soon (and hopefully) will become part of a great series of destination attractions in Downtown Edmonton.",
          "One should visit the art gallery. Interesting art.",
          "nice place to visit. one should sure visit the art gallery",
          "Having visited many of the worlds best Art galleries I would have to say it is a good thing this one has and interesting building although lacking in wall space. The choices of artists and art work I have seen in the 5 or 6 visits i have made to the Edmonton Art Galley almost",
          "We hosted our 2011 Christmas Open House at the Art Gallery. The food, service and atmosphere was fantastic!",
          "I love the inside of this building - it is a design delight and makes me proud of our city. The displays are always changing so it makes for a fun trip everytime I go. I went to a private evening function awhile ago and it was magical at night....",
          "If you're looking for a gift or a souvenir for a guest to edmonton, the AGA gift shop is always full of nice gifts. I love going in to browse what they've recently brought in.",
          "My wife and I visited AGA on Family Day in February with free admission and swa soem lovely exhibits. AGA is a very good addition to Edmonton Arts District with the Winspear concert hall beside it, and a brand new Royal Alberta Museum to be built nearby soon.",
          "Very unique look! and great addition to the City of Edmonton!",

          "This place is wonderful for people to have in Edmonton. So nicley set up and a great place to learn. Art Work and themes change there from month to month so you can go back over and over. Its great for the family as well.",
          "Delightful interplay between industrial materials and super-subtle skewing of its angles marks this as Edmonton's premier aesthetic adventure, the biggest surprise and oasis in an otherwise over-square, too-shiny city centre. Before entering and afterward, look up before you",

          "Food, service Ambience - all was great! strongly recommended!!",

          "Excellent exhibitions, plenty of information on art work, easy to navigate.",

          "If you like art galleries you will love visiting this one. The building internally and externally are worth the visit. BTW the last Thursday of every month is free admission after 6pm. Also Zinc restaurant is attached and is a fantastic fancy dining experiance.",
          "The renos were much hyped but left me a bit cold, especially in cold weather. All the glass and steel was chilly. An odd odor in many of the rooms. However, the art work was fantastic as always, including some installation pieces from Canada's north. Staff friendly and eager to",
          "As an artist I find the AGA to have a perfect venue for enjoying the outstanding collection and travelling exhibits. The space falls away and you are left to enjoy the art. I'll be back for sure",

          "Very nice & interesting. We were here about a year ago and I forgot to do the review. I loved the exhibit of the different houses in Edmonton. Although I've always noticed the different architecture on doorways of homes in the older parts \u2026",
          "The Art Gallery of Alberta is a great place to visit and see many different mediums of various artists on display. Not to mention the fact that the structure itself is artistic in its design. Has a good assortment of displays that I am sure \u2026",
          "Best time to go is Thursday evening as the art gallery is free. Be sure to make a reservation for Zinc, just after the gallery closes and enjoy a nice meal and a bottle of wine. Parking can be tricky as it is down town, but if you listen to my advice, parking will be free at 6 and you will not have to worry.",

Installation was laid out very functionally,  good flow,  each part felt isolated in terms of story yet contributed to an over all impression of the creators narrative. \nA couple of displays were a bit jarring in terms of noise compared to the overall silence. Technology is not always quiet.",

          "One of the best art galleries in Canada gets a 4.3 rating?! The architecture of the building alone is a wonder of human achievement. A must visit for anyone traveling to the city and a gift to locals. ps. Coffee at the top floor is my favorite, warm and cozy nest of pleasure.",

          "I love the art gallery and I try to attend each time they attain a new exhibit. I bring my children as they are well behaved and enjoy it. I also appreciate that children are free. Great value. Probably most culture I've experienced in all of Edmonton. The parking is a hectic and pricey mess though.",

          "The Zinc restaurant was wonderful.",
          "The museum is small enough to allow you to see the whole thing without suffering from overload. The focus is largely on modern art, and a lot of the pieces were challenging, which I liked. I'm glad they aren't shying away from cutting edge \u2026",
          "One level was closed but we got a discounted price on entry, really varied and interesting exhibitions.",
          "Beautiful building with a wide variety of exhibitions",
          "I have been to AGA many times now and the art is always interesting. It's quiet, not alot of people and the front desk is super nice. The only downside is that sometimes there's only one or two things to look at and then it's pretty much the end of what there is to see. It would be nice if there was more art!!!!",
          "Always great! Loving the adult drop-in class offerings.",
          "Edmonton has a beautiful art gallery from the outside and various different artists are always changing on the inside it's free every Tuesday and Thursday evening I believe.  It really depends on what kind of art you like they had a photo \u2026",
          "This gallery has great installations all the time! I loved the Indigenous perspectives and the way they made art accessible to my students.",
          "We had some guest from New Zealand come and preform Maori song and dance here. The management and staff were great. Recomend to all visiting",

          "This art gallery has very interesting pieces some of them are very old. The Flemish art section is a must see if you're into older drawing styles from the 1500s up to the 1800s. Very interesting, I would recommend.",
          "Not enough bike parking, and what *is* supplied is not visible enough to be safe from bike thieves. **And then they complain about us locking bikes in the safest location?? Grrr** \n\nBut do go see the absolutely fabulous Kentridge exhibit. \"Procession\" is incredible, the best installation I've seen since Lyndal Osborne exhibited.",
          "I LOVE LOVE LOVE our art gallery. I brought my class here for a field trip and they were enraptured. The building is engaging, the collection is diverse and the staff is knowledgeable. You can come here alone for a few hours and feel \u2026",
          "Always a delight to visit the Art Gallery. Friendly staff, clean facility, and visually stunning. The exhibits change 4 times a year, offering variety. There is also a children's room which offers creative stimulation for children of all ages. There are classes and events taking place constantly. Very much worth a visit.",

          "Never been before. Good time. Great programs for kids",
          "Unfortunately I cannot give it zero stars. They have the cheek to actually charge an admission fee - And the cheek to call it an art gallery. Perhaps Notley sold off all the real art to fund her spending spree? The random pieces of \"art\" \u2026",
          "Loved looking around at the art. They have special pricing for students, even out of province. Beautiful building.",
          "If you are an art lover, this place is for you. The architecture of this building itself is enough for anyone to visit and admire this place. It has a little shop. Right opposite the city hall. Very close to LRT. Entry few is around \u2026",

          "Beautiful and I love Churchill Square with the City Hall and Royal Alberta Museum in Edmonton Downtown!",
          "Canada Day at the Art Gallery was free and the yearly memberships were half price. It was busier than anyone expected. My family enjoyed the art and exhibits. I'd like to see more art and there is plenty of room for expansion.looking forward to my next visit.",

          "Very nice and knowledgeable staff. Amazing building. Great atmosphere!",
          "The attention to detail, overall presentation, and quality of people working here has impressed me on several occasions. Also, their events are very cool.",
          "As an artist, student of art, visitor of galleries across North America and Europe, and former museum employee of a world-class art gallery in DC (I know I sound pretentious...I'll remove my monocle now...), I can say this is an impressive space with interesting exhibits. Been several times. I'll probably go several more.",
          "The building is one of a kind but the exhibits are not especial, not worth paying 13 bucks at all. Take a photo of the building and don't bother going in.",
          "Lovely gallery.",
          "It was fine since today was free admission however little too crowded and some of the displays represented things i would not approve. Left very disappointed. The staff was great.",
          "We're not normally art gallery types, but our stay-at-home vacation in Edmonton gave us the perfect opportunity to change that. The new building is stunning, and though it's not really to my taste, it's good to see a building that is more \u2026",
          "Went there thinking we had a couple of hours but they were closing early. Everyone was extremely kind and the place is well kept!",

          "This place deserves 0 stars. The building is very interesting but the exhibits are ridiculous and they are not worth a cent that you pay for the admission fee. We didn't have much time and I asked at the front if it will be enough to go \u2026",
          "Beautiful day beautiful place \ud83e\udd70",

          "I wasn't sure what to expect from my first visit to this art gallery especially for a movie night. But, wow was Maude an amazing movie and the experience was great because of the friendly staff members. I'm looking forward to attending a few more events here.",
          "Very nice gallery. Well curated exhibits, very nice venue. I was here when the \"Songs for Pythagoras\" exhibit was running and really liked it. The building is very unique as well and is much cooler when you see the atrium from the inside. Worth the trip!",

          "Great place to go, lovely staff, super nice and informational. Quaint place to go, a bit more upscale than most as it's an art gallery although there is no dress code. Also the exhibits change frequently so you can see alot of different galleries. Always something new to see. Very welcoming environment.",

          "Cool architecture, enjoyed the artist in residence, but one exhibit was 75+ photos of subdivisions from the  90's. It was boring and not for the average consumer",
          "It's ok. For grown ups and a specific taste",

          "It's a terrific gallery. Art enthusiasts would surely love the art pieces and the place itself.",
          "In 2 floors of exhibits, there were only a couple of pieces I found interesting. I took advantage of the free admission on Thursday nights so that helped. If I\u2019d have paid, I would have felt sick to my stomach with the disappointment. Admittedly, I\u2019m no connoisseur of art.",

          "Nice art to see.",

          "Nice service, clean bathrooms.",
          "Always an adventure to explore the beautiful architecture and installations.",
          "Connaisseur d'Art will love this place. Though not big on scales and volume, it is is really great on quality of contents, what ever it has!!\nThe architecture of buildings, it\u2019s inside layouts, the ambiance, the displays and the guest \u2026",
          "Such incredibly diverse and fascinating art exhibits here! would love to visit again just to see what else they have in the future. keep it up!",
          "Multi-leveled attraction for sophistication and time killing. Interesting interior design of natural wood, concrete and aluminum. Has coffee shop on the top level. Areas for kids and rest. Exhibits depend on time of month as there are new ones being updated quite often.",
          "This is not a huge museum, and it does not have a permanent collection on display, as does the Glenbow in Calgary. However, its temporary shows are usually worth seeing. More than anything else, the building itself is a work of art, as is \u2026",
          "Beautiful building and an even more inspiring set of exhibitions inside.",
          "Some very weird \"art\" some other stuff was very good. The tribute to women artists is quite nice and educational. There is also a section with some first Nations art with Caribou fur which is also really good. Staff is helpful and friendly. \u2026",
          "My kids had a great time, and loved the hands on kids exhibit.",
          "It's not a huge gallery neither does it have the most riveting exhibits, but it is a nice way to spend a Saturday morning/ early afternoon to at least feed a bit of your artistic side.",
          "Love the architecture! I make sure that my guests from other countries see this whenever they visit Edmonton. Love the exhibits that change regularly. And it's free Tuesday and Wednesday nights!",
          "Waste of time, . This months art ???. Waste of money.  Not for children on their Summer holiday.",
          "Had a great time with my girlfriend here definitely recommend.",
          "Great place! Would be better if there was more paintings",
          "Really good art gallery. Sometimes the exhibits aren't my thing, but there is always a nice mix of modern, with some interactive, with some more traditional stuff. Very good building downtown.",
          "Very interesting displays, lots to see.",
          "The art gallery is situated in downtown Edmonton and in a spectacular building.  If you are an art lover then this is a great place to visit. They also have class for budding artists.  The staff are friendly.",
          "Amazing exhibits m,super friendly staff,very clean,great gift store with books,artsy kitchenware,art supplies of course,and so many prints! The exhibits were moving and you could tell that passion was everywhere. Would definitely recommend paying a visit.",
          "Pretty place to go when visiting Edmonton",
          "The art gallery is always worth going by! I go once a year and I love seeing the new exhibits.",
          "Expected more content. Not enough art being exhibited.",
          "We went to the art gallery with a group of friends with kids,12 in total, late at night- it was about an hour before closing.  We found there were plenty of room to spread out and explore.  The displays were simple enough to browse quickly \u2026",
          "If your looking for something to do, it's worth a visit. It's nothing amazing. Nice looking place. Lots of other stuff to do in Edmonton tho. But go ahead and check this out.",
          "Great place to visit, great way to spend the day. Staff were knowledgeable and very helpful. Interesting exhibits and a very nice building. Really enjoyed the Globe and Mail exhibit, very interesting and informative.",
          "Showed up for the Family Studio: Experimental Painting this morning with my 6 year old niece, to be directed to deserted rooms downstairs. Finally spoke to the security guard and another staff at the front desk when it was obvious the class \u2026",
          "Docent tour of temporary exhibit was well done. Permanent exhibit had an interesting way of using Canadian art to teach Canadian history. Nice mix of contemporary art installations and traditional pieces. Temporary photo exhibit (cutline) done extremely well, mixing multiple media to show history. Gorgeous facility. ",
          "Great place for family get together",
          "Excellent facility if you have a free day definitely a must see",
          "I like coming here; its a good time to dress nice and fancy, and enjoy Edmonton's features. It's very much based on contemporary and modern art, as well historical art.",
          "Fantastic space, with wonderful art and events that occur daily. Vibe which happens on the third Friday of every month is always worth checking out for some great music, food and drinks.",
          "An awesome place. What a gem in the Edmonton area.",
          "Exhibits change frequently, so visit often to see the different works. It's free for students, so bring your ID card and your friends. Fun and affordable outing!",
          "They do yoga at lunch on Mondays when the place is closed. So amazing",
          "This art gallery contains extremely diverse art and represents Edmonton's vibrant culture. Great for school field trips and tours, the exhibits have exceptional architectural aesthetic and a selection of unique masterpieces. A must see if you want to explore the culture of Edmonton's art!",
          "Once the new third floor exhibit is open I would highly recommend a visit. Peaceful, enlightening and thought provoking. A lovely afternoon.",
          "It's free for all Alberta students and youth! Awesome performance pieces and great art.  Definitely worth a trip with friends or for anyone who enjoys art. You'll spend about an hour or so here.",
          "The digital/analog presentation was a little too abstract for me.",
          "Great pieces, not sure if they had parking so we had to park a few streets away",
          "Definitely place to visit in Edmonton. Brand new gallery with very good art in it.",
          "Best option is to visit on Tuesday evening for a free pass and don't forget to take your child in art room for coloring n painting and also don't forget to visit 1st floor to view short animated films",
          "Love the exhibits, always something new and interesting. Great for all ages!",
          "Beautiful but the place to get coffee seemed to be absent. No bell to ring for service.",
          "My grandma was proud of me for pretending to have culture. Fantastic exhibits, knowledgeable staff, and there's a cafe!",
          "Absolutely lovely. Great exhibits",
          "Nice exhibits and it's free admission for students",
          "Keep going back. They refresh the feature exhibit quite frequently. I'm looking forward to our next visit!",
          "Attended many events there and the setting is always on point and the food was great.\nCheck out the onsite restaurant Zinc",
          "Amazing night out. Vibe happens every third Friday and includes live music, entry to the galleries and an activity. Wonderful vibe and a great opportunity to be out in downtown core.",
          "Love the architecture of this building and that most of their exhibits were by indigenous or Metis artists! Just wish we had gone at a time when more exhibits were open.",
          "While not always at capacity in terms of exhibits they offer discounted entrance when a gallery is closed. Their tours are great, I wish they had them more frequently on the weekends. The aga brings in interesting works and hosts fantastic \"refinery\" parties",
          "Terrible. All native American art, which I like, but I like variety more. Very bland and boring. Better off going to art shop in the west Ed mall",
          "The new Art Gallery building is nice unfortunately it's not that much to see inside. Some controversial Modern Art that didn't impress me at all. The souvenir shop was good though",
          "Cool place",
          "Love the exhibits, always something new and interesting. Great for all ages!",
          "I  have been here several times since opening.  Great place. Modern building,  great exhibits , rotating every few months . Is a different experience every time you visit.  Strongly recommend . Bring your family  ,  your children. ",
          "Cool architecture! Various styles of art! Hey yourself cultured!",
          "Friendly staff and good place to watch the best murals!",
          "Art, Music, food and fabulous crowd. The VIBE event had it all! Thank you Art Gallery of Alberta for inviting me to be your Vibe Artist. Thank you Manon Gaudet and Sofi for such a smooth and pleasant coordination. Thoroughly enjoyed working with you and everyone who joined for the calligraphy activity.  Lovely Art gallery indeed!",
          "Very small, exhibits could have been better quality. Was planning on having a wedding reception here, no thank you.",
          "Good gallery, primarily features rotating exhibitions",
          "Updated since my original visit of 1 star: The building is cool but the art is pretty crappy.  See photo. Also, There is a nice roof patio but it's locked. What's up with that? \nLast time (1 star) I didn't get in because it closed at like 5 \u2026",
          "This building caused a lot of controversy when it first was planned. One look at the outside will tell you why. While the outside architecture may be a bit out there, inside is beautiful. The art changes regularly so check the schedule. \u2026",
          "I attended a wedding at the Art Gallery of Alberta. The venue had a very industrial feel to it, which I did not like. The food was decent, but the service was excellent. A staff member would immediately clean up any spills or broken glass on the floor.",
          "Arts gallery is unique by its architecture",
          "Building is impressive but the minimal art on display was underwhelming.",
          "Beautiful galleries. Stunning exhibitions of local and Canadian artists.",
          "Gorgeous. Free for students. Worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful gallery. Exhibits were wonderful and there was children's programming as well. Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates art.",
          "Very cool building - interesting shows - it seemed liked there wasn't a permanent collection which was interesting.  Will come back when the second floor is open agajn",
          "Art work is a bit limited for a provincial art gallery but an entire floor was also under renovation at the time so that might have been the cause. Should definitely visit as a student since it's free",
          "ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place.  There is so much variety here.  If one room doesn't excite you, the next will.  Captures the love of art in everyone.",
          "Great space and gallery. We especially love the children's programs. There usually a small children's exhibit offered on the main floor, which is something that is usually not available at most galleries. They are quick to respond to inquiries and questions. Front desk staff vary in their ability, but overall usually very helpful.",
          "Compared to some other Art Galleries in Canada this one is often quite boring. They have maybe one exciting exhibit in a whole year. Last time I went to see the old Italian masters and it was fantastic, but other than that there is not much \u2026",
          "Would recommend to go when it's the free public admission day, unless u really love art",
          "Not worth the entrance fee. Some of the 'displays' just simply were ridiculous, for example: a pile of wooden match stick heads, some rotten, discarded plywood entitled ' found', and a dead tree branch.  Perhaps we are simple folk from the \u2026",
          "An annual membership is the way to go.  Especially if you have children the programs that are offered are excellent and engaging. The space is an injection of modern architecture in what is otherwise a dated but up and coming city of change.",
          "The women of Canada exhibit was great. Got to see some amazing paintings. But the rest was very confusing. Something you did in elementary school which I did.",
          "The AGA is great! I have only seen two exhibits here but have enjoyed them immensely! An awesome building that adds character to downtown Edmonton! A fantastic addition to the city!",
          "Amazing place. My kids learnt a lot about Edmonton and Alberta art history.",
          "To me art is about invoking emotion in the beholder. However the Emotions I felt were mainly Disappointment.",
          "The art gallery also has a really nice sun deck on the upper level. There is fantastic views of the city skyline and snacks, and beverages available to take a break from viewing the works.",
          "Amazing experience and a must visit for all art lovers.",
          "Great place for a date. They always have interesting exhibits and events. The gift shop sells a fun variety of items. I'm not a fan of the architecture, but that's a personal issue. ",
          "Very nice of Canada",
          "Beautiful displays. I love the interactive kids area and generous admittance fees.",
          "Went during family day and it was a zoo. Not the galleries fault other than they didn't seem to have control over the chaos. Building was beautiful but the holiday was not good for a first time visit. Will be back but maybe on a week day.",
          "Fantastic part of the city. Check back regularly!",
          "It was pretty cool.  We were looking for a different wedding venue!.",
          "I like it offer free admission to students. Wish it could show more items in the gallery.",
          "Boring, dull collection. It seems to be more interested in pandering to First Nations apologies rather than art.",
          "Its art. Seriously you can't go wrong with this place. A nice time and the have a free night once a month. You'll have to contact them as I don't remember the details.",
          "$12 for.... Two barely furnished rooms of art... And some random room full of photos. You're better off going to an art shop and looking at the pieces there.",
          "Ever changing collections with something interesting for all ages. Love the free entry nights and lots of updated activities.",
          "Beautiful environment, stimulates the mind and the senses.",
          "Incredible catering service in a stunning venue, Zinc restaurant at AGA has been turning heads and blowing minds for years.",
          "A good variety of artist works on Canada and Canadians including local Alberta native Indians.",
          "Very pretty building nice art",
          "Waste of my precious 10 CAD!!",
          "The gallery is small, but the exhibits change frequently. There is a hands on studio for kids to try different animation styles. Check out family Sundays and Tours for Tots (Wednesday mornings) for kid friendly activities!",
          "It was closed while we were in town, but it\u2019s quite a landmark. Perfect place for a walk and explore the downtown.",
          "Not very many things to see. My kids were not very impressed by it. A lot of money for not much fun",
          "I love this building so so so much!! Not only is it physically one of the coolest buildings in Edmonton, but the exhibits are always really interesting and diverse. Great way to spend an afternoon, definitely must come when in yeg!!",
          "I was surprised by the free arts and crafts when we visited on Sunday. My partner and I made etchings on Styrofoam pads and tried silkscreening for the first time! Those, and the timely cultural postcards inside the exhibits made for perfect souvenirs from Alberta.",
          "The exhibits change regularly enough and are quite varied. If the art itself isn't enough, the design of the building is interesting to observe as well. For a poor student, I especially love the free community nights every month",
          "The architecture of the building, outside and inside, is always worth checking out. And now the AGA offers FREE all access admissions on Tues and Wed evenings from 5-8pm!",
          "Mix of modern and classic art.",
          "not that many art works... some sections are boring... however there are some very interesting arts...",
          "The gallery this time has a few sections on photography(effects of settings) and both urban and rural landscape paintings. The upper floors have a survivability theme to it! Ever wondered how people survived up in the true north? They have videos of their livelihood (warning animal blood and gore) Come and visit the art gallery!",
          "Attended a work event here, food was amazimg, staff were attentive and the venue is stunning to say the least.",
          "This would be better if there was a variety of types of art so there would be a little something for almost every one. It was all very abstract, interpretive and \"weird\" when we were there.",
          "Not really moved by the current exhibits.",
          "Nice art gallery, is free for students",
          "I don't get art. Cool building though.",
          "I've lived in Edmonton all my life and have never visited the AGA before, so I visited and am writing this review from the rooftop terrace. The good news for everyone who's worried about the reviews saying they charge too much or that it \u2026",
          "The architecture is absolutely STUNNING. Definitely some of the best architecture in Edmonton and quite possibly Canada.",
          "There are quite a lot of handicraft. There is a shop too",
          "First time going here, I was pleasantly surprised. Exhibits were great, easy to figure out where to go.",
          "Disappointed! One hall was interesting. The rest was a poorly used waste of space. Alberta has some great artists. Its unfortunate that the space isn't better used to showcase it!",
          "Love this place always new things to see",
          "One of those must see places in Edmonton. Amazing exhibits and the building has an amazing architecture",
          "This place is filled with emotions expressed by creative minds. I love it.",
          "Beautiful facility with a variety of installations raging from professional international works to local immerging talent.",
          "Beautiful architecture definitely a must see in Edmonton.",
          "Don't expect to be impressed by anything other than the architecture and a single put together exhibit. Every other felt piecemeal or like very little to fill up the large exhibit halls.",
          "Love this place! Suprising very good quality of art collections in a 'small' city (pls execuse me cuz i am from Houston \ud83d\ude02). Their collection is amazing, the building design remind me of my favorite architect - frank ghery. Love everything in this place & Edmonton \u2764",
          "Loved the place.",
          "Good place for some introspective thinking. Beautiful architecture. Pop by on Tuesday or Wednesday when it's free admission. ",
          "Great patio for small groups. Ardbeg Day 2018 was held here.",
          "An art gallery with no permanent artworks in a truly signature style building located in the heart of downtown Edmonton",
          "I recommend the art lessons for kids. Emma is an awesome teacher.",
          "Very cool place and contemporary with great artists collections.",
          "Always great to go over there.",
          "An excellent gallery, BTW.  Go to any \"Capital Powered Art\" show (currated by the National Art Gallery) or any touring exhibit.  They're as good as art gets anywhere.\n\nNice architecture too!\n\nAaaaaannd... this is the place to book your \u2026",
          "Nice art gallery wondefully curated with great exhibits.",
          "Its a nice medium size gallery. There is a mixture of traditional painting styles to more abstract/modern styles. The last thursdays of each month from 5-9pm is free admission :)",
          "Excellent",
          "Second floor is the best, mostly canadian art, what one would expect. First floor has good variety of art. Third floor is contemporary art.",
          "Interesting art pieces. The building is quite beautiful.",
          "Everyone needs a good Art. Stop complaining, it's good for you.. go!",
          "The building architecture was more interesting than the majority of the pieces inside(at the time I went), but with rotating exhibits it's rather hard to actually rate the place based on what's inside.\nYou'll want to look into what's on display before committing to a trip through here. ",
          "Beautiful building and architecture, most of the exhibits were closed however.",
          "So disapointed with the art in this amazing building",
          "A good place to check out if you haven't before",
          "Beautiful building, but lacking in its volume of art.",
          "Great destination.  Highly recommend",
          "Zinc best food and atmosphere",
          "Interesting gallery.",
          "Not worth visiting as the selection is very limited and features paintings/exhibitions of very poor quality. The building itself is impressive from the outside and that's about it. The gallery should be made free to the public. It is not close to worth the admission price they're charging for access. ",
          "Not much to see and was disappointed in the layout of the pieces throughout the gallery. Expensive admission for what there is to view. Parking can be difficult and expensive depending on the day you go. Would not go again.",
          "Brilliant facility, great architecture, outstanding",
          "Amazing building, however would like to see more classical collections",
          "The exhibitions that were on when we went flew over our head on why they'd want to show them to the public as it looked like someone grabbed old farm nicknacs and put them on a shelf. But we'll continue to go and see more exibits",
          "Very clean. Relaxing and chill!",
          "It's was very strange , very interested in seeing more",
          "If you are looking to book this place as a wedding venue, it is a must. The setting is a decoration in itself. You will have minimum prep needed. Not much decor needed. Also the food was top notch. ",
          "Living in Montreal I found this place to be disappointing.  The montreal fine arts museum is on a different level completely for the same price. The only exposition worth seeing was the painting of the different regions of Canada. ",
          "A small gallery on three levels and doesn't take forever to visit. Love the modern structure of the building and saw some very nice work during my visit.",
          "Very few pieces of art. Not worth the trip. Beautiful building, they should find something else to do with it.",
          "Fun and interactive pieces, good for the family. Free on Tuesday nights",
          "Lovin' free Wednesdays and Thursdays!",
          "Awesome art gallery. Excellent place to visit. Beautiful building and ambiance.",
          "A solid collection in an even more stunning building..",
          "If you like art, you'll enjoy taking a tour here. Rotating exhibits so there is usually something new.",
          "Wasn't impressed by the exhibits",
          "Fun place to go if you're a student and looking to find a free place to hang out or go on a date",
          "You can actually rent original art for decent price (40-60 bucks a month).  My employer does this on the occasion.  Minimum 3 month rental.  Cheaper than buying thr painting and you can always change up to keep your office fresh.",
          "Two of the galleries were closed when I went, so that's where the fifth star was lost, but I adored the exhibition of Canadian abstract art that they had curated. The price is a tad bit steep for a smaller gallery, but it was a lovely couple of hours spent there!",
          "Enjoy the Arts, and changing the Artwork",
          "Great exhibits. Guided tours. Lovely building. ",
          "Interesting looking building but the exhibitions have been disappointing after the first few since it's opening.",
          "Amazing architecture, friendly staff and unique and creative galleries await you in the Art Gallery of Alberta!",
          "Nice place to visit but good for artists maybe",
          "I usually visit the art gallery on free nights. I'm glad they have nights like this so students and families on a budget can still enjoy the arts. The only downfall is it can get really busy and noisy. ",
          "At the AGA for a wedding. Beautiful paintings as to an auspicious day. Lovely place to visit. ",
          "Interesting building. A bit pricey for what there was to see inside. The boutique had some interesting pieces.",
          "Can you rate art? The building is awesome.",
          "Professional and was treated amazing for a novice to the Art world",
          "The art on display was very plain and over done, i found it boring. If you dislike the featured artist showing, there is no other options to look at. The whole gallery seemed to only be displaying political art.",
          "Was at a private function and it was a bit noisy.  The venue itself was excellent and definitely a unique environment.",
          "French Hospital",
          "This is an amazing, State of the art facility. Very passionate and knowledgeable staff",
          "Nothing too exciting to see.. admission is so expensive..  sorry to say but not worth it.",
          "Great atmosphere. Nice building. Friendly staff.",
          "Fantastic place to spend the night",
          "Stopped in to see the Canadian Women Painters of the 19th Century. Well worth a visit.",
          "Piece of art for art",
          "I like art. But most of what I saw was pretty rough and unpolished. I feel like way to many tax dollars went into this for what we are getting. May e one day I'll go back and hopefully add stars to my review. ",
          "Great building and great works of art on the inside. It is also and ideal place to host and event in Edmonton, Alberta. The only think that I think should be different is the placement of the building on the corner of Churchill Square. I would have made the choice to put it in a different location.",
          "Place is nice, but their hours aren't very good. Worth checking out though!",
          "Love this place!  I can escape away from the everyday life and enjoy art from different styles and ages.  The design and layout of the building is definitely something that is unique in Canada.  When visitors to Edmonton ask me what they should see, I always recommend checking out the AGA!",
          "Beautiful building, interesting exhibitions that are well curated. However the content is rather small. ",
          "Amazing, honestly I wasn't expecting it a true surprise, nice expositions inside, good use of the space and great structure a true surprise",
          "Nice gallery,great way to spend the day.",
          "Awesome. Google AI.",
          "Very nice and trendy worth checking out if you're in the area.",
          "The AGA always has interesting exhibits, worth getting an annual membership so you can go back again and again!",
          "Creative fun busy good atmosphere!",
          "LOVE the architecture and gift shop.  Some interesting galleries.",
          "Always a nice time",
          "Great place to visit with the family",
          "not the best use of space, felt relatively small and I was ultimately glad I went on a cheap night initially to check it out.  the exhibits that they did have however, were varied in their awe inspiring.",
          "The building is amazing, but the actual art is lacking.",
          "The scenery",
          "Great experience on family day for me and the little one",
          "A beautiful building and a unique gallery. Since opening again in 2010 after it's expensive renovations the AGA has become a Canadian architectural gem. It's also attracted many exhibits which change ever three to four months. You probably won't love all of them, but will enjoy most.",
          "Architecture of this building inside and out is worth seeing alone. Great galleries when we were there.",
          "Very educational, lots to see and a nice way to spend a rainy day. ",
          "Great place to visit! Don't forget Zinc Restaurant for a bit to eat!",
          "Had some training using the facilities at the AGA last week and I was thoroughly impressed.  If you need to host a meeting or small conference you should certainly consider the professional staff and beautiful surroundings of the AGA.",
          "Came here for a wedding. Nice space",

        "wiki": "The Alberta Aviation Museum is a museum in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is located on-site at the former Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport on the southwest corner of the field (11410 Kingsway Avenue).The museum operates daily except for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Alberta Aviation Museum hangar is the last remaining example of a 'double-double' Second World War British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) hangar. These hangars, built for the BCATP across Canada, were made of pre-cut wooden timbers of British Columbia fir. They could be built as single units, double units, and the 'double-double' which is four units.Built in 1940 after 3 double hangars for RCAF Station Edmonton, it was originally opened 5 October 1940 as No. 2 Air Observers School (AOS) under the command of Wop May. After the USA entered the Second World War the airport was used to service United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft heading to Alaska until the new USAAF base that was to become CFB Namao (now CFB Edmonton) opened outside of Edmonton and absorbed some of the traffic. Postwar the museum hangar was used by No. 418 (City of Edmonton) Reserve Squadron, Pacific Western Airlines and for Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) construction before becoming a car dealership in the late 1960s.Known in Edmonton as \"The Hangar on Kingsway\", it has been designated 'M' Hangar, Hangar #6 and later Building #14 by the Edmonton City Airport. It is now a designated municipal and provincial historic site.\n\n\n== Current ==\nWith the closure of the city centre airport the fate of the museum was, for a time, uncertain. However, since that time the building has been designated as a municipal and provincial historic resource. The Alberta Aviation Museum, now recognized by the Alberta Museums Association, will remain in its current location and act as a community fixture for the new residential neighbourhood, Blatchford.The museum hosts several groups including the 504 Blatchford Field Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Cadets, the 180 (20th Field Artillery Regiment, RCA) Royal Canadian Army Cadets, #700 (Edmonton) Wing - Air Force Association of Canada and 418 (City of Edmonton) Squadron Association.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\n\n=== Airplanes ===\n\n\n=== Helicopters ===\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe museum is affiliated with:Alberta Museums Association, Canadian Aeronautical Preservation Association, Canadian Museums Association, Canadian Heritage Information Network, Edmonton Heritage Council and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlberta Aviation Museum",

        "wiki": "This is a list of inclined elevators, organised by place within country and region. \nAn inclined elevator is distinguished from the similar funicular railway in that its cars operate independently whereas funiculars are composed of two vehicles that synchronously counterbalance one another. Despite this distinction, some inclined elevators use the term funicular in their names, which is seen in both systems converted from funiculars to inclined elevators, such as the Old Quebec Funicular in Quebec City and the Montmartre Funicular in Paris, and in systems built originally as inclined elevators, such as the 100 Street Funicular in Edmonton and the Ljubljana Castle funicular. This list includes counter-weighted, non-counter-weighted and climbing elevators operating on fixed and variable inclinations.\n\n\n== Africa ==\n\n\n== Americas ==\n\n\n=== Belize ===\nBelcampo

          "This funicular makes it easy for everyone to access the river valley system. The car is large enough to accommodate bikes. The one thing I would caution you about is that due to vandals it may not always be operational and it is not really good in cold weather temperatures!",
          "There is a beautiful view of the city, the space is gorgeous, but there\u2019s not much to do, at leats during winter",
          "We had a great little romantic walk down to the Edmonton River Valley. Started off at the base of the Fairmont Hotel Macdonald and walked down the beautiful stair case and out on to the platform. We then took the funicular back up to 101 street. Beautiful, fun and quiet!",
          "A hidden gem of the downtown, fun with the kids, and a great workout if you take the stairs. Waaaat???!!! That workout may be needed due to the frequent downtime, during which you can marvel at the custom glass and teak highlights that guarantee a high maintenance cost. Long",
          "This is a fun thing to do while in downtown Edmonton. Go see the centre of the city and then enjoy the view from the top of this attraction. Go down and see the lower river valley. And then go back up again. All well worth it!",
          "This is a free and fun ride. Situated next to the Mcdonald hotel, this ride takes you down to Fredrick G. Todd look out. The upper deck area, gives a great view of the river valley. The bottom area leads to the look out, and has a nice view as well",
          "I was visiting Edmonton this week and on Monday my twin brother suggested we go downtown as he said there had been a lot of changes since my last visit. He was right! He recommended we ride the Funicular (just behind the MacDonald Hotel) which we did. There is no charge.",
          "This was so cool! Yeah it may not be a big attraction BUT, it's super cool riding in this moving sideways elevator! And the view is stunning!! Well done Edmonton! The down part is (especially if you don't live in Edmonton ) you have to pay for parking! Park by the Big Hotel",
          "We had seen this featured on Amazing Race Canada, and knew next time we were in Edmonton, we'd have to check it out. On a recent visit to Edmonton, we did have time, and are so glad we went there. The entire area is well planned and accommodates all kinds of users, pedestrians,",
          "Broken quite often and super boring when not broken. Don't waste your time, there are lots of trails and other stuff around there.",
          "This is a small fun thing to try out if you are already close to the Fairmont and want to take in the view. This takes you down to the waterfront and the view is great going up and down, plus its free, why not riding it up and down?",
          "Take this (Free!!) Funicular down to the Frederick G Todd Lookout for great views of the City Skyline, River and River Valley.",
          "Its not an escalator, its not exactly an elevator, its a funicular! Cool idea for such a steep hill. Stops operating after 9:00 p.m. Lots of steps if it is not running",
          "When your legs are sore and you don't feel like doing more stairs, this is awesome. A great way to get down closer to the river.",
          "The Art Gallery folks recommended we check out the Funicular, so we did. Google told us it was open until 11, which it isn't, the funicular itself is open only till 9pm. That said the funicular is only part of the downtown to river edge access that the City of Edmonton has",
          "Parking is an issue. I dropped off the less mobile of our group off at the Hotel Macdonald and drove down the street to park at a meter. Very nice view. I was surprised to see how many people were taking bicycles up and down as part of their trip. It is free and I was thinking",
          "Take the funicular to access some fantastic river trails! Beautiful walk in that area. The ride is just a different elevator experience!",
          "If you travel to Edmonton you must see and try the Funicular for the view. I did this in the fall and it was lovely but any time of year would be spectacular. It is located beside the Hotel MacDonald, also a great please to walk through.",
          "Visited Edmonton during the extreme cold so I utilized any opportunities to be protected from the cold. I came on the bus 411 from Sherwood Park that stopped just meters from the funicular. The funicular is very slow in starting, I almost gave up, pushed the start button one",
          "We have used the Funicular on numerous occasions to easily access the Edmonton River Valley from the downtown. It is a gentle ride and there is a good scenic lookout at the bottom. The funicular can hold a number of people, strollers and bicycles.",
          "Despite not knowing any other traveller who has seen it working, the observation deck over the river is a good experience. If you are into fitness you will enjoy all the stairs. For the rest of us, it is some good exercise.",
          "Checked this out while in Edmonton and it was OK but would be definitely be worth it with young kids",
          "Beautiful entrance to access the Edmonton river valley...well lit, well used. Easy to find adjacent to the Fairmont MacDonald Hotel on 100 street",
          "We have now been 4 times to the funicular and now with trails open in the river valley this is great to use, if you live in Edmonton it's a MUST VISIT or if you are from outside of Edmonton this is the BEST STOP to see the river valley and city landscape from the trails in the",
          "The funicular is a great way to move people with or with bikes from the downtown area down to the river trail. While we did not have bikes we found that it would be an easy access point to get down the stairs to the biking trail.",

Even though I have lived in Edmonton for 40 years, I have never gotten used to the smell of the storm water runoff pipe by the Low Level Bridge.",
          "The elevator and the funicular provides people with limited mobility the chance to enjoy the beauty of the river valley. It will only get better as the leaves sprout in full. A fine addition to North America's largest urban park.",

          "A great way to see the river valley. Perfect to get from the river valley up to Jasper Avenue if you're on a bike.",
          "Short ride and slow. It's an attraction but one not really worth any excitement. Maybe if the ride was longer it would be better.",
          "One of it's kind in Edmonton. Takes you from top to the bottom in a minute. Big enough to fir 20 people. You can take your bikes or wheelchair easily in it. It's totally free for anyone however it's not open 24/7. Had a great experience \u2026",

          "It is still closed...",
          "Nothing too special about a rail elevator that goes as fast as you can walk up or down the steps it is beside. It is more of a fancy wheelchair elevator than a tourist attraction.",

          "The serenity of the frozen river at night, as well as the solitary coyote roaming around the river bank, was quite an unusual experience. The funicular worked perfectly.",

          "It's just a sideways elevator, but it's a cool sideways elevator",
          "Neat experience. Really unsure why they didn't take it all the way down though. You have to get off and take an elevator to get down to the valley itself. Nice views, but the city could have done way better for the money they spent on this, in my opinion.",

          "Love the nature of things, beautiful",

        "wiki": "Galaxyland powered by Hasbro, previously known as Fantasyland, is an indoor amusement park. Located in the West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the largest mall in North America, it is home to the world's tallest (14 stories) and longest indoor roller coaster, the Mindbender. It is also home to the Space Shot, the world's tallest indoor tower ride at the time of opening, at 36.5 metres (120 ft). The record was broken by Nickelodeon Skyline Scream at American Dream in East Rutherford NJ in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nGalaxyland was originally known as Fantasyland from 1983 to 1995. However, the name Fantasyland was already used for one of the lands of the themes existing in Disneyland and other theme parks, like the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland, Disneyland Park in Paris, Tokyo Disneyland, and Shanghai Disneyland Park, owned by the Walt Disney Company. A lawsuit eventually forced the mall's owners to change the park's name, though they were allowed to continue using the name \"Fantasyland Hotel\" for a hotel in the mall. Fantasyland became Galaxyland officially on July 1, 1995. This was celebrated with a new \"space-age\" theme and the arrival of the park's new mascot \"Cosmo\".\nOn December 18, 2019, it was announced that Galaxyland will undergo a renovation to be completed by late-2020, featuring new attractions licensed from Hasbro franchises. Balloon Race, Cosmic Bounce, Ropes Quest, and Zero Gravity are currently the only rides confirmed to be affected by the redesign.[1] The redesign construction begins in December 2019 with its grand opening as \"Galaxyland powered by Hasbro\" in winter of 2020.\n\n\n=== The 1986 Mindbender accident ===\n\nOn June 14, 1986, a wheel sheared off the last car on the train of the Mindbender and the train crashed at high speed into a concrete pillar killing three of the ride's occupants. Since then the ride has had several safety improvements including more routine maintenance checks and three emergency brake sections added to the track.\n\n\n== Rides ==\nThere are a total of 24 different rides operating in Galaxyland.\n\n\n=== List of rides ===\n\n\n=== Decommissioned rides ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Waterpark\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Galaxyland Website\nGalaxyland at the Roller Coaster DataBase",

          "In November, I visited the West Edmonton Mall, looking forward to time in Galaxyland and riding the deadly Mindbender. It had been years since the incident, but I was excited. A few days before arrival, I learned that maintenance had not been completed on the ride and would not",

          "It's a fun enviroment to kill time. However it seems like there are always rides that are not operating and yet they still charge full price. I would call in advance and make sure all rides are in operation. Best for young children",
          "This place is is fun and is a nice little theme park with something for everyone. There are lockers so you don't have to lug your purchases around while you have fun.",

          "Thought we would take our 2 kids 9 & 10yrs of age. Overcrowded, outdated, and the selection of things to do is minimal! I believe it\u2019s $160 for our kids to ride for the day... a total bore! Don\u2019t waste your money on this place. It\u2019s a huge disappointment!",

          "We were here with 5 children and 6 adults. In Edmonton for our father's funeral, we wanted a place where we could talk and let the kids be entertained. One adult and our 17 year old were with the children. Our children told us they really enjoyed the rides. There was a wide",
          "Great amusement park inside of North America's shopping mall complex. Obviously the prices are a little more on the expensive side of things but again it's way worth your money. They have a great variety of rides to try out from beginner to extreme attractions.",
          "This place is great. Everything in one area. All indoors and temperature controlled. They have Lockers to keep things safe. $8 for the day but worth it for bulky winter coats and purses. The food court is right next to Galaxy land. They have everything you might ever want to",
          "Personally I was not impressed with Galaxyland when we visited. The biggest roller coaster, Mindbender, was down the whole time we were there. Galaxy Quest was also down and there seemed to be issues with the balloon ride as well. There were pretty long lines at the other",

          "We had a great time. Rides for all ages. We have been here before when the kids were little, but now that they are teenagers they got to enjoy all the rides. If you are only going to do a few rides, the prices range from $5-$15 each. We got the all day pass for $50 so they could",

          "Had family over from Scotland, we brought them to Galaxyland! It was so nice to see things had changed with new rides mixed with the old rides! We all had an absolute blast. Prices are very right on point! We'll be back again!",
          "Great activity to do if the weather outside is bad. We went because we were visiting. We paid $50 each for 2 kids. I did not get a wrist band. We stayed 3 hours. The kids had fun on the rides, but I felt it was expensive. The lines were short, so we liked that.",
          "Trip advisor didn't give any information about where I should go to redeem the tickets (besides the address, and it is inside the mall), after walking 40min back and forth in the mall, because the staff also didn't know what to do with my trip advisor passes, I could finally get",
          "Our package from hotel was Galaxyland. We had so much fun. The rides you could keep going again and again. Was a great fun time with my grandkids.",
          "I was amazed that it gave me a similar thrill to an outdoor theme park. The rides are amazing and we had loads of fun.",
          "The Galaxyland is in the West Edmonton Mall. This is a great attraction for kids. They love it. They are well protected. All kids are having fun! They cannot be bored. There are several different possibilities. There is a lot of light as well. It is huge and it is fun!",
          "this is a great place for teenagers ..they can explore many rides and they are well amused , as I was traelling with the fine arts fieldtrip they were very happy !!!!",
          "Keeping it brief, just want to commend a young man operating the big roller coaster name Mcsween. He was so great, bubbly, and cool. We just dropped by the mall before our flight back home last April 24th. We\u2019re watching the big roller coaster running until that good guy got our",
          "I did get to look inside from a distance and thought it would be a great place for kids to have fun.",
          "The galaxy kid climbing area is awesome for little kids. It\u2019s free for 3 and under and $5 for older ones. Lots of great climbing and slides. Great alternative to th expensive ride passes",
          "Not a lot of rides for the younger kids. My teens are off on their own and they seem to be happy and occupied so that\u2019s good. Just wish there was more rides for the younger one.",
          "We bought 3 day passes to Galaxy land which was unlimited rides and one game per person for $50 each. We were there from 2:30-7pm so we definitely got our money\u2019s worth. Depending on the ride there was varying lengths of line ups but nothing was too long of a wait. There was",
          "Went mid-week and while it was cheaper than the weekend price it was nowhere near cheap. Afte paying $35/person entry, was advised that 3 rides were out of service. It took only a few minutes to realize that ther was at least twice that amount not available. The rides that were",
          "Oh no we had a really good family visit especially to galaxyland, where are we all, at all costs included, took a pass so we can go on all the rides early in the morning, so that we could miss the crowds later in the day. We all had a great time and rode many of the rides even",
          "Be prepared to pay!! No family or group discounts. Rides were not too busy for a Sunday. Everyone had fun, but was annoyed at the cost. I guess it does have high maintenance costs seeing as it does have a major roller coaster. My youngest daughter was allowed to go on rides that",
          "I took my boys 5 and 8 years old and they had so much fun. My 5 year old wasn't tall enough for most of the rides which was disappointing but my 8 year old had a blast! We went mid day during the week so it wasn't super busy and he was able to get one the rides fairly quickly",
          "I like how this place is indoor so we can enjoy it even when its winter. Just wish the pass is a little cheaper",
          "Swings were broken . Quirks and works was intermittently broken . All rides are double worked meaning each attendant has two rides to run. so we spent a lot of time waiting for rides to open in which some never did . Rock wall is never open m-th I was told . It\u2019s still a fun",
          "With this being our first time in Edmonton, we wanted to check out what was available within the mall and discovered this place. Although it was a busy evening (surprising considering it was a Thursday in February!), we bought an all-you-can-ride bracelet for $35 each. We had a",
          "We had a great time at Galaxy land. It has many different rides for all ages. The amount of rides is limited but still enough to enjoy a few hours. It was well worth the money as the lines were not long at all and our children were basically able to go on then turn around and",
          "Overall great experience, my children enjoyed themselves except for the fact that I had to carry our jackets all day long. We were there from the time it opened until the end of day. Definitely need more storage facilities or lockers on site!!",
          "I have been to the mall a handful of times, the last time when my daughter was 2... we didn't have a ton of time to spend in the park, but, wanted to ride the mind bender at least once... it was Really expensive for a single ride, but, the day passes were reasonable.... but...",
          "My kids are 14 and 17 and this was the first time we had been to Galaxyland. They kept themselves entertained from opening right through until closing with a couple of breaks for food and drinks. We went on a Tuesday as it was spring break for us, but it wasn't a holiday in",
          "Having established that everyone was tall enough to go on the \u201cfun\u201d rides we splurged and headed in! Fortunately we got there at opening and headed to the roller coasters right away to avoid line ups! We managed three popular ones. Who\u2019re the crowds descended! Zero gravity was",
          "An impressive amusement park, considering it is all indoors. Downside is that the rides are very expensive. Well-maintained, with friendly staff.",
          "Great fun. Lots to do. Great for families and kids, or just adults wanting to be kids. Haunted house is great, made my 30 year old male friend scream like a girl. Definitely worth spending a day at.",
          "Its fun when you go with friends and family. It can be you something to do in winters as it is indoors. Also this place hosta specific parties",
          "When I was a kid, we came here all of the time, so now my sister and I bring her children here and it is an age-appropriate place for them to have a great time. Held a few birthdays here. The rides are great, the playpen is very good for them to burn energy and there are",
          "I had never been on a roller coaster before and I did the one with the most g-forces hitting my skeleton. Will I be back? No, this isn't for me but I did see the joy and excitement in the faces of those I was with, which in itself was wonderful.",
          "If you have toddlers, they will enjoy the ballpark, it looks like the adults like it too, maybe cuz their kids are happy. Its enclosed and there is supervision. For older kids there are plenty of rides and arcade games to use. Prepare to spend at least a few hours there to get",
          "Great theme park to visit, lines move quickly and the staff are very efficient and helpful. Later in the evening there are no lines and you can ride continuously.",
          "We took our grand kids to galaxy land for the day when they visited. Great place for all ages to hang out . Our grand kids loved the day",
          "This is a wonderful place for familys to go.There are rides and entertainment for all ages..A whole day can be spent there.",
          "I have never known such short queues in a theme park and there are just so so many rides. We waited at times but it really wasn't unreasonable for a theme park. Something for everyone and once you have your wristband you can come and go til the park closes.",
          "Some of the most amazing indoor rides to be had, jump on the coasters and rip through the park at different heights and speeds!",
          "I had fun with my son at Galaxyland on a previous trip. My son has mentioned many times since about the \"Galaxy Orbiter\" roller coaster ride among others and I would agree with him.",
          "We enjoyed hours of fun with the kids and family members from Calgary. They have games and rides for smaller children as well. Safe and not overcrowded.",
          "Galaxyland has really stepped up their game and added multiple adult friendly rides - not for the light of heart! Tons of turns, twists and rotation will be sure to leave you feeling like a kid again!",
          "Galaxyland is truly a disgusting place. Now I know this review may seem harsh to the proud edmontonian, however, it\u2019s time to face it. Galaxyland is an overpriced dump. The one big ride that they have (the mindbender) has KILLED PEOPLE. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I live rollercoasters",
          "This is a must for all you who love Amusement Parks. The rids are all fun. After all these years the Mindbender Roller is still one of my favourites. As a former maintenance worker for the WEM I still am impressed how well maintained all the rides are at Galaxyland. All",
          "Nice attraction for kids, small area however its attached to a mall so for the amount of space available it had the variety of rides to accommodate kids and adults",
          "A large amusement park in the mall! Lots of rides and games to spend time with family and friends. Tickets are reasonable and rides are a lot of fun. Couldn't imagine the number of rides packed into this place!",
          "Galaxyland, was fun, check the height of the child as alot of the rides the child has to be a certain height. The price is a little high for the amount of rides but all in all we had fun.",
          "Great experience for the whole family with some fantastic new attractions. Amazing how they pack somany thrills into a small space",
          "A wonderful place to burn off some energy, have some fun and keep the kids busy so there's no complaining about shopping when you leave the theme park!",
          "Great variety of rides, from very mild to more extreme excitement. The gamers also loved the werewolves hunt and road warriors.",
          "I could not believe how many rides they fit into this indoor amusement park - rides for little kids, medium kids, and even a few for big kids. At $45 per person for unlimited rides, it was a decent deal to get my daughters each a wrist band and let them ride to their heart's",
          "Went here with the family and the sister in-laws family. Kids in ages from 5 - 12 and there was rides for everyone. Went on a Tuesday shortly after it opened. Lines were short, started to get a bit longer later in the day. Only part that sucked was the mindbender closed for",
          "I had a great time taking my niece and nephew to Galaxyland. Would recommend going early as it got busier as the day went on!",
          "We visited the kids play area inside galaxy land. The play area has lots of fun slides and a ball jumping area. Adults are free and kids are $12 over age 2. Great place to let your kid release energy.",
          "Busy, busy, busy and so noisy. Our son didn't want any part of it. I have been to the mall 3 times, the first time when I was about 10 so almost 30 years ago and I have to say I was really surprised how little the main parts of the mall had changed (water park, mini golf,",
          "We were spending a rainy day in the mall when we happened on this amusement park. It is not huge, but it has enough rides to keep a family with kids happy for a rainy or snowy day.",
          "Great rides and the whole family had a lot of fun. The place was pretty clean overall and the staff were mostly very courteous and helpful. My only issue is that, compared to my last visit, there are a lot more seats on rides marked as Out Of Service for Maintenance, which is a",
          "Love taking my kids and now grandkids here, great way to spend a day and have ability to ride the ride all day with a day pass. Very reasonable and so many choices for people of all ages. Right beside it is a large food court and the mall itself has many food outlets and",
          "The grandchildren went here when we stayed at West Edmonton Mall - they loved the awesome rides - better than the PNE in Vancouver - had lots of fun, we loved they could go down and send a few hours and then go back on their own (they are 13!) back and forth all day, price was",
          "We visited this place 6 years ago when our girls were all under the age of 12...they loved it, playing the games and going on the rides...We spent the whole day there and I remember it did not cost us much...this year, we came back for a visit and I couldn't believe the prices",
          "Galaxyland is a fun and highly recommended place to go. We are just here for a couple of days and just drop by the mall. We just bought points to let my sons experience the roller coaster for the first time. The roller coaster mind binder is amazing, and the extensive amounts of",
          "This is a good amusement park but the rides are a bit dated. There are a few ok rides for the older kids but you will run out of rides in a couple of hours.",
          "We visited Galaxyland on a Saturday and lines were short, probably because it\u2019s summer. It only has a few fun rides for teens and adults. We spent 2 hours there and was able to get everything done that we were able to ride. Mind Bender Rollercoaster was awesome and a must ride!",
          "Lots of fun but the noise will get to you after awhile. I prefer breaking it up rather than spending the whole afternoon there.",
          "The ride passes are definitely overpriced and the games are all at an extra cost. We entered from the parking lot directly into Glaxayland and it was by a steep staircase (no ramp/elevator) and then we had to guess where to go to get our wristbands. Make sure to wear runners and",
          "Unfortunately for the cost of Galaxyland, it is juts not worth the $ when you have children who are a little older. Unless you have kids who want to go on the same few rides over and over again... there just isn't enough of an offering for preteens & teens. It is great for young",
          "I went with a birthday party for my 8yr old autistic nephew and 10yr old niece. We had a good time up until we had to meet at the party room at 4pm sharp we were told. Not only did we end up waiting way too long Outside a locked room but when we found a staff to explain out",
          "Took my daughter here for some shopping and ended up on the roller coasters. If your kids are bored of shopping, buy them a pass and let them do the rides if they are old enough. They have a couple full size roller coasters and a bunch of rides for the smaller kids. These roller",
          "We had a pretty good time here. We found the wait times for some of the rides a little irritating, but it's assumed when you are at such a touristy spot. It's a fun place to go, but probably won't offer any thrill seekers much of anything. Of course this is understandable",
          "WE stayed in the Fantasyland Hotel and checked out Galaxyland to see if it would be okay for our 3 year old granddaughter and her parents. The rides for toddlers are somewhat limited but there were enough to keep her going thru them for over 4 hours. Our daughter was pregnant so",
          "Our 4 year old really enjoyed Galaxyland. It is spendy and there are restrictions on a number of the rides, but we enjoyed our time. It is very loud and there are lots of lights. The cosmic bounce was a little too scary for our boy so the ride operator stopped the ride to let",
          "Came here during our visit to Edmonton to play for the day, and boy did we have a blast! We made it on nearly every ride and could have stayed longer but unfortunately they had to close at some point. It's a great place to feel like a kid again :)",
          "Great day out for kids of all ages. Proud to have an indoor roller coaster. Can get day pass. Kids just love this place. Has an ice cream store just outside",
          "Though my kids loved Galaxyland, I feel it is in desperate need of an update and a really good cleaning. They have had minimal changes since I was there as a kid...20+ years ago. However the kids (ages 3, 7, 8) really liked it.",
          "My family of four had such a great time this past weekend. My daughter loved the smaller kid rides/options and my son went on all the scariest rides and loved it. Very impressed with the new additions in galaxy land as it has been years since I\u2019ve been there. Loved the rides,",
          "My son wanted to go on a few rides while we were at the mall and this was perfect for him. We walked around and checked out all the rides and then he decided on a couple of them and we purchased the ride tickets for him. As we weren't going to be there all day we did not",
          "Galaxyland is divided up by age appropriate rides which is nice. None of the rides are terribly scary, but if motion sickness is a problem there are a few to stay away from. From stuffed animals to ride, to a giant roller coaster we had a fun time trying out as many rides as",
          "Visited with my 4 and 2.5 year old in February. First time for us as the kids have been too small in the past. They are both pretty tall so were able to go on a good variety of rides. It was really good in the morning but in the afternoon got quite crowded which was overwhelming",
          "The rollercoasters were great and there were other interesting rides; however, many were closed and the place seemed dead...didn't give you that amusement park lively experience.",
          "Of course this can't compare to outside theme parks like Six Flags, but even so, I and my daughter had a great time visiting this park. Especially the large indoor rollercoaster was a thrilling experience.",
          "March 30, 2018 Since it was spring break we arrived before Galaxyland opened and we were the second people into the park. We rode many rides alone with no line for quite some time before the park filled up. By noon the lines started forming and by 1 the lines were very long.",
          "Make sure you get the day pass! Our 3 year old absolutely loved it! There is plenty to enjoy by the entire family, young/old. Lots of variety. we went during the week and it was not very busy. All staff are very friendly and professional. The place is well-kept and it's indoors!",
          "Overall, we had fun even if we only did 2 rides. We didn\u2019t see the point in buying a full day pass because it is SO pricy. Therefore, we got tickets for the rides we really wanted to do which was still expensive.",
          "The prices are ridiculous and they never have all the rides in operation on the same day. We only come once per year. If my daughter didn't love it so much, I'd spend my $ elsewhere. I definitely understand why most locals avoid it.",
          "Great place , keeps the kiddies entertained while the wife shops, makes for a good day out. Fun rides, and games, even has a roller coaster",
          "We spend a full day at Galaxyland with children ages 10 & 8. There is something for everyone. It got busier after 12pm (we were there on a Saturday) Clean and well run",
          "We were there as a family of 14. (6 adults, 4 tweens and 4 children). When you pay 45.00 per person, I think they could give you some coupons to use in the booths that have an extra charge to play. For example, the climbing wall and the dart/gun booths. Isn't $45.00 enough for",
          "Galaxy land was an exciting experience! They have lots of cool rides and a food station too. The only thing is that you need to stay together and some of the people that worked there were very unfriendly. But I enjoyed the experience and won't forget it soon.",
          "This is a fun family and young children attraction. Going early in the day will mean less crowding. Weekend are busy but week days are better for traffic. The roller coaster is big and exciting. Just spending a short time seems to be unlikely if you buy access pass for the",
          "Absolutely amazing experience, rollercoaster's indoors. thoroughly enjoyed our time at Galaxy land and we will definitely be back. Great for couples or families. Unmissable when in Edmonton.",
          "We took our children (6 under the age of 10) to Edmonton and spend the full day at Galaxyland. We bought each child an all access pass, and went on a day where, lucky enough, it was not too crowded. We thought we would only spend a few hours here, then the rest of the time",
          "There is tons of rides and rock climbing and rope climbing for the whole family to do! Lots of fun and can keep a family happy for hours! Highly reccommend.",
          "They're updating which is good and bad in my opinion. I miss the days of the rocking ship that would eventually go asl the way over. The role coaster is fun but beware you're probably going to come off it sore or a little hurt in the back/neck area. It's great if you have kids",
          "Fairly expensive for the day pass and not many rides for the small kidos but good if you like roller coasters. Food court was handy with a good selection of food options and lockers for your things.",
          "Had so much fun with the lids. But very pricey to go on thr rides. Its like 60 per person. I would recommend regardless kids enjoy the rides and its in the mall.",
          "I enjoy taking visitors to Galaxyland. There are lots of rides and they try to keep the lines down. There is always a ride to enjoy and something for all ages including my favourite - rollercoasters.",
          "Something for everyone to do at West Edmonton Mall. Its a great day get away. The grandkids go on the rides, the ladies shop and the guys visit and watch the kids. Nice to walk around and have lunch. We are looking forward to getting the loyalty passes for shopping between",
          "Can't believe how much fun we had. Almost no lines for any rides and none for games or food. Lots of fun for kids if you want to pull them out of school for the day, it's so worth it.",
          "We came to Edmonton for a Christmas trip with our three kids ages 3,4 & 5 . They had never been on any kind of ride before, so this was a big deal. They rode rides from open till close, non stop (10am-7pm). They loved it so much and want to come back already. My youngest was too",
          "Brought my young kids 1 and 6 years old, both had a blast. Was able to go on a lot of rides with them. We stayed in the hotel in the mall, after the younger one went to bed, I went down with the older one and played some more until close. Great day. New wrist-bands instead",
          "Went on the BIG roller coaster in the back with my wife and it was amazing. Really scary and mind bending. Dont think Ill do it again but wow that was insanely fun.",

          "We went for work event where they booked the whole place, so I'm not sure what it would be like when open to the public. My review is only based on the rides we went on. Mind bender - lots of fun (first time was awesome, second time knocked my head around so much - hence the",
          "Two.of us are in our mid 30's and one.in mid 20's and we had an absolute blast! Literal a lit of options for age groups about 7 and up (not a whole lot for toddlers but who does). Staff incredibly friendly, better now then when I was a kid!",
          "Got the 7 day pass while staying at Fantasy Land. Teens could come and go as they please. Lots of rides packed in area. Lots of fun for all.",
          "I went through here while at the mall. It was pretty quiet with some of the rides not operating. Probably an option for a younger crowd.",
          "Had so much fun here with my niece. The day pass wasn't that expensive we spent the whole day there.",
          "Galaxyland has more attractions for younger kids and just a few rides for adults. However, I am so amazed at how they creatively made space in such a small area. They put alot of imagination weaving roller coasters and attractions in there. I'm am impressed with their",
          "On a rainy day, took my son and his cousin to Galaxyland for a \"day of fun\". Lots of options for them as they are both now of an appropriate height to go on most of the rides. Great selection for an indoor amusement park. Very noisy - if you have an issue with loud noises, I",
          "Given that this isn't Disney land I'm amazed at the prices here. Not cheap to entertain or eat and the rides are what I went on in sixth grade",
          "I am NOT a fan of amusement parks, and I still enjoyed walking around this unique place. Mix of modern and outdated equipment. Fun arcade. Helpful staff. Clean. Busy and noisy, but like no other.",
          "Fun place for the family. Get the day pass.Lots of rides for all ages. No line ups during the week..",
          "My family had a blast with the rides. The roller coaster was intense according to my daughter but enjoyed it!",

          "great rides and things to see and do make this a worthy stop if your are at WEM. Definitely worth a family visit,",
          "Went on a monday and got the $30 value pass since they were only open noon to 6pm. This even included one carnival game and I won a prize for my daughter *flex* ;) Overall this place is pretty much for kids. There's only a couple true thrill rides. My favorite attraction",
          "Galaxyland is apart of the full West Edmonton Mall experience you can do your shopping and then hit the amusement park for the kids all under one roof",
          "This is our third time visiting this place. The kids love it. We spent 8 hours in the park enjoying all the rides. Highly recommended",
          "I saw many people and families. It is more for kids to be honest, the rides present not much of challenge.",
          "As Calaway Park regulars, we didn't know what to expect for our weekend away at WEM. We loved it! Got there at opening time and spent the first 3 hours with very low crowds despite it being a Saturday on a long weekend. My thrill seeking 5 and 8 year olds found the scariest",
          "Went with two teens (17 and 15) and got them the wrist band. We went fairly early in the am and the lines were minimal so they got a lot of rides in early on. They started out on the Space Shot and moved on to the Galaxy Orbiter. They thoroughly enjoyed both and went on the",
          "was about $50 per person to do an all day pass, but worked out to much cheaper than if you want to go on any of the big rides individually (about $12 per ride). Was still a fun day and the rides were well worth going on. I had a headache from screaming and laughing so hard all",
          "For an indoor park in has some good rides. Like the water park, some of the rides are showing their age.",
          "Fully indoors so it's fun in all weather!, the rides offered provide thrills and excitement for all levels, the roller coaster is nuts! Reasonable prices and ride all day passes make for a fun family outing, with the mall right outside, your choice of lunch and shopping is",
          "The best thing about this place is the kiddie rides let you participate and join the fun with your child. From the mini ferris wheel to a speeding rollarcoaster.. be sure to eat after you leave if you plan to ride.. and don't forget the wave pool.. that's a blast as well..",
          "This was my first visit to West Edmonton Mall and Galaxyland. I was not impressed at all with the Haunted House in Galaxyland. First, it costs $8 a person to go through it and you have to confirm you are over the age of 16. Don't waste your money, it was not worth it at all. I",
          "Our 4 year old son had a fantastic time while we visited galaxyland. Not so much for younger kids but still well worth a visit. Pretty expensive though.",
          "Clean and rides for everyone, hard to get grand children out after grandparents finally wear out LOL. Great value. Kids say it was best part of holiday.",
          "This amusement park is great for kids of all ages. There are rides that appeal to all levels of comfort with rides. It's worth spending a few hours here if you're in town with kids. We try to go as soon as the open and get out before it gets really busy.",
          "Extraordinary games that would blow your mind and make you laugh out loud , really loud.Located in the Mall, you can enjoy meals around and shopping.",

          "Generally speaking the park was OK. We went with two teenagers and both of them had fun, but they both just wanted to leave after trying the rides once. The overall atmosphere seems to be more geared for smaller children. It could also use some modernizing, as I remember",
          "This is a great way to spend an afternoon with the kids. The lines are non existent, and there's something for everyone's age range and ride preferences. If you are choosing between this or the waterpark though, go for the waterpark. The big roller coaster is intense!!! Be",
          "We took our 4 year old son for the day and he had a blast! Went on a Thursday and it wasn't too busy. We went on every ride our son was tall enough for. The ride attendants were really good. Only frustrating part is the height chart before you go into the lines for the ride was",

          "We had lots of fun for two days. Our kids for the most part were just big enough to go on some rides. Had we not gotten the multi play pass we may not have done this. The place is very clean and looks to be in good shape still.",
          "Unless you've got some kids between the ages of 6-12 this place is a complete waste of time and money. Plenty of better things to do in the mall.",
          "We bought tickets online and saved 10%. Not a whole lot of rides but enough to have some fun! We spent an afternoon and we all enjoyed it. The roller coaster is pretty action packed for the size. Lots for young kids. It's nice because you can take a break, go in the mall",
          "We live in Edmonton and never come because it is ridiculously overpriced! A few renovations were done and Boom! Price skyrockets. Even if you don't want to pay $40 for your kids bracelet, each ride averages $5.",
          "Old rides and not so much exciting new rides but I had enough fun winning a lot of tickets and getting so many prizes! My 13 year daughter enjoyed some rides and games as well. Price is reasonable I would say especially being indoor, if comparing to many other playlands",
          "Galaxyland is an indoor amusement park in the West Edmonton Mall. It has a variety of rides from child rides to adult roller coasters. Tickets were 4$ and most rides required more than one. An all day pass was 45$. I found the park too expensive and not worth the price.",

          "Went there during the middle of the week. Rides still had some people on them. The kids roller coaster was a little short but fun for them. They have gotten rid of the drop of doom which was a bit of a let down. I would suggest getting a pass if you plan on spending any amount",
          "The fair games and arcade games were quite enjoyable. My Husband had lots of fun. He went on the new zero gravity ride and could've kept flipping upside down the whole time. I wasn't in much of a mood for rides, so I watched, but I did enjoy the arcade games. It would be quite",
          "If you aren't planning to ride the rides, you do not need to purchase a ticket. If you have little kids that want to play in the Galaxy Kids play area, bring socks for everyone. Kids over 12 can help supervise, but not run around through the tunnels. Great value for the price",

          "Overall our visit to Galaxyland was a lot of fun. Our 4 year old had a blast and because we visited on a weekday lines were not a problem at all. The only problem with a weekday visit is that the staff are often taking care of two rides so one is closed while the other is in",

          "Fun time with the fam out at Galaxy land. This park has been around for years it they continue to update the system and rides so it keeps people coming back. Went with a toddler and younger child. Both had lots of options to choose from and lines moved fairly quickly.",
          "Park was fun for the kids. Looked almost the same as when i was a kid 20+years ago, except a little more weathered... Could use a little updating. Travel tip: buy tickets online ahead of time and save 5 bucks per person.",

          "Twas a good experience however there's a lot of attractions that have to be paid extra from the passes",

          "We came on a moderately busy, rainy day. Line ups for some of the rides moved VERY slowly. Some of the rides were not in operation when we arrived, but opened later. The Mindbender is definitely worth riding. Great indoor rollercoaster. As amusement parks go, probably best",

          "It's a great place for kids. Keep an eye on them though as it is VERY busy. Rides had no lines so I'm assuming it was people just looking. It is VERY expensive for being an indoor amusement centre. It cost $35 for my two kids to have two rides each.",
          "We had a blast at Galaxyland!! This was our second visit and I'm sure we'll be back. There is so much to do for all ages. We spent the entire day there, only leaving for dinner.",

          "I have been to galaxyland many times and I still am surprised at how loud it is. My older kids like the big roller coaster and my younger son likes almost anything that he can ride. It is expensive, but so is all of WEM. Kids play area is more expensive than TreeHouse and",
          "Don't expect Disney class rides, but it is very clean and well maintained. Most of the rides would appeal to younger kids, not much for teens and adults except for the roller coaster. I brought my kid here about 8 years ago before this visit. As a teen , it just didnt have the",

          "Fun park for younger children. Our 11 years old loved it, the 16 year olds enjoyed it for about an hour. Staff is friendly. During the week the ride lines are short. Nice way to spend the day with young ones but be prepared to deal with many 3-5 year old that aren't being",
          "This is a small park in the mall and is noisy and busy. It is all very cramped together which makes it hard to find your way on to the rides. The Mindbender coaster is iconic and is a good ride, just a pity about the painful and unnecessary shoulder restraints. The Galaxy",

          "Galaxyland is a small, indoor, but well-designed amusement park, that is especially fun for the 8-11 year old crowd. Those younger can't go on all the rides and so get a bit disappointed (or are intimidated by all the noise) and those older find the scene a bit boring after",
          "HUGE amusement park in the middle of the mall, how cool! Without the 2 day family pass this would have cost $189 for 4 people. Pros: Lots of fun rides for all ages. Line ups not too bad. Can come and go all day. Cons: Expensive, very loud.",

          "My two grandkids ages 7 and 8 loved every minute of our time here. There were enough rides for kids of their ages to enjoy. They loved the bumper cars and the plane carousel ride and many others. I is even better for ages 10 and up. We all had a fantastic time.",
          "I haven' visited Galaxyland probably in 2 or 3 years but I still get amazed about the way the rides are build, this park was extremely well thought and designed.This is the largest indoor amusement park in North America, with more that 25 rides and attractions. I'll mention few",

          "More than enough to keep you busy here, but the lines can be a little daunting by the middle of the afternoon. Go early and get your riding in before the crowds hit.",
          "Having an amusement park indoors was pretty cool. The roller coasters were great. Other rides were more geared to younger children. If you go early almost no lines. If you dont have much time maybe just get points rather than a pass. Pricey as the rollercoaster is $12 per ride.",
          "This indoor amusement park is a great way for the entire family to spend the day! There are many rides and attractions, so there's plenty to do throughout the day. There is a various variety of rides to choose from and i would highly recommend getting a full day pass for the",
          "I was not able to ride the rides, but I couldn't believe how much fun it was to watch the kids have fun! Yes, it is pricy, but worth it. Make time spend the day here.",
          "The two big rollercoasters that Galaxyland has to offer are one of the best rides that Canada has to offer but the rest of the rides are not exactly thrilling. The rollercoasters are $12 each and are well worth the money (instead of getting the $45 day pass). My one criticism",
          "The small train was pretty cool, IMO. As was that game where you shoot those red lights out. Of course, I don't recall any of the names of these rides. Been here a few times.",
          "Took my daughters (3 & 5) to Galaxyland on a Thursday afternoon and it was fairly busy but not overcrowded. My daughters enjoyed everything they went on from the train that circles the amusement park, to the carousel, bumper cars (2 different sections) dragon wagon roller",
          "We brought our 1 year old and it was great! We were amazed she was free plus a companion so we only paid $5 for an extra companion! There were several rides she could enjoy and she was so excited to see all the lights and rides. The play area was geared towards older kids but",
          "The kids really enjoyed their time at Galaxyland and could go on almost all of the rides, except one for my daughter. We got there shortly after opening on a Sunday, so it wasn't too crowded at first and the line-ups were short. We had used our Air Miles to purchase a family",
          "I came here with my family including a nephew at age 15 and another at age 10 and it was really quite fun! They have a neat little variety of rides for the younger children and a few higher adrenaline rides for the older in the family. It is a tad expensive per ride but is still",
          "This place is bigger than we thought. It has an area from young children, many rides, an arcade, haunted house, and a little train going thru the area among others. The atmosphere is not as great as Disneyland of course, but you don't have to wait 45 minutes for a ride either.",
          "Galaxyland is a highlight of West Ed mall for the kids. There are many rides, an area partioned for the young ones to climb through tunnels etc. Remeber to take off all shoes so have the socks ready. Tons of games and our grandchildren loved it.",
          "Great place for fun with grandkids. Lots of rides, games of skill (some of which were not included in the ticket to get in!) It was noisy but the kids loved it. Loved that it was by the food court!",
          "My grandson wanted to go to the water park and Galaxyland at WEM recently as he was in my care as his parents were away for a few days! It's wonderful spending time with a grandchild! Had a great day and went out for something to eat! Spent a whole day at WEM but even one day",
          "Kids under 10 need 3 hours tops after that it's sort of becomes aimless wandering because each ride has been done 2-3 times. We have 3 under 7 and they enjoy themselves up until about that 3 hour point. Our teens stay home they don't bother anymore. I do try and look for",
          "The Galaxy Kids Playpark within Galaxyland is a great area for little kids. They have two ball pits and many things to climb and slide down. My 15-month old child had a lot of fun while we were there. The things to climb are large enough for an average size adult to go with",
          "If you can not go to Disney I would recommend going to Galaxyland is good. Getting tokens are better to go on rides whether then getting a pass. The rides are pretty fun and good for the price.",
          "This is the amusement park inside the West Edmonton Mall. It is aimed at children but there are still some rides that will get the heart of any adult racing. Admission seemed a little overprice for a pass. I bought points instead and just rode the one or two rides that I wanted",
          "I brought 4 kids here for the day, ages 11, 9, 9 and 7. It cost $200 for general passes for the kids and they could go on unlimited rides for as long as they wanted. First, this place is dingy and run down. It was like being at a travelling carnival, sketchy. It's poorly",
          "There were many rides/activities that appealled to all 3 of my post high school \"kids\", especially the roller coaster where you could sit facing backwards (and not see where it was going).",
          "I've been going to Galaxy land since I was a child myself & still find it to have a certain sense of wonderment now that I take my son there from time to time. It's a bit costly so it doesn't happen too often but the attractions & midway games are definitely a great time.",
          "If you have kids you really do need to spend at least 1/2 day at Galaxyland/Fantasyland to experience what set West Edmonton Mall apart when it was built! It is fun.",
          "There is a plenty for rides for any age group. Our 5 year old loves the bumper cars, the dragon mini roller coaster, the train and pretty much all of the other rides. We usually go there once or twice a year. During Halloween week it gets pretty scary with monsters walking",
          "The Galaxyand theme park at W.E.M is a must do if your going to the beautiful city of Edmonton since it's in the best mall in the world!!!",
          "I had a fun time here with my toddlers. A good selection of rides and games for both younger and older children. My only real complaint was how loud the music playing from the speakers was. Honestly, with the noise from rides and excited children, you don't need to add to it.",
          "The galaxyland indoor park has the world tallest and longest indoor roller coaster. Expensive but worth it. The part located inside the West Edmonton mall. This is really a nice place to drop off your kids while your are shopping.",
          "I took my Physics 30 students here for a field trip and it was awesome! WEM provides a full lesson and booklet for all the students and a great admission price for a school trip! The students really enjoyed it and I can't wait to bring more students up next year!",
          "My daughter, my wife and I paid a visit to Galaxyland this last Sunday. We had so much fun. Fun for the families. Thanks for the event planner. It was great and well organized . Can't wait to go back",
          "This place is way over priced just for your kids to have actual fun it will cost you 50 per child to have fun. NEVER AGAIN. Rather go to calgary to calaway",
          "I'm here with friends and my daughter. Got in on a business discount. As I'm not too fond of rides anymore (other than Disneyland) I have to say these are great for kids of all ages. Cleanliness is average. It would be good if the mall had staff use an air or water hose to get",
          "this is where i love to go with my friends, although its a little expensive its worth the money! a day to have fun and spend time with family",
          "This attraction can suit all families! If you're a thrill seeker they have a crazy roller coaster or milder kids rides! Great for a rainy day or to just thrill things up on your trip!",
          "The kids love Galaxyland! Good value for the money when you buy passes, or better yet have them comped. Many rides to choose from for all ages and a large climbing/play area for the littles (just be sure to wear socks as they require them and removal of footwear to play.)",
          "Galaxyland is mostly for younger kids than older (except for the roller coaster). When we went few rides were closed because they were checking it for repairs.",
          "Needs facelift Dirty, paint peeling, floors falling apart, rides old and worn looking. Costly however same as most amusement parks No wow. Good for rainy day. Something to maybe do every couple of years but many other entertainment in Edmonton to do Expect to spend Food awful",
          "I took the grandchildren ages 14,10,and 4. It was the most fun for the 4 year old, as they have the most available for that age group. They have a few rides for the older ones, but once or twice on the ride then it gets boring for them.As for the little ones it's good, but very",
          "Quite a few rides under construction right now. A ride pass is great for kids my 8 year old was able to just stay on and ride numerous times! The indoor playground was definitely a hit! The staff working the ticket redemption area lacked any kind of customer service but the ride",
          "9 dollars per person for one ride (which means 36$ for a family of 4 for only one ride), this is not what we call family friendly. Of course, we can buy an all day family pass for 150$, but there is not a lot of rides that are exciting to us. We like high and fast roller",
          "I took my daughter and her friend here for spring break. Not the most ideal time to go, was very busy!! Also if your child is over 48\" tall be prepared to pay the adult price of $45 for the day. At first I was a little put off, but even for that price they had hours and hours",
          "We were there right at 10. It wadnt busy and we didnt have to wait at all for rides. I recommendd this for 3 and above. There were a ton of families with huge strollers holding newborns or very young toddlers. Save your money and annoying others wirh stollers everywhere. The 3",
          "This is the second time I've brought my kids. They were 2 and 4 the first time and they are 4 and 6 now and they have tons of fun! We had to ride some things with them because of their hight, but there is a ton of stuff for the to do. We spent $75 on 2 wrist bands and they were",
          "While a little expensive. I think it rivalled Disneyland in that department, it's a lot of fun and the lineups are a lot shorter. People tend to enjoy working there, or at least they pretend to quite well",
          "Beautiful place to visit for kids, young and seniors.It brings back your childhood and relieves stress and depression in the snow clad Edmonton in December.",
          "This used to be the highlight of the mall. A fresh adrenaline filled, attraction filled area with one of a kind rides. The only ones left standing are the original mind bender coaster, and the spin coaster. Sadly, the place us showing years if neglect. Burnt out lights, dust",
          "My kids (5 and 6) had fun for the first hour and a bit, but the novelty wore off pretty quickly. There isn't much for younger kids to do (that isn't painfully dull), and a lot of the rides were \"under maintenance\". If you are looking for a Calaway Park experience... it isn't.",
          "Went with family. We had two hours left in the night before closing but still had to pay for a 3 hour pass. Should be discounts. Single tickets cost more. Rides for the six year old were either too babyish or too scary. Older teens and brave people would enjoy the roller",
          "Day out with some friends...it was way too busy in there, rides too expensive....but it was nice to see my friends go on the dollar coaster!!",
          "Gone here many times over the years. Seems to be more kid oriented now. They have taken out a few of the scarier rides. The roller coaster is still a must try.",
          "My wife and I were there with her nieces. They were disappointed with the rides which are poorly maintained and they were not very clean.",
          "I was super excited to take my son to Galaxyland and share my favorite ride with him, now that he's tall enough for the small red roller coaster. I should've checked online first. It was closed. I know rides have been shut down before, so I should know better. It's just really",
          "Very well made for kids. every kid will like to visit whenever they see this place. First of all very huge mall and well planned",
          "Did a family weekend at WEM. Got the family pass and spent a day using Galaxyland. Probably hadn't been there myself in nearly 25 years. Looking at it now, not sure that its changed much in that time either. Its an old fashioned theme park, and there's actually quite a bit",
          "Took grandson to Galaxyland but found it so expensive we couldn't go on many rides. Just the bumpers cars cost $12 per person for just a few mins. Most rides weren't even open.",
          "The mind bender is so much fun. One of the best roller coasters ever. They even have free rides for kids. A must see!",
          "i understand its Feb, poor weather why not go indoors and spend a few hours entertaining the kids, but its very expensive. should try to get coupons in advance or find a deal package in advance cause if you just show up, its not cheap",
          "A must do when you go to the mall its a blast with all the rides for young and old. Games to play makes you feel like you are at a carnival",
          "We visited over February long. Overall, we had a good time. Staff eerie knowledgeable abs friendly. The only issue we had was with being told to find the guy in the yellow (this was in the games area). We had a few issues with games not working and he was the person who fixed",
          "Have been coming here since it was called Fantasy Land now my kids get to enjoy it and enjoy it they do.",
          "With multiple rollercoaster, and interactive rides this is a great place to spend a day with the teenage kids. We started at 11:00AM and the next thing we knew it was 9PM. The lines where manageable the staff friendly and helpful. Reasonably priced and easy to get around. We",
          "again, this attraction was totally worth it because of the package we got at the fantasyland hotel. it definitely is not an \"all day thing\" but we came and went throughout the day, to avoid line ups. The roller coaster is intense! and there were a few options for those in my",
          "Went here with the kids and while they enjoyed a few of the rides, the experience as a whole was quite disappointing. Parts of the walls were torn out for \"renovations\" I'm guessing. Everything there has been there since the 80's and it just had a general feeling of cheesy!!",
          "We spent the day at the park with the kids and everyone had a fun time. Our main complaint was that there were not enough operators for the rides. They would have one person operating many rides so you would get to a ride and there would be a sign saying that they were at",
          "We visited Galaxyland a couple of days ago while on a family trip to West Edmonton Mall. We have a teen and a 6-year-old, and there was lots for both of them to do at the park. There are renovations currently underway and a couple of the rides had been moved since our last visit",
          "My daughter always has a great time. If you can go on one of the discount evenings it is good value. Full price is pretty high.",
          "Been here about 12 thousand times, being that I am from Edmonton, and last lived there about 10 years ago. West Edmonton Mall has everything you want to do outdoors in the summer under one roof in one of the coldest places in Canada during the winter, (South of 60). It can be",
          "Took my little niece and nephew they had A BLAST. From decorations to the rides they loved every second of it. Highly recommend if you gotta entertain young ones. Would defitnetly bring them back.",
          "There was lots to see. We were in the mall for 6 hours. We saw the seal show. I was glad we didnt pay to sit in the stands as there were many great places to see the show for free. Underestimated how long it would take to shop and experience everything. We went mid week. By",
          "It's nice to have access to Galaxyland year round and while it's big with lots to do the atmosphere is lacking a little. Maybe if they brought in carnival food, dirt floors, and a rodeo it would bring back the wonderful memories of childhood summers.",
          "I volunteer with Big Brothers. A keen 12-year-old and I went to Galaxyland today. The rides ranged from those for little children to a few that had me frightened half to death. The kid enjoyed them immensely and went on a couple of the worst ones more than once. What an",
          "Went during the week. Park has less staff on week days so rides open on a rotation basis which works out fine . Staff is friendly and cheerful. Only bad part was when we told them a games was not working (game costs $2) and was just eating kids money, they left it open to",
          "Kids love this place...adults not so much. The place needs to be updated and since all the rides are indoor it's very noisy. On the upside children 2 and under go on the rides for free with a parent (parent is also free). If you have little ones 6 and under I do recommend the",
          "Fun if you want to spend lots of money. Rides are old and need to be refurbished or at least cleaned. It reminds me of a fair but indoors. It could be great again if some time and money were spent.",
          "We purchased tickets for here and the water park from the Fantasy hotel where we were accommodated however the water park was closed due to a private function therefore our energy was poured into this fantastic indoor amusement park, the good lady was put off by the energy buzz,",
          "The best way is to get the family unlimited pass. Make sure to go online to see if any of the rides are closed for repairs before going.",
          "This was a trip to West Edmonton mall and Galaxyland for my 2 five year olds birthday, their first time at the mall and first time at Galaxyland. When buying all day wrist bands for the kids, I specifically asked if I would be able to ride with them on some rides as a single",
          "Our boys are too small for about 1/2 the rides but there is a play place that they just love but don't forget to bring socks.",
          "I dunno, it's pretty old and worn out seeming. The galaxy theme has been in here for 20 years! It looks like nothing has been updated at all in that time. My 4,6,8 year old said they liked it, but after waiting so long to get on some lame looking ride didn't show that they",
          "This is a great place for families to spend the day (great rainy/cold weather activity). My kiddos love it, and get super excited each time we go. We don't make it a frequent activity, however, as the cost is a bit high. Expect to pay extra (over and above the ticket price)",
          "I took my young boys. There were enough attractions aimed at different ages to keep everyone happy. It is pricy but the boys likes it. I would say next time buy all day passes so you don't have to pick and choose rides",
          "a nice treat for your kids on a cold day being indoors, it has too much to offer, I recommend to kids, teens and family times.",
          "Very nice games for all the ages from kid up to adults. There charge fees. There is a food court near it as we as wash room. The roller coster looks scary!!!",
          "On Sunday we took our family to Galaxyland, and it started out as a really fantastic day. Trick-or-treating was a really exciting surprise for the kids, and everyone including Grandma enjoyed the rides, and the fun house was an instant hit! Then.... the haunted house. Now, to",
          "At West Ed you can find many things to do besides shopping. One of them is Galaxyland...This entertainment center has rides for all ages. You can have your caricature done, while others taking different rides, or eat at the food court as well. Many rides have hight restriction,",
          "Fun place for the family. Some adrenaline rides & some layed back. Lots of kiddi rides for the children. Gaming areas. Recommendation: need a scarier of atleast comfier rollercoaster, my focus is always on my neck pain when going around the course.",
          "And they desperately need a face lift and hard renovation on the rides. Galaxy land has become old and worn out and they need to spice it up. They are slowly losing business and its incredibly expensive. The massive roller coaster is the main attraction. They have enough rides",
          "Rides looked fun and was mostly targeted for young children. There were two roller coasters that looked like it would be fit for those young at heart. However, I wouldn't compare it to the excitement offered by theme parks. There was a corner of ticket game machines that",
          "This place really needs an update a very boring run down park in the mall. Save your money go to Disneyworld.",
          "Family, Friends, Couples, Singles EVERYONE is bound to find something they love to ride here. Great atmosphere and wonderful rides.",
          "Wow to be a kid again . LOL... The rides , the music, the games the food this place has it all . Excellent vacation spot and kits all INDOORS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
          "Always a fun place to take the kids! Buy a day pass to keep them occupied all day. Rides are great, good range from little kids to adult. Lots to do!",
          "Many people confuse Fantasyland, World Water, and Galaxyland. If you're not sure which is which please use the mall website to figure it out! This is the amusement park that is in the mall. There are plenty of rides for children and a couple of adult rides.",
          "Buy a pass and ride all day, great family fun must do is the roller coaster, this is a well worth the money",
          "If your kids are old enough and tall enough, buy the all day pass and let them have the run of the place. So glad we bought the unlimited ride passes for them. Bumper cars, swings, roller coaster, train, driving track... Our kids ran from one ride to the next and had a blast.",
          "over rated, way over priced, was expecting more but was disappointed. the place was cramped and could have been better set up",
          "This is part of the West Edmonton Mall. Good, lively adventure park for the whole family. My children and I go there often and we love it! I recommend.",
          "The rides are plentiful and they have enough for different ages and height limits. While we were there they had a Hockey Shot on Goal concession that came with a free coupon. My kids enjoyed the free one so much that they begged us to do it 2 more times. Galaxy Land is always",
          "This place has lots to offer. There are rides for children and something for everyone else, a haunted house, bumper cars, and games. For thrill seekers there's the giant triple loop roller coaster, and the space shot. The lines are usually short, especially if you go later in",
          "A lot of fun for young ones and adults. A day to spend with family, without a doubt. Rides for little ones to enjoy and adult thrill seekers.",
          "Went on the last Friday afternoon before the end of summer holidays. Wasn't as busy as I expected but that's definately not a complaint. Took 4 kids under 8 years old and they had a blast. All 4 had wristbands for unlimited rides. We had to buy a few ride tickets as one of the",
          "It's really nice. The kids loved it! If you plan to ride all the rides, it's better to buy the pass.",
          "Visited Galaxyland with my 9 year old daughter. Wished we could have stayed the entire day - in which case I would have purchased the all-day pass. My daughter loved the intermediate roller coasters. She had such a fantastic time on the Ropes Quest -- she spent 20 minutes on",
          "Great assortment of rides and fun things to do for the whole famiy... Definitely is worth the visit!",
          "Lovely place to visit for all the family. We attended with 3 young children and they all had a great time. Great value for money.",
          "Galaxyland, while tight and conjested, is ran by professional and polite people who take care and pride in the facility. It is nice to see that, besides the usual favourites, there are changes made to the attractions, so it's not the same show every time you visit. If you are",
          "Was quite expensive but we had so much fun! The spinning roller coaster was crazy fun. The ride that shoots you straight up was so scary but worth trying at least once! My kids had a wonderful day!",
          "Fun for the whole family! This place is huge with tons of rides for all ages. If visiting Edmonton be sure to check this place out.",
          "We spent the evening there with our 2 and 4 year old. Our 2 year was free for the rides she could go on a parent was free to ride with her. We all had so much fun. There was a fair amount of rides they could both do. Was worth ever cent.",
          "Galaxy land theme park is good for young kids plenty of rides aimed at under 10's. Visited with family, not many queues as the weather outside was hot. Wouldn't pay for a adult day pass though as there are not enough rides to warrant paying for a ticket.",
          "Went as a family of four. Admission cost was $157. Kids enjoyed a lot, as did the parents. Husband rode the roller coaster and said that it was fun. Lots of rides for all ages. Lots of games for all ages. I would definitely recommend for all ages.",
          "For a family of four and one senior was so expensive, $200. At least we did not wait for any rides and we could stay on again and again! That was a bonus!",
          "If you'll have a chance to visit this place - do it !! Great fun for all ages and everything under the roof. No matter if it's winter or summer - you can be a child there all year round.",
          "We went on a weekend and there's a long line up on the rides.. Rides - limited for adults/teenagers Location - crowded and rides are sooooo close to each other. For a claustrophobic person like me, I can't last long inside the amusement park - the noise of the machineries and",
          "If you plan on spending any time at all then you'll have to suck it up and buy the unlimited ride pass, cheaper online and also if you purchase at your hotel ahead of time. They have an affordable evening rate as well. Buying the single tickets will only be a deal if you want",
          "While visiting the mall we decided we had to go on at least one ride. It cost $18 for 2 of use (6 tickets each) I guess worth it to tell people at home we went on a roller coaster in a mall. The best part was spending $5 on Plinko at the entrance and winning a free mini",
          "I do enjoy coming here and I am sure tourists enjoy it, however I can not believe how expensive it has gotten. Especially for the size. It is definitely not worth the money. The lineups are always long so the amount of rides you actually get in a day are limited. Next time I",
          "The name speaks for the price. This is one of the most expensive amusement park we've ever been. Being an indoor amusement park inside West Edmonton Mall doesn't justify that they're better than Nickelodeon Universe inside mall of America. The price for a family of 4 is a",
          "Given that we had 3-4 hours, we decided on an unlimited ride pass for our 11-year-old for $45. This proved to be a poor value decision. Most rides are so understaffed that it takes an incredibly long time to clear previous riders and get new riders in before starting the ride.",
          "Had a few hours to spend at Galaxyland with my 10 year old in July, 2015, and she LOVED it! For about $25, she had hours of fun, going on ride after ride. Line ups weren't super long (but we were there on a Thursday afternoon and not on a weekend). Would recommend for sure!",
          "I went with a few friends because we got free tickets. Was a little bit below our age level (23), but it's sure to be a hit with kids.",
          "Luckily my brother-in-law had connections so that I was able to get free passes to take my three girls (11, 9, 6) and two nieces (13, 11) to the park. The girls loved it. The older girls went on the Orbiter a couple of times and the Space Shot. My six year old liked the smaller",
          "I should have researched the rides before I bought a family pass online ..... This place is old and not many actual rides. Mindbender was excellent but down for routine checks often .. Not worth the price !!!",
          "Everyone should ride the indoor roller coaster at least once. It is a thrilling ride. However other than it and the space shot, there isn't really many \"thrill rides\" it's more of a park for young children. Quite expensive for a pass for the day unless you go on one of the",
          "Was visiting the mall and absolutely had to do the 2 more adult rides here, the triple loop roller coaster and the orbiter. Both were great fun and I bought the coaster photo afterwards. This place is best for kids really and a wristband/unlimited entry may be best but I only",

          "We went with our 3 year old niece and she wanted to play the arcade games. Most are 50 cents a game. With the help of grandpa and auntie, we played one game where the joystick didn't work. We told them and the attendant let us choose another game to play for free. We played",

          "Of course the kids enjoy going here but it gets boring once you visit a few times. The small children will most probably spend the majority of time in the playground. Remember socks are required in there and parents must stay inside the fence with their child.",
          "No lines on the rides first thing in the morning. Later in the day the park got crowded and lines started to get longer. The kids had lots of fun. You need to get a day pass for $45 and ride as much as you can. Some rides cost $10 each when buying tickets.",

          "Rides are separated into areas for children and adults. We had wristbands to ride unlimited rides for the day. Better value than paying for individual rides. Arcade are is fun. Limited food for purchase but it is right beside a food court so you can eat virtually anything.",
          "When it is cold outside and need to get the kids worn out, this is the place to go. The big roller coaster is the best, if not somewhat scary",

          "I have been here a few times with my children, but more decently was over the long weekend just past. The kids love galaxy land. It's enjoyable for them, and me as a parent love to watch them enjoy themselves. However, the staff attending the rides are anything but pleasant. You",

          "After spending the day at the Waterpark the kids decided that they would like to at least do the roller coaster.. so we forked out 31.00 for three people to go on a 2 minute ride. Wow (Do you see the sucker written on my forehead). The roller coaster WAS amazing and the kids",

          "We enjoyed an evening at Galaxyland for a school fundraiser. We had fun in the smaller roller coasters and just wandering around. Decided to visit the Haunted Castle. I think we might need some therapy after that! I'm in my 30's and my step daughter is 16 and we were terrified.",
          "Easily can spend more than three to four hours enjoying the rides. On weekends, try to get there at opening and enjoy the shorter waits especially at the bigger rides. Later on, it can be quite busy. All day passes gets you into most rides including the haunted/fun house.",
          "We went to galaxyland on Friday afternoon. Some of the arcade games ate our coins. The prizes for the tickets weren't very interesting. The advanced rides were fun. If you aren't sure, but just want a couple rides, buy tickets instead of a pass. A couple hours is all you",
          "Located in the West Edmonton Mall and open all year long with plenty of rides for all age groups. I enjoyed the Mindbender, Solar Flare, and Space Shot. A bit too pricy for the duration of the rides though",

          "I took my two-year-old here and he was totally excited about it! There are little trains and rides for kids that age up until adults! There are many many people here, however. The noise is a little overwhelming, but I think it is a good idea for the little guys to check it out",
          "The family pass is great for a family of four and allows you access to a day of rides with the kids. There are quite a few rides available including a small oval race track that the kids absolutely loved. It was very busy due to time of year but all of the rides were open and",

          "A perfect place to get an adrenalin rush safely. With a wide choices of attractions for kids to adults, from mild to wide, from fun to really crazy. This is a world glass place at its best you can enjoy year round.",

          "Was here as a kid and have not been back in around 12 years. The giant boat that flips over is gone, and the drop of doom old style one was a lot more fun.. The kids areas look better witch is good... They should have more opened during the week or have times for all the rides",
          "It's large, it has lots of things to do for all the ages and it's in the mall! So you can have a break for lunch and don't need to go far and will definitely have what to choose from. I will never get tired to go to the Galaxyland!",
          "We've been to galaxyland several times before, but this time we were pleasantly surprised to see that the 3D show has been revamped. It now features wind and lighting effects, as well as moving chairs and has become an interactive experience thanks to the laser guns at every",

          "The phrase 'like a kid in a candy store' definitely applies. Our son had an amazing time on the rides and playing games. The ticket redemption store is a little on the cheap side so would recommend playing the squirt/water gun games to win a stuffed animal prize instead of",
          "Galaxyland is a fun time all around. They have rides for all ages, sizes, and level of ambition. As much fun as this is though, compared to other venues I found it quite expensive and there are still a good load of things in Galaxyland that still need tickets and money invested",

          "I thought this place was a waste of money. It was not well maintained, which made me wonder about the safety of the rides for kids. It cost a bomb to get in, and the attractions were nothing you wouldn't find at your average midway carnival. Total rip-off.",
          "While some people seem to be complaining that there is nothing for adults and the place is boring, you have to keep in perspective the following things... 1) yes the facility is old, the whole West Edmonton Mall is old and sees thousands of people each day. The whole place",
          "So i get, the place was awesome back in the day when they build this mall, but come on, they really need a splash of color, or t least clean up the place, i took my 4 year old daughter and paid $75 for both of us to ride on some of these rides, cause of course she cant ride on",
          "We had free passes or it wouldn't have been worth it. My husband and I are larger people but not huge, and we got kicked off of one ride because the chest harness would not do up over my boobs. The rides also seem cramped into a very small space for what is there. We got on",
          "Our local mega-amusement park costs almost $100 per person, food is astronomical in price, and the line ups are long. At best, you get 10 rides per day. I read the review which said this was not a good deal. We paid $150 for our family of five for a day pass. There were",
          "Galaxy land is pretty awesome. The rides are awesome and I really like it. The best part if it, it isn't really crowded but it's pricy. If you do go try every single ride because you paid for it kids seem to really enjoy galaxy land. Anyways enjoy",
          "Slightly disappointed in galaxy land. This park is in dire need of maintenance. Many areas seem abandon and forgotten. Admission is very pricey given the amount of rides that were active. Seems as though this whole park needs an entire makeover. Kids loved what was open but",

          "When an attraction like this is available in the West Edmonton Mall its worth stopping by to check out. I didn't do any rides but other family members did. We played the games where the machines spit out tickets that can be used to get a trinket. The games are a lot of fun",

          "There's something fun here for people across age groups. I loved it",
          "I wore shoes, I wore a shirt. There was no policy about pants so I assumed (like I'm sure many before me have) they were optional. I have never been more embarrassed as I was that day being escorted out of the kidzone.",
          "Great place to take kids when cold winter hits us outside. There is so much to do and lots of different rides for all ages. We are local and bought annual passes. We go here once a week with our kids. Clean bathrooms. Only suggestion would \u2026",
          "First time going here in many moons. Employees were friendly and my daughter had a blast. No complaints.",
          "I've been there before but it's the best amusement park I've ever been to it's the best place and it's one of the biggest indoor amusement parks in the world it's also connected to a mall called west Edmonton mall and theres other \u2026",
          "Been going here since I was a kid and it\u2019s always fun. For sure need to ride the mind bender it\u2019s probably one of the best parts",
          "Galaxy land is still a great place for kids of all ages.  I've been going here since it opened almost 40 years ago when I was a kid and now I take my kids here.  The playground ballpark area offeres great value for younger kids compared to \u2026",
          "This is the place most loved by my kids in the West Edmonton mall. I personally love to join them and have some adventure too. Yet, I can say that the price is quite high when it comes to playing only the last 3 hours prior to closing. \u2026",
          "Great attraction and fun. Expensive for average people like us.",
          "Galaxy land is awesome! A little expensive for such a dated venue, but it's fun and lines are never too long. Worth a trip!",
          "An amusement park inside a mall? It's a great spot for the family and date night when it is cold outside.",
          "Great park for small or older children. The park offers several different rides. There is also a food court located right off the park with great choices for a quick meal.",
          "Awesome!!!... My kids love it. There is a lot of fun and games. It was fantastic!!!..  My kids are finally (exactly) the right height to go on the rides.  It was wonderful so many rides for all of the different sizes and ages. I arranged my \u2026",
          "Great family fun! Need more benches for parents to sit on!!! Otherwise fun time had by all.",
          "First time being there. Took my daughter and we had a blast. There are wait times for the rides yes, but not as bad as the exhibition in saskatoon. Also you can leave and go shop and come back and still ride the rides.",
          "Kids and adults love it. Toddler area is super fun and free for little ones under 2! The rides are awesome and lots of variety. 10 year olds literally can spend a whole day here and never want to leave. Two recommendations: sanitizing \u2026",
          "Love this place kids absolutley love it they got cool rides and even adrenaline junkies will find the perfect rides there. Lots of new rides but the interior themes especially the little train needs  updating it's getting outdated however \u2026",
          "I'm sure it's pretty good. Everyone I know likes it, but since I'm stressed out by roller-coasters, I personally wasn't a fan.",
          "Great place for kids to play and enjoy indoor ride all around the year.",
          "Great for my grand son and myself. \nLots of exciting things.",
          "Great indoor theme park! They have the roller coaster for $15 which is great. If u live outside of Edmonton don\u2019t miss that. Kids were having a lot of fun.",
          "Nice place to enjoy for all ages. Galaxy land should work on concept of annual pass similar to Wonderland Ontario . Make it more affordable",

          "My best vacation so far. A fun place for a weekend getaway.",
          "Really loved it here my son had so much fun as the had alot of rides to keep him entertained and happy. He can't wait to get taller so that he can ride the bigger rides.",
          "A fun place for sure! Doesn't take to many rides to pay for the day pass, definitely the best value for money. Very loud though, could use some sound dampening maybe?",
          "Good time with the kids. Everything was open except the little red roller coaster. First time on the big coaster for my son. Good safety practices but they certainly take their time.",
          "Good selection of rides. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Some areas could use a little more cleaning. It would be nice if they could expand the park and add more rides. That said, there is enough here to keep you busy for a full day. Lots of fun!",
          "Mind bender is worth a visit. Wish they were open late on weeknights.",

          "I like this attraction at West Edmonton Mall.",
          "It is impossible for me to take my 4 kids to galaxie land. It cost me 200 d just for tickets alone....this is the reason why it is so slow\n....reduce your prices and have more happy people in.",
          "A good place for the family. It is undergoing a change soon.",
          "It's a great place for the kids when there's no sickness going on",
          "Always better to go during weekdays to avoid long lineups and crowds. My 7 and 3 year old love going there when we are in Edmonton.",
          "Great place for children. Price of rides is quite expensive however it\u2019s great for a rainy afternoon. The big rollercoaster is a favourite for many and there are quite a lot of rides for younger children! Would recommend if you\u2019re looking for something to do in the winter",
          "I've walked through a few times. Lots of things to do with children of all ages. Great to bring a date if you are young.",
          "Fun for 2yr old and yes i had fun as well.\nTrain was the best.\nThey need more and better rides for 2yr too say 4 or 5 yr olds.\nOverall was friggin fun.",
          "Galaxy land is a lot of fun, and a great place to check out for an indoor amusement park! The haunted house seems really cool, but I'm 21 years old and still too scared to go in. Hoping that one day I get over that fear. also i love the swings and the little train forever and ever.",
          "Indoor rides in a mall. Need we say more?\nKids love it. So if your planning to go to the mall with kids there going to want to go on the rides so be prepared to bring some money.\nThey will love it though I know my kids sure do and every year we go to Edmonton and visit the mall it's a go to for the rides.",

          "The rides are so fun and the kids love it there\u2019s also lots of rides that my 5yrs old can do. But the only thing is that the bump car rides don\u2019t allow my 5yrs old ride it. I hope do something about it. But the experience is awesome. :)",

          "Awesome rides, busy place! Family would love it",
          "What a cool place to hang or when it's freezing out side",

          "Whenever my family comes here, we have a great time. There are a variety of awesome rides and games. Kids aged two and under are free. However a parent needs to purchase a chaperone pass, which was $18 the last time we went, to go on the \u2026",

          "Nice roads and its getting a makeover for a new attraction soon",

          "Great place to take the kids lots to do and cant wait to see it updated!",
          "We came for the whole day, so we got day passes. We didn't have to wait for any rides first thing in the morning, but there were lines later in the day as the park filled up. The park is clean and well maintained. The staff seem well trained and quite professional.",
          "One of the best game places in Canada with an indoor roller coaster ride! Amazing!!",
          "I shouldn't have to pay for a pass to go on the rides with my 1 year old. It use to be free and it should go back to that. $20 to take her on one ride ?",
          "Great for kids under 3 years old, lots of fun free rides",
          "I took my boys 5 and 8 years old and they had so much fun. My 5 year old wasn't tall enough for most of the rides which was disappointing but my 8 year old had a blast! We went mid day during the week so it wasn't super busy and he was able \u2026",

          "Pretty cool rides, but be warned if your kid isn't 5 feet tall most of the rides are off limits",
          "Love it, such a fun place, good variety of rides for all ages. Can be very busy crowds but some of the ride lines you can walk straight on. A very cool and colourful feature to add to West Ed mall",
          "Fun but should and could add more space and rides \n\nBut I gave 5 \ud83d\ude0a",
          "In My Opinion This Place Is Really Fun, A Little Expensive But Not The Worst....Lots Of Rides (unless your to tall or to short) But If Your Going On Vacation To Edmonton I Would Recommend This Place Or The WaterPark",
          "Very fun place and easy to spend an entire day at. Six or seven big rides for the not so little people, but most of the rides are for smaller kids. The lines weren't too bad either.",
          "Place is for the fun loving and adventurous people of any age or group",
          "Definitely a must when going inside the park. Its beautiful and there are rides available for all ages. I, myself can't decide if I had more fun just looking at the park or sitting in the rides.",

          "Its was amazing it cost $ 50 there is so many dangerous ride I just took 4 and I was almost shaking amazing experience",
          "Kids and adults all had a great time. Lockers were available for rent, and there were fountains by the washrooms. Staff was very helpful when we had questions. Most rides had a place to put your backpack or footwear while you went on a ride. The rope climbing needed runners, not even buckled sandals was allowed.",
          "Love this place! I especially enjoy the arcade part of it LOL. There are so many games! Rollercoasters, and all these crazy adrenaline games, lazer games, and a lot of other things.",
          "This was an outstanding place to spend a day. There's no other indoor amusement park like it and it was a great way to get out of the weather and have some fun. The roller coasters are a blast!",
          "Prices are out of this world. I\u2019d give a 5 star if prices could be dropped. How can I rate when I don\u2019t have enough to try the rides out.",

          "A large amount of rides to go on, and not too pricey as long as you stay for a while. I would have gone on all of them but i unfortunately do not do well with lots of spinning \ud83d\ude05. The rides i did go on i enjoyed a lot though! If you go \u2026",
          "Super fun! A bit expensive being only 27(+) attractions. But super fun for a date day. Need about 4 for a full day",
          "Great rides, great park for indoors, awesome day for the family with varying rides to keep everyone happy for an afternoon. Although with the family attraction it attracts more kids making it busier and louder. Park could be a little more \u2026",
          "Just a walk through.  Lots of 40 yr old memories",

          "Love the mind bender but most rides are for younger kids",

I just don't find the price reflected the value appropriately for the day pass  we did have fun though",

          "The prices are pretty high and there's always rides that are shut down for maintenance. There was an hour left and we wanted to make a quick walk through and try some rides hoping for a special since there was only an hour left. We had to buy the. $35 wrist band or it'd come out to something like $15+ for each ride...",
          "Great place to have fun with the family with kids older than 3 y/o",
          "We had so much fun, kids loved it. Very big indoor amusement park. But except few rides for all rides kids must be 4 feet taller to go on... That was frustrating since my two kids were inches away and couldn't get on the rides they wanted to be on.",
          "It was shocking at first but got better so on",
          "Love it got scared but it was fun",

          "rides were amazing! some can be scary though!!",
          "Great Indoor Amusement Park!  Perfect for kids.  First ride I recommend is the train as travels around the entire park and gives you an idea of the layout.  \n\nKids Play Park was the best I've been too.  Perfect for a 5yo.  The endless mazes \u2026",
          "Great place to take your kids to have fun. Friendly staff",
          "Disappointing. The place is way to cramp as the place appears to stuff way to many rides in the location. It might also be the fact to many rides are there that it feels like they run way to fast which made it not enjoyable.",

          "Price alone should open your eye's.   It's not Disneyland for flipsake, after 3+ decades even a major overhaul can only make an already boring \"kiddie\" park more expensive.",
          "It's really hard to judge a place like this, when you get to visit Wonderland almost weekly. In contrast to what else is available in the area this place is top notch.",

          "It's ok if your younger then 18 but other then maybe 4 rides it's not worth it for someone my age with no kids. But none the less was fun to walk around and remember when it was actually pretty fun all those years ago. Wish they made more effort in cleaning and maintaining the place.",

I loved the fact that there weren't many people when we first got there because it was a special event. The roller coasters and Ship were our favourite rides today! We will be back.",

          "I went with my boyfriend on a 50% off date and it was totally worth it. It was our first time, and my favorite was the huge rollercoaster and the thing that has different levels where you walk across various tiny bridges held together by ropes.",
          "Fun indoor amusement park. They have an alright selection of rides for all ages. Lots of rides for the area of space they have. It is a bit pricey though to ride. Last time we went they charged tickets for the adult to help hold the smaller \u2026",

          "Great variety of rides and with toddler time the prices are good.  However, I would say it is quite pricey if you are going with normal prices.  The rides are well done but I would also say the place is due for renovation.  It looks \u2026",
          "The kids had a great time on the rides. I had fun watching them. A little pricey but worth it for a splurge once in awhile.",
          "Amazing place for families and kids to visit.  There are numerous choices of fun rides and games and all are guaranteed to enjoy something. For those who dont want to take a ride, the walking around and looking at; or observing other's expiriencing thier moments of adrenaline will be a fun moment for you.",
          "Solid option for kids. The indoor play park is a great place for them to run around and burn off some energy.",
          "This place is pretty incredible. When my wife told me about this place being inside and in a mall I was worried it would be lame. Boy was I wrong. It had great stuff for the little kids and for the adapts and everyone in between. It\u2019s pricey but you get what you pay for.",

          "About $15/person to ride the Mindebender one time... If you want to ride it more than once it would be better to buy a day pass. Line up was short at the end of the day when we went.",

          "A good place to go scream",
          "Loved it. Quirks in the Works was a fun little ride hidden away and the bumper cars were the best bumper cars I've been on. My kids, 10 and 8, had plenty to do. I would try to avoid the Galactic Rodeo. The waiter is painful.",
          "Greatest indoor amusement park. Its really nice that even at winter you can go to an amusement park. Also the color scheme is very bright and fun.",
          "Terrible, we used points and every single ride we were not treated equal. We were last on and first off the balloon race which I feel was ridiculous. Where as folks with wristbands stayed on far longer. I wouldn't recommend it if your not \u2026",

          "There was a lot of rush when we went in after dark, and it was really dark, so the kids were scared and we couldnt see clearly, and long queues. I think the turn around time between rides can be improved significantly. Also the play area \u2026",

          "It's a fun place for kids",
          "FANTASTIC! Even fun for grown ups. You really get bang for you buck here during the week before school is out. Not sure how crazy it gets on weekends but we had a great time. Staff was all friendly. The mall(West Edmonton Mall) itself was \u2026",
          "A great indoor theme park experience. I'm a fan of most of the rides but the ones I'm not a fan of are just personal preference rather than actual fault in the ride. The facility is pretty old now though and while they do their best to keep it nice, you can't help but feel the age of the place. Although overall, it's a really fun time",
          "Kids loved it!! There was something for everyone! And the staff was great",
          "I can\u2019t visit Edmonton without enjoying this great facility with my wife and our four kids. It is one of the best indoor amusement parks I\u2019ve ever seen. Thanks to all of those who are adding value to our life. I enjoy playing the different roller coster games that this land has.",

          "Fun for friends visiting from out of town",
          "Love to enjoy  galaxy land rides",
          "I feel like if they take the main ride away for three weeks (swings) then they should be offering a discount to ride what they do have.  We came her specifically for that so kind of sucks.  And 50dollars a person is ridiculous",
          "Well maintained and clean.",
          "Swings are down, not sure if maintenance or not and they were selling this specialty cotton candy for SEVEN dollars and it wasnt even very much. Take the trek through the mall to the north of the pirate ship on the main level to the frozen yogurt place. They sell cotton candy that is HUGE! Only $3.50.",
          "Love this red rollercoaster !",
          "Was surprised to see more rides were added for teens & adults! I came with my 7 year old so there was less for him but I'm thrilled with the new ride additions, as someone who grew up with WEM and noticed there were many thrill rides removed, so I'm happy to see them return and can't wait to go on them myself!",
          "Always lots of fun. They keep getting better rides. We'll be back!",
          "Bring earplugs. So loud in here.",
          "Rides r gd but the price was expensive over 100 for two ppl",
          "Good assortment of rides...clean.. convenient. Pricey day, though. Not an inexpensive place to go.",
          "Rides for all ages. I might suggest queing lines a bit disorganized.  Definitely a must see!",
          "The kids loved it but expensive unless you stay for the whole day",
          "My husband and I went to Galaxyland on a Monday (low season). The prices were very reasonable in our opinion! The staff were super friendly and the rides were a blast! Can't wait to bring the kids back when they're a bit older. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Prices of 5$ a ride a bit high if you just want a few rides, but under 43inch get 40$ all day and an adult for 18$ more. Not bad",
          "A bit too expensive for us but a great place for some fun with kids when it is cold outside.",
          "Wonderful experience with my kids but super expensive for a family of four. We went on a Friday when school was in (took the kids out of school) and spent 5 hours there. There was basically no wait for any ride and we all had a riot! I would say make a full day of it and it's worth the money.",
          "This place is amazing for kids of all ages and adults as well. Lots of rides to enjoy making it a great fun place to be. It is a bit loud most of the time due to the rollercoaster rolling around above.",
          "Today was my first time walking around the amusement park in West Edmonton Mall. They have so many options of rides. I was impressed with the roller coaster; the drop is pretty good for being indoors. \nAlso very impressed with the entertainment options in general: video games, basketball and many",
          "First time here. Shocked at the cost of it and it was quite crowded and the speed of getting people on and off rides was less than desired but overall was a cool place. If i go back it will be a weekday with more time because line ups take forever.",
          "Rides and attractions are definitely designed for kids and tiny people, wanted to walk climbing, girl who ran it is a total complete sweetheart, she was gonna wave 5 bucks for a climb, unfortunately I didnt fit in the harness , oh well , still like west ed",
          "Awesome place for kids and has many rides and attractions some are fun for grown ups too.",
          "This place is in desperate need of some updating much like all of WEM.  My 8 year old found most of the rides to bee too young for him.  There was only a couple he felt were fun. The place is quite over priced.  We went on a week day and \u2026",
          "Lots of fun for kids. Buy the bracelet, its cheaper in the long run.",

          "Hot, long lines but fun attractions!",
          "\ud83d\udd95These kids running the rides are trained to just run the rides even if there's only one person on the ride.. Once they lock the gate and people come into the line for the ride, the people have to wait for the next ride.  Just open the gate and load the people up... Fill up the ride",
          "Got in early, great and clean.  Well staffed.\nLines moved.  \nWas a terrific time!  Bathroom were even clean.",
          "Possibly quite fun for a full day visit especially during the winter months, but an absolute waste of time and money for a short visit. Unless you are buying a full day pass, the prices of the rides are ridiculously expensive and not worth even to consider...",

Only complaint I have is the expansion of the arcade- people can go to any old arcade to play video games, people come to Galaxyland for the rides.

        "wiki": "William Hawrelak Park (or simply Hawrelak Park) is a park in Edmonton, Alberta. Formerly known as Mayfair Park, it was initially going to be developed into a 500-lot subdivision; however, when the Strathcona Land Syndicate forfeited their taxes the city obtained the title for the land in 1922. This land lay unused until 1954, when Mayor William Hawrelak proposed to create a 350-acre (1.4 km2) riverside park in this area as it would \u201cfit into the overall park development of the City along the lines of the zoo, and the golf courses and other picnic areas\u201d. The digging of the man-made lakes began in 1959 and later was completed in 1964 but had few facilities. The official opening day of Mayfair Park was on Dominion Day, July 1, 1967. It was renamed in 1982 for Hawrelak, who died in office in 1975 while serving as mayor of Edmonton.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\n\nThe park is situated in Edmonton's river valley, next to the North Saskatchewan River. Rented paddleboats are used on the artificial lake during summer. The lake is not used for public swimming, but it has been used for the swimming portion of events when Edmonton hosted the 2001 ITU World Triathlon Championship, and since 2014 as a stop on the annual ITU World Triathlon Series. In the winter, the lake is used as a public skating rink.\nAs with all City of Edmonton Parks, the park is open to the public 5 am\u201311 pm, 365 days a year. The park has walking\u2013hiking trails around the perimeter which can be used for cross-country skiing in the winter. There are picnic sites, a playground, and beach volleyball nets on site. Many of the picnic sites feature fire pits.In 1983, the park was the track cycling venue for the 1983 Summer Universiade.\nFrom 1998 until 2008, the park hosted the Bright Nights Festival around Christmas. Since 1990 the Silver Skate Festival has hosted the Annual Winter Festival of Arts, Culture Recreation and Sport.  In 2016 the festival partnered with Ice Castles of America to bring the first ice castle in Canada, and it has called Hawrelak Park home every winter since.\n\n\n== Heritage Amphitheatre ==\n\nThe Heritage Amphitheatre  is western Canada's largest outdoor amphitheatre, which completed construction in 1985. It has seating for 1,133 people and up to 2,900 people with the surrounding grass area. Each year approximately 50,000 people visit it to enjoy musical, dramatic, and other performances in Edmonton's pleasant summer months. The amphitheatre is host to many of Edmonton's festivals, including the Freewill Shakespeare Festival, Rockfest, Edmonton's Labatt Blues Festival, the Symphony Under the Sky Festival (run by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra), the Edmonton Heritage Festival (the event that gave the Heritage Amphitheatre its name), and the Interstellar Rodeo Festival. Although the amphitheatre is within Hawrelak Park, it is run by the City of Edmonton Civic Events Office, and not the Parks Department.\nA wind storm in 2013 ripped the canopy, forcing the replacement of the canopy in 2014, and making events like the Freewill Shakespeare Festival move venues temporarily.The inside area under the stage contains a green room, two dressing rooms, washrooms, and an office, all for staff and performers. Indoor heated and fully serviced washrooms are available at the back of house for the spectators and areas are set up for vendors to occupy for food and other services. Picnic tables are often set up for grass seating patrons who do not sit in the 1,133 fixed seats, or they may bring seats of their own. Parking has always been a concern for events at the amphitheatre, as there is often more spectators attending the events in the amphitheatre than Hawrelak Park has parking stalls; some parking stalls are also often reserved for staff, performers, and vendors of the event itself. Park and ride is often available for events, supplied in part by the Edmonton Transit System. The buses come straight to Hawrelak Park from the University of Alberta.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdmontonPlus.ca\nHeritage Amphitheatre\nPhotos",

        "wiki": "The Illinois Railway Museum (IRM, reporting mark IRMX) is the largest railroad museum in the United States. It is located at 7000 Olson Road in Union, Illinois, 55 miles (89 km) northwest of Chicago.\nGranted tax-exempt status in 1957, the museum aims to demonstrate the vital role railroads have played in the growth of the Chicago area and the United States as a whole. There are over 450 pieces of prototype equipment in its collection as well as numerous displays. Visitors may ride on some of the museum's electric, steam, and diesel-powered trains from April through October.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe museum was founded in 1953 by ten people who joined together to purchase Indiana Railroad interurban car 65. Originally called the Illinois Electric Railway Museum, the museum was renamed in 1961 to reflect its expanding scope. Initially located on the grounds of the Chicago Hardware Foundry in North Chicago, Illinois, the museum's entire collection was moved in 1964 to Union along the former right-of-way of the Elgin and Belvidere Electric Company. Two years later, operations began using Illinois Terminal Railroad interurban car 415; in 1967, the first steam locomotive was operated. The first storage barn was erected in 1971. In 1981, a one-mile (1.6 km) streetcar loop was constructed. A 4.6-mile (7.4 km) railroad line was built during the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\nThe museum's operations are primarily concentrated around its main campus just east of Union. Train rides are offered on the main line as well as the streetcar loop. Electric trains are operated from April through October, and diesel and steam trains from the beginning of May through the end of September. Trolleybus operation occurs on the Saturdays of the Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day weekends, as well as on \"Bus Day\"; the last Saturday in September or the first Saturday in October. IRM is one of only two railway museums in the country that operates both electric and diesel trains, and the only one to offer trolleybus rides on a regular basis.\n\n\n== Equipment and structures ==\n\n\n=== Physical plant ===\n\nThe Illinois Railway Museum property covers more than 80 acres (32 ha), the most extensive physical plant of any rail museum in North America. In 2009, the museum bought another 89 acres (36 ha) of adjacent land as a buffer against development. The main campus is located at 42\u00b013\u203240.0\u2033N 88\u00b031\u203238.08\u2033W. In addition to the museum's revenue trackage, the main campus in Union includes: \n\n11 equipment storage barns with a total of about 3 miles (4.8 km) of track under cover\nTwo additional garages housing trolleybuses and motor buses\nA dedicated steam restoration shop\nA former Chicago and North Western railway depot from Marengo, Illinois, built in 1851\nA complete Chicago Rapid Transit Company ground-level station (50th Avenue station, closed by CTA in 1978)\nFour streetcar stations of varying design\nSeveral restored and functional neon signs and concrete entablatures on display\nAn indoor dining facility built in 2003 (open seasonally)\nA 130-foot turntable from the Union Pacific Railroad's Burnham ShopsIRM also owns two off-site libraries; the Pullman Library in downtown Union and the Strahorn Research Library in downtown Marengo.\n\n\n=== Notable equipment ===\nAmong the locomotives preserved at IRM are:\n\nAmtrak 945: EMD AEM-7\nAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe 2903: 4-8-4 \"Northern\" type steam locomotive\nChicago, Burlington and Quincy 114: Only GE U28B in preservation, and the only one in its original shape\nChicago, Burlington, and Quincy 504: One of two EMD SD24s in preservation\nChicago, Burlington, and Quincy 9911A \"Silver Pilot\": The only surviving EMD E5\nChicago and North Western 1518: First EMD GP7 ever built\nChicago and North Western 411: EMD F7\nChicago and North Western 6847: EMD SD40-2 restored from Union Pacific\nChicago South Shore and South Bend 803: 2-D+D-2 \"Little Joe\", the only operational \"800 Class\", only run during special occasions\nConrail 4601: GE E33\nGrand Trunk Western 6323: Class U-3 4-8-4 \"Northern\" type locomotive, the last GTW steam locomotive to run on GTW rails\nIllinois Central 201: On static display, participated in the \"Wheels A-Rolling\" pageant at the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1949\nIllinois Central 3719: The railroad's only surviving 2-6-0\nJ.

Museum management includes a board of directors, elected by the regular membership of about 160 active volunteers. A board president is elected by the directors. The board oversees the general manager, a volunteer who in turn has oversight over an array of department heads. Major departments include Steam, Diesel, Electric Car, Passenger Car, Freight Car, Track & Signal, Buildings & Grounds, Trolley Bus, Motor Bus, and Operations. Other departments oversee the museum's libraries, electrical infrastructure, and display and education functions. Most department heads are volunteers. All workers at the museum fall under the direct authority of one of the department heads. The vast majority of workers are volunteers. Anyone who is interested in trains or other collections/aspects of the museum is actively encouraged to volunteer, with required training done by the museum.\n\n\n== Use in film ==\nIRM has been used in several films, due to its proximity to Chicago and its extensive collection of historic railroad equipment. In the 1992 film A League of Their Own, starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna, the museum's depot was used for several small-town depot scenes; other scenes featured with the Nebraska Zephyr and only surviving EMD E5. The 1993 movie Groundhog Day featured the museum's EMD SD24 diesel locomotive. The museum's grounds and some of the passenger cars were used in the movie The Babe, starring John Goodman. In late 2005, the Burlington 9911A and several coaches operated to Chicago for filming in Flags of Our Fathers, a Clint Eastwood film. The initial sequence of 2008's The Express: The Ernie Davis Story was shot at IRM. The most recent film Transformers: Age of Extinction starring Mark Wahlberg, released in 2014, made IRM the host of several scenes.Many television shows' railroad sequences have been shot at the IRM. Scenes depicting steam era operations in the late 1920s were shot for the 1993 television series The Untouchables. The hit show Chicago Fire features the IRM onsite in the season 2 episode \"No Regrets\".\n\n\n== Special events ==\nThe museum hosts a series of annual special events:\n\nDay out with Thomas event in July\nBunny Trolley Hop around Easter\nChicago Day in June, which commemorates the end of streetcar service in Chicago in 1958\nScout Day in May\nVintage Transportation Extravaganza one of the largest antique car shows in the state on the first Sunday in August\nDiesel Days in mid-August\nMuseum Showcase Weekend in mid-September\n\"Bus Day\" the last Saturday of September\n\"Happy Holiday Railway\" (weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of United States railroads\nList of Illinois railroads\nList of heritage railroads in the United States\nList of railway museums\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The neon sign museum is a really fun and unique place to visit. There are plaques on the wall about every sign, telling you it's history and if you come at night, they will be all lit up! Don't forget to check the other side of the road for additional signs, and come back often to see the new additions!",
          "Pretty at night. Fairly quiet street, not a whole lot going on. Really feels like a museum rather than a street that looks cool. Still worth a stroll through if you're in the area.",
          "My favorite street in Edmonton.",
          "Such a great idea and is situated on the most beaitiful street from downtown of Edmonton!! it is free it is displyed on a building, outside, and it is very spectacular even at daytime.",
          "Wish all the signs were lit up though :(\n\ninsta: @samantha.pye",
          "A wonderful collection of old neon, colorful nostalgia.",
          "Good place if you'd like to check out some vintage signage, however it's not an actual museum.",
          "Its nice to see in the Night.",
          "Awesome to visit at night !!!",
          "Such a cute little piece of our history",
          "Really cool concept. It would be nice if the city expanded on the idea and had a neon sign museum like the one in Las Vegas.",
          "It's really just a lot of neon signs on the sides of some buildings. They look really great a dusk!",
          "Cool street!  Neat spot.",
          "A great idea and way to preserve a piece of history. Obviously, it is best seen at night!",
          "Great place to see some old signs from the past to bad all the lights on signs were not working",
          "Nice little collection, cool area to walk around.",
          "Cool collection of neon signs",
          "Its outdoors. \nNeat to look at and there are plaques on the wall that you can read and they give a short history of where the signs were from and what each place was about.\nDon't pay for parking as it only takes about 15 to 20 minutes to read all the plaques and look at all the signs which are all hanging on the Telus building.",
          "Love this. Beautiful old neon saved and brightening up the cold, white North.",
          "Bulbs to be replaced",
          "This is an amazing little piece of Edmonton, right in the heart of it!\n\nIt only takes about 10 to 15 minutes go get through and is on either side of about a hald block, and is outdoors (so dress appropriately).\n\nEach neon sign has a little \u2026",
          "Such a cool thing to see. Very nestelgic",
          "A must see if you are visiting Vegas. You get a snippet of a history lesson and the guides are enthusiastic. ",
          "Some of my photos are on display there",
          "So enjoy the neon signs history.",
          "Fantastic addition to Downtown. Simple placemaking like this that makes for great streets. Keep it up!",
          "Worth the drive or walk to see. So unique and we are lucky to have this in Edmonton! Very creative people running this!",
          "Many old signs from businesses around Edmonton. Outside on the side of a building so it is always open for viewing ",
          "Great at night.",
          "Fun ideas, great visual addition to Edmonton scene",
          "I work nearby these signs look amazing",
          "Pretty cool place to walk by at night :)",
          "This is one of those rare peices of public art that is wholesomely enjoyable and entierly tasteful. Every time I drive through downtown at night I try to come by here just to give whoever is in my car a look at this fun part of edmonton's downtown.",
          "Need to add signs.",
          "One of Edmonton's street parties",
          "Outdoor museum, what you see is what you get.",
          "So cool. Check it out.",
          "Worth walking by when exploring Edmonton downtown",
          "Just a few neon signs outside the building. Don't expect anything special.",
          "Awesome variety of neon signs",
          "Great to walk by at night.",
          "I love that there's a spot for these signs as they're a part of Edmonton's history, but I feel like it's overhyped.",

        "wiki": "HMCS Edmonton is a Kingston-class coastal defence vessel that has served in the Canadian Forces since 1997. Edmonton is the fourth ship of its class, all of which were built for the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project. The ship is the first vessel to use the designation HMCS Edmonton. The ship is assigned to Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) and is homeported at CFB Esquimalt.\n\n\n== Design and description ==\nThe Kingston class was designed to fill the minesweeper, coastal patrol and reserve training needs of the Canadian Forces, replacing the Bay-class minesweepers, Porte-class gate vessels and Royal Canadian Mounted Police coastal launches in those roles. In order to perform these varied duties the Kingston-class vessels are designed to carry up to three 6.1-metre (20 ft) ISO containers with power hookups on the open deck aft in order to embark mission-specific payloads. The seven module types available for embarkation include four route survey, two mechanical minesweeping and one bottom inspection modules.The Kingston class displace 970 long tons (990 t) and are 55.3 metres (181 ft 5 in) long overall with a beam 11.3 metres (37 ft 1 in) and a draught of 3.4 metres (11 ft 2 in). The coastal defence vessels are powered by four Jeumont ANR-53-50 alternators coupled to four W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 UD 23V12 diesel engines creating 7.2 megawatts (9,700 hp). Two LIPS Z-drive azimuth thrusters are driven by two Jeumont CI 560L motors creating 3,000 horsepower (2,200 kW) and the Z drives can be rotated 360\u00b0. This gives the ships a maximum speed of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) and a range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km; 5,800 mi) at 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph).The Kingston class is equipped with two Sperry Marine Bridgemaster \"E\" navigational radars, one using the I band and the other operating in the E and F bands. In 2017 Edmonton will be fitted with the Sperry Marine navigation suite, including updated NAVIGAT X gyrocompasses and NAVITWIN IV heading management system and repeaters. The vessels are equipped to carry an AN/SQS-511 towed side scan sonar for minesweeping and a Remote-control Mine Hunting System (RMHS). The vessels were equipped with one Bofors 40 mm/60 calibre Mk 5C gun and two M2 machine guns. The 40 mm gun was declared obsolete and removed from the vessels in 2014. Some of them ended up as museum pieces and on display at naval reserve installations across Canada. The Kingston-class coastal defence vessels have a regular complement of 33, with bunks available (using the accommodations payload) for up to 47.\n\n\n== Service history ==\nEdmonton was laid down on 8 August 1995 by Halifax Shipyards Ltd. at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was launched on 31 October 1996. The ship underwent sea trials on the east coast before transferring to the west coast, accompanied by Moresby. The vessel was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 21 June 1997 at Esquimalt, British Columbia and carries the hull number MM 703.In June\u2013July 2002, Edmonton and sister ships Nanaimo and Saskatoon participated in the naval exercise RIMPAC 2002 off Hawaii.In September 2013, Edmonton and sister ship Yellowknife sailed from Esquimalt for Operation Caribbe, the first such deployment of west coast Kingston class. On 25 October, Edmonton and her embarked United States Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) intercepted a panga-style vessel and seized 639 kilograms (1,409 lb) of cocaine. Two days later, Edmonton and her LEDET intercepted a second vessel and recovered 468 kg (1,032 lb) of cocaine that had been jettisoned during the chase. After the 40 mm gun was declared obsolete in 2014 and removed from Edmonton, Edmonton's mount was donated to the Edmonton Garrison Memorial Golf and Curling Club in April 2018.In February 2016 Edmonton and Saskatoon sailed from Esquimalt to join Operation Caribbe. On 25 March, in conjunction with the United States Navy destroyer Lassen, Edmonton intercepted drug smugglers in international waters off the coast of Central America. After being stopped the smuggling vessel attempted to dump its cargo overboard. Edmonton, working with a LEDET detachment, recovered 27 bales of cocaine equalling 650 kg (1,430 lb). Edmonton and Saskatoon returned to Esquimalt on 29 April 2016. On 6 October, Brandon and Edmonton left Esquimalt to participate in Operation Caribbe along the Pacific coast. Between 15 and 18 November, Edmonton disrupted three separate shipments of illegal narcotics. On 15 November, Edmonton recovered 40 kg (88 lb) from the ocean after a fishing vessel was intercepted by the United States Coast Guard. On 17 November, a second fishing vessel was stopped by the United States Coast Guard and Edmonton recovered 16 bales of cocaine weighing roughly 760 kg (1,680 lb) from the ocean. On 18 November, Edmonton took 15 bales of cocaine weighing roughly 710 kg (1,570 lb) from the ocean after the drug smugglers escaped. Brandon and Edmonton returned to Esquimalt on 16 December.From August to September 2017, Edmonton and Yellowknife sailed to the Arctic Ocean to perform surveillance of Canada's northern waters as part of Operation Limpid. They returned to Esquimalt on 5 October. In 2018, Edmonton deployed south into the eastern Pacific Ocean as part of Operation Caribbe alongside sister ship Whitehorse. The two ships participated in the intercept and seizure of 2,856 kg (6,296 lb) of illegal drugs. Edmonton and Whitehorse returned to Esquimalt on 3 May. The vessel returned to the eastern Pacific Ocean in November with sister ship Nanaimo, where Edmonton took part in the seizure of 750 kg (1,650 lb) of cocaine. The smugglers escaped and during the seizure, the ship suffered a loss of propulsion. The ship returned to Esquimalt on 17 December.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nMacpherson, Ken; Barrie, Ron (2002).

          "Doesn\u2019t hold a candle to other aquariums and zoos in other cities...but it\u2019s in the dang mall! Go for it. $15 for the Sea Lion show. The animals appear happy and well cared for. The price gets you access to the small aquarium as well where you can pet some sharks! It was a",
          "Tiny sea lion tank as compared to their natural environment. Not only this, but their small enclosure is surrounded by a massive pool that isn't in use adding to how depressed you already feel watching them live a life of cramped hell. Same exact thing with the penguins and",
          "It's so pathetic.My rooms in my house bigger than this aquarium. There's absolutely nothing to see. Except shark's and a big turtle.Some penguins and that's all.And all in one room. For money you paying, get at least more fish tanks,more reptiles, more everything. Everything in",
          "The only people saying this is good must be mall employees. More animals at pet store, and I've seen better aquarium in homes. Cost me around $36 for 1 adult and 2 kids and they were bored. Go to Petsmart or PJ's Pets and get a better experience for free.",
          "Please do not support the Captive Sea Lion Display. Read the history of how this started and animals that died being transported over. It seems that as long as its fun for the kids then its OK. These creatures are not here for our entertainment. Its so upsetting that they spend",
          "The aquarium has penguins, green sea turtles, sharks, snakes and a few other marine animals. It was interesting. The penguins are cute. There is a sea lion show a few times a day that is included. You can see that from up above on the bridge as well but I doubt you can hear",
          "Took my niece here on her 6th birthday and she had a blast. The show is really well done and discusses conservation too. Nice mix with the underwater caverns if you have a kid who's really into animals. Otherwise might not be totally worth it.",
          "Grandkids (9 and 11) participated in the sea lion encounter which they very much enjoyed. Family can view easily from the outside. Staff were great!",
          "This was included in our passes at WEM. When we went below ground to check out the marine life we were very pleasantly surprised by what we found. We all enjoyed it very much. Would definately recommend it.",
          "It was great to see families together having pictures taken with the sea lions. They are trained to swim up and look like they are kissing the patrons for the photos. It does sadden me to see any wild animal in captivity - just my opinion - however I'm sure they are well cared",
          "Enjoyed our visit to the sea lion show and the turtles. All of the animals look very well looked after and the sea lions seemed to be very happy. Great value for money as we purchased a package included with our stay at Fantasyland hotel which saves us money in the long run.",
          "Located in the West Edmonton Mall, this aquarium's underwater viewing area is tiny. I was forced to pay extra for the sea lion show which was about two hours later and I was not interested in staying around that long for it. If you expect an aquarium, do not waste your time. If",
          "I know I'm an adult and I have seen it many times but I still enjoy it like it was the first time. Thumbs up to the staff for actually caring for the animals. They seemed to have a great connection. Wish I had taken a picture but I was too entertained.",
          "I see the mixed reviews and I agree the aquarium downstairs is tiny and underwhelming but this is in a mall and I was just looking for something with less commitment time than the big activities and this fit the bill. We loved the Sea Lion Show! I wouldn't bring adults or older",
          "I did trainer for the today feb 9, 2017, it far exceeded my expectations. The amount of time, love, care that goes into taking care of all these creatures is incredible. All the employees love the animals so much. I seriously can not believe how well taken care of they are.",
          "The exhibit downstairs is very small! Some fish, sharks, turtles, reptiles and penguins. There is two tanks where you can touch the sharks and sea urchins/starfish. The penguin talk is short and informative. The sea lion show was actually quite entertaining and good but you",
          "The animals seem happy here and the trainers do their best to make it fun to watch and play with them. With a fairly regular schedule it is a great attraction to catch during your visit to the mall.",
          "The seal show was okay but the aquarium below was a major disappointment . There are many things timid at the mall. My suggestion would be to go to another venue.",
          "Sea Lions and Penguins in the middle of the mall. Kaitlyn has the best job ever! Would have cost us $50 Pros: Such a cool experience. Cons: Expensive. Found down stairs a little boring and the penguins look like 'Happy Feet' when Mumble gets caotured, sad. To short.",
          "Had a great time! My daughter had a photo with a sea lion that kissed her head! Loved every minute of it xx staff were lovely and so enthusiastic!!",
          "The price is affordable but the exhibit is tiny!! Don't expect to be entertained for long, we looked at the aquarium for 20 minutes and the sea lion show was about 20 minutes. The educational aspect was fine but I thought they could of expanded more on the information that was",
          "The sea lion show was okay, I guess, but not worth the price of admission. Marine Life was small. I usually like the sights at WEM, but not this.",
          "This was such a wonderful amazing experience! Really cheap admission, plus you get to go down stairs into a cavern styled room where they have touch tanks with aquatic animals and plants you can touch. They have a viewing tank with lots of fish and some sharks. In another tank",
          "All mall is amazing building. There\u00b4s so many activities for all families, but I don\u00b4t understand, why people likes watching sea lions in a small pool doing tricks, This animals belongs to the free nature, not to the small pool in shopping mall! People - we live in 21st century,",
          "This is our second time visiting Marine Life. We really enjoy the experience to be able to go downstairs to the underground aquarium with hands on stations. Years ago we touched the sting rays but this time it was closed. Instead they had spotted bamboo sharks you could touch,",
          "Got a family pass for thirty dollars and went downstairs only to find that the aquarium is a single room the size of a small garage with one viewing pool to the fish one house sized aquarium a couple of lizards and a small window to a couple of penguins. Trip finished in about 3",
          "well, I am not usually negative but the sea life show was somewhat sad and pathetic. I was surprised by the lack of professionalism. it was evident the show itself was just a photo op... and i couldn't believe the amount of people who were buying pictures! the caverns were",
          "Definitely a mixed review of this attraction. The one side with the rays, penguins and shark tank looked good. But the reptiles? Oh boy. They did a presentation with their green iguana \"dude\" explaining that he was a rescue and his previous issues. The presenter did a good job",
          "The sea lion show was great. Really informative. We enjoyed going down and petting the sharks. It was definitely well worth the money.",
          "Not a whole lot to see though it is a hands on experience if you want to touch some of the tidal pool marine life. Some neat exhibits, especially the penguins. If you watch the seal or shark show it's worth it, just don't plan on spending an afternoon...",
          "We visited in May of 2015. The price was very reasonable and it included a tour of the aquarium, penguin exhibit, and the Sea Lion show. The Sea Lions appeared very fat and happy. You could tell that the staff members love their jobs.",

          "We enjoyed the sea lion show and learned not to call it a seal! The sales pitch to book a sea lion expedition and the push to buy a souvenir photo was a bit too much and took away from the overall show. We did give in to the souvenir photo ($8) and I think it is in colour? (but",
          "A lot of fun to watch the sea lions play. I loved the noise that Pablo made on the microphone; while other politically polite people didn't. That made me laugh even more. Some people think so much in life is rude. It was a fun show and what can you do for $7.00. Fun place to",
          "Aquarium is small and not worth the money but the sea lions are awesome! You can watch for free standing on a higher level or the boat or if you want a picture with the sea lions go for the show. Cheapest fun entertainment of WEM I think!",
          "Just came back from 5 days at West Edmonton Mall with family, including my kids, 5 & 3. The Sea Life Caverns are a small aquarium at the West Edmonton Mall. The staff were very informative and actively engaging everyone. There were penguins, reptiles, and a large tank with"

It only takes about 30 minutes to walk through underground location. So it's not very long. Seal show was about 40 min and was great.",

          "Educational and fun to do with the kids, especially the sea lion show.",
          "Great to see the animals but feels like they haven't decided if they want to keep the place running or just close it down. Needs a big update.",
          "Lots of life to distract you from the outside world. Take your time to see everything twice. Not a large area, but you will live it if you take your time to explore.",
          "Lovely place. The sea lion show ist just about the right length for children, the aquarium is also great. What I do not understand is that there is only one person on the till for two queues after the show finishes. Why not short two people \u2026",
          "It is an amazing place. Both for adults and kids. Besides, children can learn at the same time that they have fun.",

          "It was way over priced for the tiny Aquarium. Took maybe 5 minutes to see everything and we took our time. There was a touch tank but my kids were not really interested. The larger tank with the different fish and sharks were also underwhelming. Not worth the admission price",

          "Loved the show, the animals look happy and cared for. The aquarium was small and good to see once.",
          "It's pretty small and they don't have too many sea creatures but it is still a nice place to take the kids or take a break from shopping.",
          "Great educational show, great staff and animals look very happy compared to others i have seen where is all about making a profit. These people really care about their animals.",
          "Really interesting going shoping and being able to see a seal show.",
          "I would  have liked  more information about the animals than about recycling",
          "Good show, they just don't give accurate photo prices till you go to pick your picture",
          "Beautiful to look at and the show with the marine life is a must c, funny and entertaining.",
          "Went for a school program and the tour guides and the program were excellent! Students were completely engaged and enjoyed learning about marine life.",
          "Awesome!! West Edmonton Mall sea lion  show.",
          "Probably not worth $10 but it still is a nice little stop if you have 3 minutes to spare. The staff are very nice and helpful. Maybe a $6 stop but I'd still recommend it to at least visit once.",
          "My son loves the show. Would be great if it was longer.",
          "My son loved his penguin experience.",
          "It's not accessible for those unable to do stairs in a wheelchair really. There is a small seating area at the entrance for those needing accessible seating.",
          "Marine life is very small and quick for the amount of admission you have to pay.",
          "Only worth it if you go check out the aquarium and sea lion show. Nice underground aquarium.",
          "Fun show! Loved seeing the penguin and seals. We also were lucky enough to witness a snake feeding.",
          "I loved the sea lion show and it was amazing to go down stairs and see the sharks and other fish. I been to WEM lots and I did not know what was down stairs, I wish I would have known about it because I would have went a long time ago.",
          "Fun to take the kids to, not a lot to do though.",
          "Nice place, need to have more activities",
          "Good place to spend time with kids",
          "I enjoyed myself. I don't think children should be encouraged to touch the fish or marine life though. It was horrifying for me watching little kids slap around at these strange fish and try and grab them which really made me question this places ethics.",
          "The most special place on the planet. I love the sea lions and penguins.",
          "Great! There's penguins and you get to touch some sea creatures!",
          "Love all the animals but they shouldnt be in a mall.",
          "Amazing must see show and great one to get the kids involved from petting sharks to having a seal lion kiss your head.",
          "Great experience",
          "Good if standing on the side. Not worth paying to sit inside.",
          "I like marine life! They had marine life! 10/10",
          "We had a lovely experience here! The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, they answered all of our questions and even permitted my blind daughter to participate in the touch portion of the reptile photos even though we had gotten a photo \u2026",
          "We wanted to go to the zoo but because it was raining, we decided to spend the day at WEM. We went to Marine Life with no expectations at all but it ended up being a lot of fun! We got to pet anemones and sharks, watch a penguin show and a sea lion show! We didn't expect much since it was in a mall but we were truly impressed!!",
          "Pretty darn cool",
          "Awesome place",
          "Good little attraction to take the kids too.",
          "One of the best attractions in WEM",
          "Pretty cool for a small professional aquarium. Lots to check out and see.",
          "Great show",
          "Great place, great show!",
          "Staff was very knowledgeable and very clean and well kept facility.  However, disappointed in the cost, also we waited for my daughters to each get their picture with the sea lion and after waiting a good 30 minutes for out turn they \u2026",
          "So much fun with my little here. We could stay all day and watch the penguins play and the turtle swim.",
          "Overall very nice, it's too bad that they lack space to expand certain areas. The penguin enclosure is bigger than it looks from the outside. Animals all look pretty relaxed and well cared for too. It's a nice place to go relax for a little while.",
          "We did the seal encounter and it was a very neat experience as a family. Very expensive, but so are all the other activities at west ed...lol free access to tour the exhibit after, kids really enjoyed the touch tank and all the fish. They \u2026",
          "I would say only worth the $14 if you catch the sea lions show and shark feeding as well. Beware that at the sea lions show, you have to pay $10 for a picture with a sea lion or other animal and they watermark the bottom of the picture...",
          "While it is terrible to have such wild animals trapped inside a mall, I do enjoy taking my children to learn",
          "Great learning opportunities and great to be able to see this creatures up close",
          "It is very small but good experience specially during the winter with not many options to do. It is good to have this kind of indoor places kids like it!! I recommended to go.",
          "Interesting",
          "Great value and great fun! Petting a shark was the highlight of the kids day.",
          "I visited marine life and loved the sea lion it was amazing and funny I enjoyed it so much",
          "Really great show.",
          "Not bad there no much stuff but there active and keep swammimg",
          "Always enjoy seeing the show",
          "Amazing place, sea lions rock was awesome.",
          "Informative employees that work there and good value for your money.",
          "It was a fun experience, but probably not worth the price. It's only a couple of rooms with not very much to look at overall. Don't expect to be there for over an hour. However, it was enjoyable to see all the critters. The penguins were super friendly, and they all have identifiers so you can see what their names are.",
          "We visited with our Interactions class from Allendale Junior High...they were very patient with our students.",
          "Took my kids to their first sealion show at sea life caverns and it delivered. The kids had a blast and even got to be a part of the show!",
          "Great atmosphere, great place to visit, very educational, a little small but high quality displays.",
          "So fun for all ages and reasonable price",
          "Great place for kids good value for the money",
          "Lots of fun! Watched the seal lion show which was well done. Good value at $14 a person. Highly recommend.",
          "Cool but it needs more, we were in and out in 5 minutes",
          "Knowledgeable staff but the aquarium area is just too small for the price.",
          "Love this everytime",
          "Wonderful views.",
          "A must if you have children. Fantastic place with lots of fun creatures to see!",
          "West Edmonton mall. Need I say more.",
          "This is a nice little aquarium for some interesting fish and penguins. However it is much smaller than anticipated, it takes approximately 15-30min at most to finish touring the entire exhibition. I wish there were more fish in the tanks and a longer exhibition.",
          "The place is so tiny. I feel awful for the marine life there. The penguins are crammed in a tiny space and the shark/turtle/fish tank is also so small. They just circle and circle. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I respect the life that is being used for our viewing pleasure.",
          "Awesome place \nmust visit",
          "An Amazing world",
          "Kinda small.",
          "The mall offers everything you need its keeps you going as of the size of the place lots of things to do skating, swimming arcades.",
          "Love bringing my daughter here!",
          "I have been spending time in West Edmonton mall since the very first day it opened to the public, literally.\nOne thing I've never done is go down to the Marine Life Aquarium! On this trip home with our 3 year old we decided to give it a go \u2026",
          "Wonderful caring humans treating the animals with \ud83d\udc93 and respect.",
          "The sea lion show was alright. I don't think it's changed in a while, but it's still super adorable. The Aquarium downstairs was alright. The penguin exhibit was being cleaned, so all the penguins were right by the glass. This seemed good \u2026",
          "The displays aren\u2019t worth the money. Not a lot of stuff to see. The sea lion shows are cool though. And the staff were friendly",
          "I did enjoy it, it is a first class exhibit. My only complain is it wasn't bigger. Definately worth a visit.",
          "Disappointingly small, but, there are giant sea turtles and you can pet sharks, anemones and urchins, so I guess that's cool",
          "I was enjoying it until I saw they misspelled Colombian boa constrictor. Is colOmbian not Columbian!!",
          "Expensive even though we got half price tickets for end of day discount. The staff Who Sold us tickets was literally the worst customer service I have ever had ever. The fish and animals looked bored and unhappy... Almost over growing their enclosures.",
          "Attraction at it's finest",
          "I miss this place! My kids were so happy to see the marine life",
          "only worth it if youve absolutely never seen anything like it, otherwise just go to the floor above it and look down",
          "Great for toddlers!",
          "My kids loved the area where you can touch the animals.  The only drawback is it is very hot and humid with no airflow.",
          "Very cool. Informative.",
          "Interesting distraction within this gigantic mall. Animals look like they are treated well and staff was very nice. Kids seem to really enjoy their visits.",
          "Fun, not very big.",
          "Interpreter on shift was great!",
          "I enjoy looking at the animals and wildlife here and the Penguins are cute as hell!",
          "Very small. Touch tanks are cool, they have a penguin habitat and a wall aquarium. Spent about 15-20 minutes there with a toddler.",
          "Poor animals. Makes me sad that they have to live like this for human entertainment.",
          "Not much life in the matine environment.",
          "Very interesting exhibit with lots to see and do.",
          "That so amazing that was my first but went",
          "Very small with few exhibits. You can be through in a matter of minutes.",
          "Sea lion show is worth watching. Kids love it.",
          "Tiny. Don't waste your money. Go to the zoo instead.",
          "Very interesting site at the mall! A giant ship!",
          "Was a really cool experience",
          "Marine life was amazing, however the show was only 20 minutes and overpriced for that amount of time",
          "Absolutely amazing experience as Trainers for the Day!",
          "Great time! Went with my two year old son and he didn't want to leave. Loved seeing the sea lions!",
          "Love this place",
          "Definatly worth the price, check out the sea lion show !",
          "Pretty cool little place.  Check it out after 4 for a great deal but get there early if you want to experience the sea lion show!",
          "Better be ready to spend money while you're there",
          "The children always love the animals, especially after shopping for a day!",
          "Price is high for whats offered",
          "Fun with my 11 year old Grandaughter",
          "The Sea Lions were well trained, but other shows I've seen before with seals and dolphins doing flips and jumps are a lot more interesting.",
          "We bought tickets once.  Really inexpensive for the family.  But tickets does not guarantee you a seat.  So buy the line up.  The sea cavern is fairly small.  No more than 20 minutes to look at everything and read about the sea creatures.",
          "Way to expensive",
          "Pablo is a great attraction!",
          "Was a great experience and the staff were kind, friendly and informative",
          "Great experience!",
          "Friendly, informative, family friendly shows with lots of crowd involvement. Perfect for family's.",
          "Its cute for kids",
          "Very expensive for not much there. The animals look well cared for. The kids found it great but I was disappointed in the size of it all",
          "An interesting, but short, show with the sea lions.  The penguin's inclusion in the show amounts to talking about penguins while one stands on a barrel top.",
          "Fun place to explore sea life and you can even pet a shark.",
          "The animals seem happy here and the trainers make it fun to watch and play with them. People near the front may get wet. They do have a fairly regular schedule, making it a great stop during your visit to the mall.",
          "The aquarium is so small! It's a disappointment..\nAnd don't pay for the show please you can watch the entire show without paying.. Just stand around or upstairs and enjoy the whole show just like others who paid.. It's a waste of money place. I regretted after the visit.",
          "The sea life cavern is not worth it.. way too small",
          "Fam and I enjoyed the activities! Will definitely come back!",
          "Loved the reptile demonstration, the petting creatures and the different animals. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "Love it",
          "Nice place to go for kids and adults too.",
          "The Sea lions are a short and sweet educational experience. Keeps the young ones attention, but doesn't drag it on for parents to get frustrated with the wee ones trying to escape.",
          "Small but nice.",
          "Place looks well kept and the animals looked after, but it\u2019s sure expensive for the size. Not worth the trip in my opinion.",
          "Very small display of animals",
          "Cool for the littles, but pretty small and not worth the $$ imo",
          "They present interesting animals to the crowd and offer a variety of options of pictures with a sea lion.",
          "Had an amazing trip with my son and grandbaby",
          "I love the penguins!",
          "Awesome stuff",
          "Expected",
          "I love scuba diving. It's great to see the performance and for my kids to develop an interest in the oceans.",
          "Small but friendly and nice little handling pool",
          "Bought some nice fish",
          "Not what I was expecting for $15 , there is not much to look at in the cavern was disappointed.Also when asking questions while buying our tickets the staff member was not helpful at all.",
          "Awesome experience.",
          "We pet snakes and sharks",
          "Very expensive.",
          "Nice",
          "Great place",
          "Fun little place. Fairly cheap. Littles kids love it. Great staff.",
          "Pretty decent for a tiny little marine zoo",
          "Beatitiful",
          "kinda pricy very little to look at, I took my 5 year old and she was done in 5 minutes, your paying for the sealion show if you're there at the right time.",
          "Love sea lions",
          "It is quite simply paying to support animal abuse.",
          "Good for children",
          "Boring",
          "Good show.my daughter enjoyed",
          "PENGUINS AND SEA LIONS WERE SO CUTE!!!!",
          "Fun for the whole family",
          "Love it every time, though was disappointed by the reptile show when they only fed the turtles.",
          "Wholesome info-entertainment for the team!",
          "It was nice",
          "The under water caves aren't worth the money,  just watch the sea lions",
          "Good for kids",
          "Noice",
          "Not much to see. Disappointing.",
          "Amazing !@-@",
          "I was very disappointed on this size of the aquarium. There was not enough this to touch!!! 1 star",
          "Good for kids",
          "This place needs a refresh and/or expansion.",
          "Fun to see",
          "Not as fun as marine land",
          "Stunning",
          "\ud83d\udc21\ud83d\udc1a",
          "Pointy 5/5.",

          "Dandy fish for a dandy mall.",
          "Good fun for the kids",
          "It's okay. Not stunning, but different than you see in central Canada.",
          "Cool to see, but its expensive. Watch from the second floor for free.",
          "Extremely poor service!!!! Not impressed!!!!!!",
          "Fun for the kids. Interesting place to discover.\n\n",
          "Highly recommended!\n\n",
          "The penguins are the ultimate. Unfortunately the penguins on the wall program is very expensive, about $ 125 per person, plus $ 30 for the photos. I understand that the costs to keep penguins must be high. Still, it \u2026",

        "wiki": "Edmonton ( (listen)) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. The city anchors the north end of what Statistics Canada defines as the \"Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor\".The city had a population of 932,546 in 2016, making it Alberta's second-largest city and Canada's fifth-largest municipality. Edmonton's 2019 municipal census subsequently recorded a population of 972,223. Also in 2016, Edmonton had a metropolitan population of 1,321,426, making it the sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is North America's northernmost metropolitan area with a population over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian.Edmonton's historic growth has been facilitated through the absorption of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North Edmonton, West Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place) in addition to a series of annexations through 1982, and the annexation of 8,260 ha (82.6 km2) of land from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont on January 1, 2019. Known as the \"Gateway to the North\", the city is a staging point for large-scale oil sands projects occurring in northern Alberta and large-scale diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories.Edmonton is a cultural, governmental and educational centre. It hosts a year-round slate of festivals, reflected in the nickname \"Canada's Festival City\". It is home to North America's largest mall, West Edmonton Mall (the world's largest mall from 1981 until 2004), and Fort Edmonton Park, Canada's largest living history museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants arrived in the area that is now Edmonton around 3000 BC and perhaps as early as 12,000 BC when an ice-free corridor opened as the last glacial period ended and timber, water, and wildlife became available in the region.\n\nIn 1754, Anthony Henday, an explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area. His expeditions across the Canadian Prairies were mainly to seek contact with the Indigenous population for establishing the fur trade, as the competition was fierce between the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. \nBy 1795, Fort Edmonton was established on the river's north bank as a major trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company, near the mouth of the Sturgeon River close to present-day Fort Saskatchewan. Fort Edmonton, also known as Edmonton House, was built within \"musket-shot range\" of the rival North West Company's (NWC) Fort Augustus. The fort's name was chosen by William Tomison, who was in charge of its construction, for Edmonton, Middlesex, England, home town of the Lake family \u2013 at least five of whom were influential members of the HBC between 1696-1807. Although both forts were initially successful, declines in beaver pelt hauls and firewood stocks forced both HBC and NWC to move their forts upstream.By 1813, after some changes in location, Fort Edmonton was established in the area of what is now Rossdale, beginning Edmonton's start as a permanent population centre. The fort was located on the border of territory that was disputed by the Blackfoot and Cree nations. Furthermore, the fort intersected territory patrolled by the Blackfoot Confederacy to the South, and the Cree, Dene, and Nakoda nations to the North. After the North West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Augustus was closed in favour of Fort Edmonton.In 1876, Treaty 6, which includes what is now Edmonton, was signed between the Indigenous peoples in Canada (or First Nations) and Queen Victoria as Queen of Canada, as part of the Numbered Treaties of Canada. The agreement includes the Plains and Woods Cree, Assiniboine, and other band governments of First Nations at Fort Carlton, Fort Pitt, and Battle River. The area covered by the treaty represents most of the central area of the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.The coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to southern Alberta in 1885 helped the Edmonton economy, and the 1891 building of the Calgary and Edmonton (C&E) Railway resulted in the emergence of a railway townsite (South Edmonton/Strathcona) on the river's south side, across from Edmonton. The arrival of the CPR and the C&E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs from eastern Canada, Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world. The Edmonton area's fertile soil and cheap land attracted settlers, further establishing Edmonton as a major regional commercial and agricultural centre. Some people participating in the Klondike Gold Rush passed through South Edmonton/Strathcona in 1897. Strathcona was North America's northernmost railway point, but travel to the Klondike was still very difficult for the \"Klondikers,\" and a majority of them took a steamship north to the Yukon from Vancouver, British Columbia.\n \nIncorporated as a town in 1892 with a population of 700 and then as a city in 1904 with a population of 8,350, Edmonton became the capital of Alberta when the province was formed a year later, on September 1, 1905. In November 1905, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) arrived in Edmonton, accelerating growth.During the early 1900s, Edmonton's rapid growth led to speculation in real estate. In 1912, Edmonton amalgamated with the City of Strathcona, south of the North Saskatchewan River; as a result, the city extended south of the North Saskatchewan River for the first time.Just before World War I, the boom ended, and the city's population declined from more than 72,000 in 1914 to less than 54,000 only two years later. Many impoverished families moved to subsistence farms outside the city, while others fled to greener pastures in other provinces. Recruitment to the army during the war also contributed to the drop in population. Afterwards, the city slowly recovered in population and economy during the 1920s and 1930s and took off again during and after World War II.\nThe Edmonton City Centre Airport opened in 1929, becoming Canada's first licensed airfield. Originally named Blatchford Field in honour of former mayor Kenny Blatchford, pioneering aviators such as Wilfrid R. \"Wop\" May and Max Ward used Blatchford Field as a major base for distributing mail, food, and medicine to Northern Canada; hence Edmonton's emergence as the \"Gateway to the North\". World War II saw Edmonton become a major base for the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Northwest Staging Route. The airport was closed in November 2013.On July 31, 1987, a devastating F4 tornado hit the city and killed 27 people. The storm hit the areas of Beaumont, Mill Woods, Bannerman, Fraser, and Evergreen. The day became known as \"Black Friday.\"\n\n\n=== History of municipal governance ===\n\nIn 1892 Edmonton was incorporated as a town. The first mayor was Matthew McCauley, who established the first school board in Edmonton and Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) and a municipal police service. Due to McCauley's good relationship with the federal Liberals, Edmonton maintained economic and political prominence over Strathcona, a rival settlement/town/city on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Edmonton was incorporated as a city in 1904 and became Alberta's capital in 1905.\nIn 1904, the City of Edmonton purchased the Edmonton District Telephone Company  for $17,000 from Alex Taylor (businessman), a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor and politician. Amalgamated into a city department as City of Edmonton Telephone Department, City Telephone System (CTS), 'edmonton telephones'. In 1989, City Council voted to create Edmonton Telephones Corporation  to operate as an autonomous organization under a board of directors appointed by the city. In 1995, City of Edmonton ownership of its telephone service ended when ED TEL was sold to the TELUS corporation. City Bylaw 11713 created The Ed Tel Endowment Fund whereas the shares owned by Edmonton Telephones Corporation in Ed Tel Inc. were sold by the City of Edmonton to Telus on March 10, 1995 for $470,221,872 to be invested for the perpetual benefit of Edmontonians. \nUnions and radical organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World struggled for progressive social change through the early years, with the first reformer, James East, elected in 1912, followed by the first official Labour alderman, James Kinney, the following year. Many thousands of workers participated in the Edmonton general strike of 1919 and a strong block of Labour representatives were on council after the next election: East, Kinney, Sam McCoppen, Rice Sheppard and Joe Clarke.\nThe City used Single Transferable Vote (STV), a form of proportional representation, for elections from 1923 to 1927, in which councillors were elected at large with ranked transferable votes.\nLabour representation on city council became a near-majority in 1929, and a full majority from 1932 to 1934, during the Great Depression. Jan Reimer became the city's first female mayor when she was elected in 1989.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nEdmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River, at an elevation of 671 m (2,201 ft). It is North America's northernmost city with a metropolitan population over one million. It is at the same latitude as Hamburg (Germany); Dublin (Ireland); Manchester (United Kingdom); and Magnitogorsk (Russia). It is south of Alberta's geographic centre, which is near the Hamlet of Fort Assiniboine. The terrain in and around Edmonton is generally flat to gently rolling, with ravines and deep river valleys, such as the North Saskatchewan River valley. The Canadian Rockies are west of Edmonton and about 220 km (140 mi) to the southwest.\nThe North Saskatchewan River originates at the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park and bisects the city. It sometimes floods Edmonton's river valley, most notably in the North Saskatchewan River flood of 1915. It empties via the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. It runs from the southwest to the northeast and is fed by numerous creeks throughout the city, including Mill Creek, Whitemud Creek and Blackmud Creek; these creeks have created ravines, some of which are used for urban parkland. Edmonton is within the Canadian Prairies Ecozone. Aspen parkland surrounds the city and is a transitional area from the prairies to the south and boreal forest in the north. The aspen woods and forests in and around Edmonton have long since been reduced by farming and residential and commercial developments including oil and natural gas exploration.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEdmonton has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dwb). It falls into the NRC 4a Plant Hardiness Zone.The city is known for having cold winters, though its weather is milder than Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, all of which are south of Edmonton. Its average daily temperatures range from a low of \u221210.4 \u00b0C (13.3 \u00b0F) in January to a summer peak of 17.7 \u00b0C (63.9 \u00b0F) in July. With average maximum of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F) in July, and minimum of \u221214.8 \u00b0C (5.4 \u00b0F) in January. Temperatures can exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for an average of four to five days anytime from late April to mid-September and fall below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) for an average of 24.6 days in the winter. The highest temperature recorded in Edmonton was 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), on June 29, 1937. On July 2, 2013, a record high humidex of 44 was recorded, due to an unusually humid day with a temperature of 33.9 \u00b0C (93.0 \u00b0F) and a record high dew point of 23 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Edmonton was \u221249.4 \u00b0C (\u221256.9 \u00b0F), on January 19 and 21, 1886.Summer lasts from late June until early September, and the humidity is seldom uncomfortably high. Winter lasts from November to March and varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short and highly variable. Edmonton's growing season is from May 9 to September 22; it averages 135-140 frost-free days a year. At the summer solstice, Edmonton receives 17 hours and three minutes of daylight, with an hour and 46 minutes of civil twilight. On average Edmonton receives 2,299 hours of bright sunshine per year and is one of Canada's sunniest cities.The summer of 2006 was particularly warm for Edmonton, as temperatures reached 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) or higher more than 20 times from mid-May to early September. The winter of 2011\u201312 was particularly warm; from December 22, 2011, till March 20, 2012, on 53 occasions Edmonton saw temperatures at or above 0.0 \u00b0C (32.0 \u00b0F) at the City Centre Airport, and even warmer in the city proper.Edmonton has a fairly dry climate. On average, it receives 476.9 mm (18.78 in) of precipitation, of which 365.7 mm (14.40 in) is rain and 111.2 mm (4.38 in) is the melt from 123.5 cm (48.6 in) of snowfall per annum. Precipitation is heaviest in the late spring, summer, and early autumn. The wettest month is July, while the driest months are February, March, October, and November. In July the mean precipitation is 91.7 mm (3.61 in). Dry spells are not uncommon and may occur at any time of the year. Extremes do occur, such as the 114 mm (4.49 in) of rainfall that fell on July 31, 1953. Summer thunderstorms can be frequent and occasionally severe enough to produce large hail, damaging winds, funnel clouds, and occasionally tornadoes. Twelve tornadoes had been recorded in Edmonton between 1890 and 1989, and eight since 1990. An F4 tornado that struck Edmonton on July 31, 1987, killing 27, was unusual in many respects, including severity, duration, damage, and casualties. It is commonly referred to as Black Friday due both to its aberrant characteristics and the emotional shock it generated. Then-mayor Laurence Decore cited the community's response to the tornado as evidence that Edmonton was a \"city of champions,\" which later became an unofficial slogan of the city.A massive cluster of thunderstorms occurred on July 11, 2004, with large hail and over 100 mm (4 in) of rain reported within an hour in many places. This \"1-in-200 year event\" flooded major intersections and underpasses and damaged both residential and commercial properties. The storm caused extensive damage to West Edmonton Mall; a small glass section of the roof collapsed under the weight of the rainwater, causing water to drain onto the mall's indoor ice rink. As a result, the mall was evacuated as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nEdmonton is at the centre of Canada's sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA), which includes Edmonton and 34 other municipalities in the surrounding area. Larger urban communities include Sherwood Park (an urban service area within Strathcona County), the cities of St. Albert, Beaumont, Leduc, Spruce Grove and Fort Saskatchewan, and the towns of Stony Plain, Morinville, and Devon. Major employment areas outside Edmonton but within the CMA include the Nisku Industrial Business Park and the Edmonton International Airport (including a planned inland port logistics support facility in support of the Port Alberta initiative) in Leduc County, the Acheson Industrial Area in Parkland County, Refinery Row in Strathcona County and Alberta's Industrial Heartland within portions of Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County and Sturgeon County. Alberta's Industrial Heartland also extends beyond the CMA's northeastern boundary into Lamont County.The individual economic development interests and costs of service delivery in certain municipalities within the region have led to intermunicipal competition, strained intermunicipal relationships and overall fragmentation of the region. Although several attempts have been made by the City of Edmonton to absorb surrounding municipalities or annex portions of its neighbours, the city has not absorbed another municipality since the Town of Jasper Place joined Edmonton on August 17, 1964, and the city has not annexed land from any of its neighbours since January 1, 1982. After years of mounting pressure in the early 21st century, the Province of Alberta formed the Capital Region Board (CRB) on April 15, 2008. The CRB consists of 24 member municipalities \u2013 22 of which are within the Edmonton CMA and two of which are outside the CMA. The City of Edmonton announced in March 2013 its intent to annex 156 square kilometres of land (including the Edmonton International Airport) from Leduc County.On November 30, 2016, the City of Edmonton and Leduc County came to an agreement on Edmonton's annexation proposal. The City of Edmonton was poised to annex 29,900 acres (121 km2) of land from Leduc County and Beaumont, including the Edmonton International Airport, as a result.On January 1, 2019, the City of Edmonton officially annexed 8,260 ha (82.6 km2) from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont, increasing the city's area to 767.85 km2 (296.47 sq mi), with discussions of annexing an additional 2,830 ha (28.3 km2) of Edmonton International Airport land still ongoing.\n\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n\nEdmonton is divided into 375 neighbourhoods within 7 geographic sectors\u2014a mature area sector, which includes neighbourhoods that were essentially built out before 1970, and six surrounding suburban sectors.Edmonton's Downtown is within the city's mature area or inner city. It and the surrounding Boyle Street, Central McDougall, Cloverdale, Garneau, McCauley, Oliver, Queen Mary Park, Riverdale, Rossdale, Strathcona and University of Alberta form Edmonton's Central Core. Oliver and Garneau are the city's most populated and most densely populated neighbourhoods respectively. The mature area sector also contains the five former urban municipalities annexed by the city over its history: Beverly, Jasper Place, North Edmonton, Strathcona and West Edmonton (Calder).Larger residential areas within Edmonton's six suburban sectors, each comprising multiple neighbourhoods, include Heritage Valley, Kaskitayo, Riverbend, Terwillegar Heights and Windermere (southwest sector); The Grange, Lewis Farms and West Jasper Place (west sector); Big Lake (northwest sector); Castle Downs, Lake District and The Palisades (north sector); Casselman-Steele Heights, Clareview, Hermitage, Londonderry and Pilot Sound (northeast sector); and Ellerslie, The Meadows, Mill Woods and Southeast Edmonton (southeast sector). Mill Woods is divided into a town centre community (Mill Woods Town Centre) and eight surrounding communities: Burnewood, Knottwood, Lakewood, Millbourne, Millhurst, Ridgewood, Southwood, and Woodvale. Each has between two and four neighbourhoods.\n\nSeveral transit-oriented developments (TOD) have begun to appear along the LRT line at Clareview, with future developments planned at Belvedere (part of the Old Town Fort Road Redevelopment Project). Another TOD, Century Park, is being constructed at the site of what was once Heritage Mall, at the southern end of the LRT line. Century Park will eventually house up to 5,000 residents.The Edmonton City Centre Airport is planned to be redeveloped into a sustainable community of 30,000 people comprising a transit-oriented mixed use town centre, townhouses, low, medium and high rise apartments, neighbourhood retail and service uses, and a major park.Edmonton has four major industrial districts: the Northwest Industrial District, the Northeast Industrial District, the Southeast Industrial District, and the emerging Edmonton Energy and Technology Park, which is part of Alberta's Industrial Heartland. The northwest, northeast and southeast districts each have smaller industrial areas and neighbourhoods within them.The city has established 12 business revitalization zones: 124 Street and Area, Alberta Avenue, Beverly, Downtown, Chinatown and Little Italy, Fort Road and Area, Inglewood, Kingsway, North Edge, Northwest Industrial, Old Strathcona and Stony Plain Road.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of the City of Edmonton according to its 2019 municipal census is 972,223, a change of 8.1% from its 2016 municipal census population of 899,447. After factoring in dwellings that did not respond to the municipal census, Edmonton's population is further estimated to be 992,812. Per its municipal census policy, the city's next municipal census is scheduled for 2020.In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Edmonton recorded a population of 932,546 living in 360,828 of its 387,950 total private dwellings, a change of 14.8% from its 2011 population of 812,201. With a land area of 685.25 km2 (264.58 sq mi), it had a population density of 1,360.9/km2 (3,524.7/sq mi) in 2016.The 2016 municipal census captured more detailed demographic information on residents, including age and gender, marital status, employment status, length of residency, prior residence, employment transportation mode, citizenship, school residency, economic diversity, city resource access, highest educational attainment, household language and income, as well as dwellings and properties, including ownership, structure and status.In the 2011 Census, the City of Edmonton had a population of 812,201 living in 324,756 of its 348,672 total dwellings, a change of 11.2% from its 2006 population of 730,372. With a land area of 684.37 km2 (264.24 sq mi), it had a population density of 1,186.8/km2 (3,073.8/sq mi) in 2011. The census also reported that 50.2 percent of the population (407,325) was female while 49.8 percent (404,875) was male. The average age of the city's population was 36.0 years while there was an average 2.5 people per household.The Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) has the fifth-greatest population of CMAs in Canada and the second-greatest in Alberta, but has the largest land area in Canada. It had a population of 1,159,869 in the 2011 Census compared to its 2006 population of 1,034,945. Its five-year population change of 12.1 percent was second only to the Calgary CMA between 2006 and 2011. With a land area of 9,426.73 km2 (3,639.68 sq mi), the Edmonton CMA had a population density of 123.0/km2 (318.7/sq mi) in 2011. Statistics Canada's latest estimate of the Edmonton CMA population, as of July 1, 2016 is 1,363,300The Edmonton population centre is the core of the Edmonton CMA. This core includes the cities of Edmonton, Fort Saskatchewan and St. Albert, the Sherwood Park portion of Strathcona County, and portions of Parkland County and Sturgeon County. The Edmonton population centre, the fifth-largest in Canada, had a population of 960,015 in 2011, an 11.3 percent increase over its 2006 population of 862,544.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nAccording to the 2016 census, 55.8% of Edmonton's population were of European ethnicities, the most frequent of which included the English (16.8%), Scottish (13.8%), German (13.6%), Irish (12.5%), Ukrainian (10.8%), French (9.4%), and Polish (5.1%) origins. Other ethnic groups and origins included, among others:\nCanadian (17.4%);\nEast and Southeast Asian (15.9%) (7.4% Chinese, 6.2% Filipino, and 1.5% Vietnamese);\nSouth Asian (9.5%) (7.4% Indian));\nAboriginal (6.4% (4% First Nations and 2.7% M\u00e9tis);\nAfrican (6.1%);\nLatin, Central and South American (2.3%);\nWest Central Asian and Middle Eastern (4% (1.5% Lebanese); and\nCaribbean (1.4%).The 2016 census also reported that 37.1% of Edmonton's population identified themselves as visible minorities. The most frequent visible minorities included South Asian (9.5%), Chinese  (6.3%), Black (5.9%), Filipino (5.9%), and Arab (2.6%).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nEdmonton is home to members of a number of world religions. According to the 2011 Canadian Household Survey, 59.1 percent of metropolitan Edmonton residents identify as Christian. Significant religious minorities include Muslims (4.1 percent), Sikhs (1.8 percent), Buddhists (1.5 percent), Hindus (1.4 percent), Jewish people (0.3 percent), and practitioners of traditional Aboriginal spirituality (0.2 percent). Those belonging to smaller religions account for 0.5 percent, while 31.1 percent profess no religious affiliation.Within Christianity, major denominations include the Roman Catholic Church (44.4 percent of self-identified Christians) and the United Church (10.5 percent). Edmonton is home to four major cathedrals, with St. Joseph's Basilica seating the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton, All Saints' Cathedral seating the Anglican Diocese of Edmonton, St. Josaphat Cathedral seating the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and St. John Cathedral seating the Ukrainian Orthodox Eparchy of Western Canada. Additionally, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are served by the Edmonton Alberta Temple.\nIn the 1930s, the local Muslim community began organizing to build a mosque. A local Muslim woman, Hilwie Hamdon, met with the mayor to acquire the land, and campaigned to raise $5,000 for the building. In 1938, Abdullah Yusuf Ali was present at the opening of the new Al-Rashid Mosque, which became the first mosque established in Canada and the third in North America. In the 1980s, Muslim students at the University of Alberta found it difficult to rent prayer rooms large enough to accommodate the local population, and opened the Muslim Community of Edmonton as a mosque and outreach centre in 1992. From these beginnings, Muslims now form the city's largest religious minority, with 46,125 members (2011) representing over 62 ethnic backgrounds at over 20 Edmonton-area mosques (2019).Edmonton's Jewish community is represented by the Jewish Federation of Edmonton, operating the historic Edmonton Jewish Cemetery, purchased in 1907. The city contains six synagogues. The oldest, Beth Israel, was established in 1912 and served as home of Canada's first Jewish day school. Other Abrahamic religions active in Edmonton include the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, operating a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Centre in Norwood, and Druze, with its Canadian Druze Centre located in the Northwest Industrial District.\n\nEdmonton also hosts a Maronite Catholic church, on 76 Avenue/98 Street, with services in English on Saturdays and Arabic on Sundays. The Hindu Community in Edmonton is served by the Hindu Society of Alberta (North Indian Temple) and the Maha Ganapathy Society of Alberta (South Indian Temple). The Sikh community in Edmonton is served by four gurdwaras. Edmonton is also home to two of Alberta's five Unitarian Universalist congregations \u2013 the Unitarian Church of Edmonton and the Westwood Unitarian Congregation; the other three are located in Calgary, Lethbridge, and Red Deer.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEdmonton is the major economic centre for northern and central Alberta and a major centre for the oil and gas industry. As of 2014, the estimated value of major projects within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region was $57.8-billion, of which $34.4-billion are within the oil and gas, oil sands, and pipeline sectors.Edmonton traditionally has been a hub for Albertan petrochemical industries, earning it the nickname \"Oil Capital of Canada\" in the 1940s. Supply and service industries drive the energy extraction engine, while research develops new technologies and supports expanded value-added processing of Alberta's massive oil, gas, and oil sands reserves. These are reported to be the second-largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia.Much of the growth in technology sectors is due to Edmonton's reputation as one of Canada's premier research and education centres. Research initiatives are anchored by educational institutions such as the University of Alberta (U of A) as well as government initiatives underway at Alberta Innovates and Edmonton Research Park. The U of A campus is home to the National Institute for Nanotechnology.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Edmonton became a major financial centre, with both regional offices of Canada's major banks and locally based institutions opening. However, the turmoil of the late-1980s economy radically changed the situation. Locally based operations such as Principal Trust and Canadian Commercial Bank would fail, and some regional offices were moved to other cities. The 1990s saw a solidification of the economy, and Edmonton is now home to Canadian Western Bank, the only publicly traded Schedule I chartered bank headquarters west of Toronto. Other major financial institutions include ATB Financial, Servus Credit Union (formerly Capital City Savings), TD Canada Trust and Manulife Financial.Edmonton has been the birthplace of several companies that have grown to international stature. The local retail market has also seen the creation of many successful store concepts, such as The Brick, Katz Group, AutoCanada, Boston Pizza, Pizza 73, Liquor Stores GP (which includes Liquor Depot, Liquor Barn, OK Liquor, and Grapes & Grains), Planet Organic, Shaw Communications, Empire Design, Running Room, Booster Juice, Earl's, Fountain Tire and XS Cargo.Edmonton's geographical location has made it an ideal spot for distribution and logistics. CN Rail's North American operational facility is located in the city, as well as a major intermodal facility that handles all incoming freight from the port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia. In early 2020, CN Rail announced that it was closing its Montreal control centre and would eventually close its Vancouver control centre as well, with a goal to consolidate all of its control operations into Edmonton.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nEdmonton is home to several shopping malls and the largest mall in North America, West Edmonton Mall, which is also considered to be the 10th largest mall in the world. Other mentionable malls include Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre, Edmonton City Centre (a combination of the former Edmonton Centre and Eaton Centre malls), Southgate Centre, Kingsway Mall, Northgate Centre, Riverview Crossing, Londonderry Mall, and Mill Woods Town Centre.Edmonton also has many big box shopping centres and power centres. Some of the major ones include South Edmonton Common (North America's largest open air retail development), Mayfield Common, Westpoint, Skyview Power Centre, Terra Losa Centre, Oliver Square, Southpark Centre, The Meadows, Christy's Corner, Currents of Windermere, and Manning Village.In contrast to suburban centres, Edmonton has many urban retail locations. The largest of them all, Old Strathcona, includes many independent stores between 99 Street and 109 Street, on Whyte Avenue and in the surrounding area. In and around Downtown Edmonton, there are a few shopping districts, including the Edmonton City Centre mall, Jasper Avenue, and 104 Street. Near Oliver, 124 Street is home to a significant number of retail stores. Edmonton is the Canadian testing ground for many American retailers, such as Bath & Body Works and Calvin Klein.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\nMany events are anchored in the downtown Arts District, centred around Churchill Square (named in honour of Sir Winston Churchill). On the south side of the river, the University district and Whyte Avenue contain theatres, concert halls, and various live music venues. The centrepiece of the square builds a life-size bronze statue of Churchill, unveiled by Lady Soames on May 24, 1989. It is a copy of a statue by Oscar Nemon.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe Francis Winspear Centre for Music opened in 1997 after years of planning and fundraising. Described as one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in Canada, it is home to the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and hosts a wide variety of shows every year. It seats 1,932 patrons and houses the $3-million Davis Concert Organ, the largest concert organ in Canada. Across 102 Avenue is the Citadel Theatre, named after The Salvation Army Citadel in which Joe Shoctor first started the Citadel Theatre Company in 1965. It is now one of the largest theatre complexes in Canada, with five halls, each specializing in different kinds of productions. In 2015 the Citadel Theatre also became home to Catalyst Theatre. On the University of Alberta grounds is the 2,534-seat Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, which had over a year of heavy renovations as part of the province's 2005 centennial celebrations. Both it and its southern twin in Calgary were constructed in 1955 for the province's golden jubilee and have hosted many concerts, musicals, and ballets. On the front of the building is a quote from Suetonius' Life of Augustus: \"He found a city built of brick \u2013 left it built of marble.\"\nThe Old Strathcona neighbourhood is home to the Theatre District, which holds the ATB Financial Arts Barns (headquarters of the Edmonton International Fringe Festival), The Walterdale Playhouse, and the Varscona Theatre (base of operations for several theatre companies, including Teatro la Quindicina, Shadow Theatre, Die-Nasty, Plane Jane Theatre, and Grindstone Theatre!). Edmonton was named cultural capital of Canada in 2007. The Ukrainian Dnipro Ensemble of Edmonton, along with other Ukrainian choirs such as the Ukrainian Male Chorus of Edmonton, helps preserve the Ukrainian musical culture within the parameters of the Canadian multicultural identity in Edmonton.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nEdmonton hosts several large festivals each year, contributing to its nickname, \"Canada's Festival City\". Downtown Edmonton's Churchill Square host numerous festivals each summer. The Works Art & Design Festival, which takes place from late June to early July, showcases Canadian and international art and design from well-known award-winning artists as well as emerging and student artists. The Edmonton International Street Performer's Festival takes place in mid-July and is the biggest of its kind in North America. The TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival takes place in late June and, along with Montreal, were the first jazz festivals in Canada.\n\nEdmonton's main summer festival is K-Days, formerly Klondike Days, Capital Ex and originally the Edmonton Exhibition. Founded in 1879, the Edmonton Exhibition was originally an annual fair and exhibition that eventually adopted a gold rush theme, becoming Klondike Days in the 1960s. Northlands, the operators, renamed the festival \"Edmonton's Capital Ex\" or \"Capital Ex\" in 2006. In 2012 Edmonton Northlands conducted a poll to rename the festival that resulted in changing the name to \"K-Days\".  The Canadian Finals Rodeo was held in Edmonton from 1974 to 2017, but moved to Red Deer in 2018 due to the closure of the Coliseum.The Edmonton International Fringe Festival, held in mid-August, is the largest fringe theatre festival in North America. Also in August Edmonton hosts the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, the fourth major folk festival in Canada. Other summer festivals in and around Edmonton include the Edmonton Heritage Festival, Taste of Edmonton, Chaos Alberta Festival, Interstellar Rodeo, Big Valley Jambore, Pigeon Lake Music Festival, Edmonton Rockfest, Edmonton International Reggae Jamboree Festival, Edmonton Blues Festival and Cariwest. Edmonton also hosts a number of winter festivals, one of the oldest being the Silver Skate Festival. Others are Flying Canoe Volant, Ice on Whyte and the Ice Magic Festival.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIn the city's early days, music was performed in churches and community halls. Edmonton has a history of opera and classical music performance; both have been supported by a variety of clubs and associations. Edmonton's first major radio station, CKUA, began broadcasting music in 1927. The city is a centre for music instruction; the University of Alberta began its music department in 1945, and MacEwan University opened a jazz and musical theatre program in 1980. Festivals of jazz, folk, and classical music are popular entertainment events in the city.The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra has existed under various incarnations since 1913. In 1952 the Edmonton Philharmonic and the Edmonton Pops orchestras amalgamated to form the 60-member modern version. The Orchestra performs at the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.The city also has a vibrant popular music scene, across genres including hip-hop, reggae, R&B, rock, pop, metal, punk, country and electronic. Notable past and present local musicians include Robert Goulet, Tommy Banks, Stu Davis, Tim Feehan, Cadence Weapon, Kreesha Turner, The Smalls, SNFU, Social Code, Stereos, Ten Second Epic, Tupelo Honey, Mac DeMarco, Shout Out Out Out Out, Psyche, Purity Ring, The Wet Secrets, Nuela Charles, Celeigh Cardinal, and Ruth B.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nThere are several key areas of nightlife in Edmonton. The most popular is the Whyte Avenue (82 Avenue) strip, between 109 Street and 99 Street; it has the highest number of heritage buildings in Edmonton, and bars, clubs, and restaurants throughout, but mostly west of Gateway Boulevard (103 Street). Once the heart of the town of Strathcona (annexed by Edmonton on February 1, 1912), it fell into disrepair during the middle of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, a coordinated effort to revive the area through a business revitalization zone produced an area rich with restored historical buildings and pleasant streetscapes. Its proximity to the University of Alberta has led to a high number of restaurants, pubs, trendy clubs, and retail and specialty shops. This area also has two independent movie theatres, the Garneau and Princess, as well as several live theatre, music, and comedy venues.Downtown Edmonton has undergone a continual process of renewal and growth since the mid-1990s. Many buildings were demolished during the oil boom, starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s, to make way for office towers. There have always been numerous pub-type establishments, hotel lounges, and restaurants. The past decade has seen a strong resurgence in more mainstream venues. Edmonton also has a high demand for pub crawl tours in the city. Various clubs are found along Edmonton's main street, Jasper Avenue. The Edmonton City Centre mall also houses a Landmark Cinemas movie theatre with nine screens. The nonprofit Metro Cinema shows a variety of alternative or otherwise unreleased films every week.\nWest Edmonton Mall holds several after-hour establishments in addition to its many stores and attractions. Bourbon Street has numerous eating establishments; clubs and casinos can also be found within the complex. Scotiabank Theatre (formerly known as Silver City), at the west end of the mall, is a theatre with 12 screens and an IMAX.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Parkland and environment ===\n\nEdmonton's river valley constitutes the longest stretch of connected urban parkland in North America, and Edmonton has the highest amount of parkland per capita of any Canadian city; the river valley is 22 times larger than New York City's Central Park. The river valley is home to various parks ranging from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities. This main \"Ribbon of Green\" is supplemented by numerous neighbourhood parks located throughout the city, to give a total of 111 km2 (27,400 acres) of parkland. Within the 7,400 ha (18,000 acres), 25 km (16 mi)-long river valley park system, there are 11 lakes, 14 ravines, and 22 major parks, and most of the city has accessible bike and walking trail connections. These trails are also part of the 235 km (146 mi) Waskahegan walking trail. The City of Edmonton has named five parks in its River Valley Parks System in honour of each of \"The Famous Five\".\n\nEdmonton's streets and parklands also contain one of the largest remaining concentrations of healthy American elm trees in the world, unaffected by Dutch elm disease, which has wiped out vast numbers of such trees in eastern North America. Jack pine, lodgepole pine, white spruce, white birch, aspen, mountain ash, Amur maple, Russian olive, green ash, basswood, various poplars and willows, flowering crabapple, Mayday tree and Manitoba maple are also abundant; bur oak, silver maple, hawthorn and Ohio buckeye are increasingly popular. Other introduced tree species include white ash, blue spruce, Norway maple, red oak, sugar maple, common horse-chestnut, McIntosh apple, and Evans cherry. Three walnut species \u2013 butternut, Manchurian walnut, and black walnut \u2013 have survived in Edmonton.Several golf courses, both public and private, are also located in the river valley; the long summer daylight hours of this northern city provide for extended play from early morning well into the evening. Golf courses and the park system become a winter recreation area during this season, and cross-country skiing and skating are popular during the long winter. Four downhill ski slopes are located in the river valley as well, two within the city and two immediately outside.\n\nThe Edmonton & Area Land Trust (EALT) is a charity focused on conserving natural areas in Edmonton and surrounding municipalities. Its first project in Edmonton was conserving Larch Sanctuary, via a 59-acre Conservation Easement with the City, straddling Whitemud Creek south of 23rd Avenue, and containing the only oxbow lake in the City. EALT works with many organisations in Edmonton, and is currently working to conserve the 233 acres of Forest and Farmland in a loop of the river in North East Edmonton.\nA variety of volunteer opportunities exist for citizens to participate in the stewardship of Edmonton's parkland and river valley. Volunteer programs include River Valley Clean-up, Root for Trees, and Partner in Parks.  River Valley Clean-up engages volunteers to pick up hundreds of bags of litter each year.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThere are many museums in Edmonton of various sizes.  The largest is the Royal Alberta Museum (RAM), which was formerly known as the Provincial Museum of Alberta until it was renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's 2005 Alberta centennial visit. The RAM houses over 10 million objects in its collection and showcases the culture and practices of the diverse aboriginal tribes of the region. In 2018, the building relocated from its location in Glenora to a new building in downtown on 103A Avenue and 97 Street. The museum held a grand opening event and gave out 40,000 free tickets for its first few days of operation.The Telus World of Science is located in the Woodcroft neighbourhood northwest of the city centre. It opened in 1984 and has since been expanded several times. It contains five permanent galleries, one additional gallery for temporary exhibits, an IMAX theatre, a planetarium, an observatory, and an amateur radio station.  The Edmonton Valley Zoo is in the river valley to the southwest of the city centre.The Alberta Aviation Museum, located in a hangar at the City Centre Airport, was built for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Its collection includes both civilian and military aircraft, the largest of which are a Boeing 737 and two CF-101 Voodoos. It also has one of only 3 BOMARC missiles in Canada.\n\nThe Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre is home to the Loyal Edmonton Regiment Military Museum. The museum is dedicated to preserving the military heritage and the sacrifices made by the people of Edmonton and Alberta in general. The museum features two galleries and several smaller exhibits. The collection includes historic firearms, uniforms, souvenirs, memorabilia, military accoutrements, as well as a large photographic and archival collection spanning the pre-World War One period to the present. The museum features an exhibit on the role of the 49th Battalion, CEF in Canada's Hundred Days Offensive.\nThe Telephone Historical Centre is a telephone museum also located in the Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre. In addition to a collection of artifacts tracing the history of the telephone, the museum has its own theatre featuring a brief film led by the robot Xeldon. As of April, 2019, the museum is permanently closed.The Alberta Railway Museum is located in the rural northeast portion of the city. It contains a variety of locomotives and railroad cars from different periods, and includes a working steam locomotive. Since most of its exhibits are outdoors, it is only open between Victoria Day and Labour Day.\n\nFort Edmonton Park, Canada's largest living history museum, is located in the river valley southwest of the city centre. Edmonton's heritage is displayed through historical buildings (many of which are originals moved to the park), costumed historical interpreters, and authentic artifacts. In total, it covers the region's history from approximately 1795 to 1929 (represented by Fort Edmonton), followed chronologically by 1885, 1905, and 1920 streets, and a recreation of a 1920s midway. A steam train, streetcars, automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles may be seen in operation (and utilized by the public) around the park. The John Walter Museum and Historical Area (c. 1875 to 1901) is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.  The University of Alberta operates its own internal Museums and Collections service.The Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is the city's largest single gallery. Formerly housed in an iconic 1970s Brutalist building designed by Don Bittorf, the AGA collection had over 5,000 pieces of art. The former AGA building was demolished in July 2007 to make way for construction of a new facility designed by Randall Stout. It was estimated to cost over $88-million and the amount that Edmonton City Council donated towards its construction was met with some controversy. The AGA officially opened on January 31, 2010. Commercial art galleries can be found throughout the city, especially along the 124 Street/Jasper Avenue corridor, known as the \"gallery walk\".Edmonton is home to four artist-run centres all located in the downtown core Harcourt House, Latitude 53, Ociciwan Contemporary Art Collective and Society of Northern Alberta Print-Artists (SNAP). The University of Alberta and MacEwan University also have galleries: the Fine Arts Building Gallery and the Mitchell Art Gallery, respectively. The University of Alberta Museums and Collections also has 17 million objects, 29 registered museum collections and occasional exhibitions.\n\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\n\nEdmonton has a number of professional sports teams, including the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League, and FC Edmonton of the Canadian Premier League. Junior sports clubs include the Edmonton Huskies and Edmonton Wildcats of the Canadian Junior Football League and the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League. Venues for Edmonton's professional and junior sports teams include Commonwealth Stadium (Eskimos), Argyll Velodrome, Rogers Place (Oilers and Oil Kings), Edmonton Ballpark (Prospects), the Universiade Pavilion (Energy), and Clarke Stadium (FC Edmonton, Huskies and Wildcats).\n\nEdmonton's teams have rivalries with Calgary's teams and games between Edmonton and Calgary teams are often referred to as the Battle of Alberta.\nPast notable hockey teams in Edmonton include: the original junior hockey incarnation of the Edmonton Oil Kings, with multiple league and national Memorial Cup championships playing in the Western Hockey League; the Edmonton Flyers, with multiple Lester Patrick Cups and one national Allan Cup, and; the Edmonton Roadrunners of the American Hockey League.  Other past notable sports teams include; the Edmonton Grads, a women's basketball team with 108 local, provincial, national, and international titles and the world champions for 17 years in a row; the Edmonton Trappers, a Triple-A level baseball team with multiple division and league titles in the Pacific Coast League, and; the Edmonton Rush, a box lacrosse team with one league championship.\nLocal university-level sports teams include the U of A Golden Bears, the U of A Pandas, the NAIT Ooks, and the MacEwan Griffins. Local amateur teams, among others, include the Edmonton Gold of the Rugby Canada Super League and two flat track roller derby leagues: Oil City Roller Derby and E-Ville Roller Derby.The Castrol Raceway hosts regular sprint car and a national IHRA events at their facility next to Edmonton International Airport. The airport also hosts horse racing at the Century Mile Racetrack and Casino.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, Edmonton hosted an annual circuit on the Indy Racing League known as the Edmonton Indy. Other past sporting events hosted by Edmonton include the 1978 Commonwealth Games, the 1983 World University Games (Universiade), the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, the 2002 World Ringette Championships, the 2005 World Master Games, the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup, the 2007 and 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and the CN Canadian Women's Open. Edmonton shared hosting duties with Calgary for the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Edmonton is one of the venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe Edmonton City Council consists of a mayor and twelve councillors serving four-year terms. Each councillor is elected in a ward (electoral district); the mayor is elected at-large. The elections are non-partisan. Council has the responsibility of approving the city's budget, and develops laws and policies intended to promote the health and safety of Edmonton residents. The Council passes all legislation related to the city's police, firefighting, parks, libraries, and electricity, water supply, solid waste, and drainage utilities.\nOn July 22, 2009, City Council adopted an electoral system that divides Edmonton into 12 wards, instead of the previous two for each of six wards. This system came into effect with the following election in October 2010. The most recent election was held in October 2017, and elected members to a four-year term.\n\n\n=== Provincial politics ===\n\nEdmonton is the capital of the province of Alberta and holds all main provincial areas of government such as the Provincial Legislature of Alberta. The Edmonton Metropolitan Region is represented by 20 MLAs, one for each provincial electoral district. Many of these boundaries have been changed, adjusted and renamed while the city has grown. In the current 30th Alberta Legislature nearly all of Edmonton's districts are represented by members from the Opposition Alberta New Democratic Party. One of the MLAs, Rachel Notley, is also the Leader of the Opposition.\n\n\n=== Federal politics ===\nEdmonton is represented by nine Members of Parliament (MP), with one being elected to represent each of its federal electoral districts. In the current 43rd Canadian Parliament, eight MPs are members of the Conservative Party of Canada, while the remaining MP is part of the New Democratic Party. After the 2019 federal election, Edmonton lacked elected representation in the federal government for the first time since 1980.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe city's police force, the Edmonton Police Service, was founded in 1892, and had approximately 1,400 officers in 2012. Edmonton experienced a decrease in crime in the 1990s, an increase in the early 2000s, and another downturn at the end of the decade.\n\nThe Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) had a crime severity index of 84.5 in 2013, which is higher than the national average of 68.7. Its crime severity index was the fifth-highest among CMAs in Canada behind Regina, Saskatoon, Kelowna and Vancouver. Edmonton had the fourth-most homicides in 2013 at 27.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nEdmonton is home to 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), the Regular Force army brigade group of Land Force Western Area of the Canadian Army. Units in 1 CMBG include Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), 1 Combat Engineer Regiment, two of the three regular force battalions of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and various headquarters, service, and support elements. Although not part of 1 CMBG, 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron and 1 Field Ambulance are located with the brigade group.  All of these units are located at Lancaster Park, immediately north of the city. From 1943, as CFB Namao (now CFB Edmonton/Edmonton Garrison), it was a major air force base.  In 1996, all fixed-wing aviation units were transferred to CFB Cold Lake.\nThe Canadian Airborne Training Centre had been located in the city in the 1980s. The move of 1 CMBG and component units from Calgary occurred in 1996 in what was described as a cost-saving measure. The brigade had existed in Calgary since the 1950s, and Lord Strathcona's Horse had traditionally been a Calgary garrison unit dating back to before World War I.\nEdmonton also has a large army reserve element from 41 Canadian Brigade Group (41 CBG), including The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (4th Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry); 41 Combat Engineer Regiment; HQ Battery, 20th Field Artillery Regiment; and B Squadron of The South Alberta Light Horse, one of Alberta's oldest army reserve units. Despite being far from Canada's coasts, Edmonton is also the home of HMCS Nonsuch, a naval reserve division. There are numerous cadet corps of the different elements (naval, army and air force) within Edmonton as well.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Aviation ====\n\nEdmonton is a major air transportation gateway to northern Alberta and northern Canada. The Edmonton International Airport (EIA) is the main airport serving the city.\nThe EIA provides passenger service to destinations in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The EIA is located within Leduc County, adjacent to the City of Leduc and the Nisku Industrial Business Park. With direct air distances from Edmonton to places such as London in United Kingdom being shorter than to other main airports in western North America, Edmonton Airports is working to establish a major container shipping hub called Port Alberta.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nEdmonton serves as a major transportation hub for Canadian National Railway, whose North American operations management centre is located at their Edmonton offices. It is also tied into the Canadian Pacific Railway network, which provides service from Calgary to the south and extends northeast of Edmonton to serve Alberta's Industrial Heartland.\nInter-city rail passenger rail service is provided by Via Rail's premier train, the Canadian, as it travels between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario. Passenger trains stop at the Edmonton railway station three days a week in both directions. The train connects Edmonton to multiple stops in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\n\nThe Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) is the city's public transit agency, operating the Edmonton Light Rail Transit (LRT) line as well as a fleet of buses. As of 2009 there were 354,440 boardings per day (in a population of 1,034,945). There are approximately 280,000 ETS bus boardings, 54,000 LRT boardings, and 3,500 paratransit boardings per weekday.From the 1990s to early 2009, Edmonton was one of two cities in Canada still operating trolley buses, along with Vancouver. On June 18, 2008, City Council decided to abandon the Edmonton trolley bus system and the last trolley bus ran on May 2, 2009.Scheduled LRT service began on April 23, 1978, with five extensions of the single line completed since. The original Edmonton line is considered to be the first \"modern\" light rail line in North America (i.e., built from scratch, rather than being an upgrade of an old system). It introduced the use of German-designed rolling stock that subsequently became the standard light rail vehicle of the United States. The Edmonton \"proof-of-payment\" fare collection system adopted in 1980 \u2013 modelled after European ticket systems \u2013 became the North American transit industry's preferred approach for subsequent light rail projects. The four-year South LRT extension was opened in full on April 24, 2010, which sees trains travelling to Century Park (located at 23 Avenue and 111 Street), making stops at South Campus and Southgate Centre along the way. A line to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in north-central Edmonton using the same high floor technology of the existing system opened September 6, 2015. Edmonton currently constructing the southeast leg of the Valley Line, which starts in Mill Woods and ends in the downtown core. The southeast portion is expected to open in 2021, after experiencing significant delays. Construction on the second and final phase of the Valley Line, which will extend the line west to Lewis Farms, is expected to commence in 2021. Unlike the Capital and Metro lines, trains on the Valley Line will utilize low-floor technology.\n\nA largely gridded system forms most of Edmonton's street and road network. The address system is mostly numbered, with streets running south to north and avenues running east to west. In built-up areas built since the 1950s, local streets and major roadways generally do not conform to the grid system. Major roadways include Kingsway, Yellowhead Trail (Highway 16), Whitemud Drive and Anthony Henday Drive.\nThe major roads connecting to other communities elsewhere in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan are the Yellowhead Highway to the west and east and Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway) to the south.\n\n\n==== Trail system ====\nEdmonton maintains over 160 kilometres (99 mi) of multi-use trails; however, most of this is within the river valley parkland system.\n\n\n=== Electricity and water ===\nEdmonton's first power company established itself in 1891 and installed streetlights along the city's main avenue, Jasper Avenue. The power company was bought by the Town of Edmonton in 1902 and remains under municipal ownership today as EPCOR. Also in charge of water treatment, in 2002 EPCOR installed the world's largest ultraviolet (UV) water treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) system at its E. L. Smith Water Treatment Plant.\n\n\n=== Waste disposal ===\n\nThe Edmonton Composting Facility, the largest of its type in the world, is also the largest stainless steel building in North America. Among the innovative uses for the city's waste includes a Christmas tree recycling program. The trees are collected each January and put through a woodchipper; this material is used as an addition to the composting process. In addition, the wood chips absorb much of the odour produced by the compost by providing a biofilter element to trap odour causing gaseous results of the process. The composting facility was permanently shut down in 2019 after an inspection found that the structural integrity of its roof was compromised.  Edmonton is currently operating a pilot project for organics waste collection, with approximately 8,000 households in thirteen different neighbourhoods participating.Together, the Waste Management Centre and Wastewater Treatment plant are known as the Edmonton Waste Management Centre of Excellence. Research partners include the University of Alberta, the Alberta Research Council, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, and Olds College.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nThere are four main hospitals serving Edmonton: University of Alberta Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital, Misericordia Community Hospital, and Grey Nuns Community Hospital. Other area hospitals include Sturgeon Community Hospital in St. Albert, Leduc Community Hospital in Leduc, Westview Health Centre in Stony Plain, and Fort Saskatchewan Community Hospital in Fort Saskatchewan. Dedicated psychiatric care is provided at the Alberta Hospital. The Northeast Community Health Centre offers a 24-hour emergency room with no inpatient ward services. The University of Alberta Hospital is the centre of a larger complex of hospitals and clinics located adjacent to the university campus which comprises the Stollery Children's Hospital, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Cross Cancer Institute, Zeidler Gastrointestinal Health Centre, Ledcor Clinical Training Centre, and Edmonton Clinic. Several health research institutes, including the Heritage Medical Research Centre, Medical Sciences Building, Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, and Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, are also located at this site. A similar set-up is also evident at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, which is connected to the Lois Hole Hospital for Women and Orthopaedic Surgery Centre. All hospitals are under the administration of Alberta Health Services, although Misericordia and Grey Nuns are run separately by Covenant Health.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary ===\nEdmonton has three publicly funded school boards (districts) that provide kindergarten and grades 1\u201312. The vast majority of students attend schools in the two large English-language boards: Edmonton Public Schools, and the separate Edmonton Catholic School District. Also, since 1994, the Francophone minority community has had their own school board based in Edmonton, the Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 2, which includes surrounding communities. The city also has a number of public charter schools that are independent of any board. All three school boards and public charter schools are funded through provincial grants and property taxes.\nSome private schools exist as well, including Edmonton Academy, Progressive Academy and Tempo School.Edmonton Public Schools is known for pioneering the concept of site-based decision making (decentralization) in Canada, which gives principals the authority, the financial resources and the flexibility to make decisions based on the individual needs of their schools. This initiative has led to Edmonton Public offering an school of choice model in which students have more options as to what school they want to attend to suit their interests, and has led to the creation of alternative programs such as Vimy Ridge Academy, Old Scona Academic and Victoria School of the Arts. The Edmonton Society for Christian Education and Millwoods Christian School (not part of the former) used to be private schools; however, have both also become part of Edmonton Public Schools as alternative programs.Both the Edmonton Public Schools and the Edmonton Catholic School District provide support and resources for those wishing to homeschool their children.\n\n\n=== Post-secondary ===\n\nThose post-secondary institutions based in Edmonton that are publicly funded include Concordia University of Edmonton, MacEwan University, King's University, NorQuest College, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) and the University of Alberta (U of A).

        "wiki": "World Waterpark is a water park located at West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Opened to the public in 1986, it is the largest indoor water park in North America and will be surpassed by American Dream's DreamWorks Water Park when it opens at an undetermined date. It has a maximum capacity of 5000 guests, an average air temperature of 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) and contains the world's largest indoor wave pool with a capacity of 12.5 million litres.The highest slides in the park are Twister and Cyclone, which are both 83 feet (25 m) high.\n\n\n== Blue Thunder wave pool ==\nThis wave pool has four active wave bays, each with 2 panels operated by a 1,500 horsepower (1,100 kW) hydraulic system (8 total active panels). For many years, the (4) panels in the two outer wave bays have been disabled, apparently due to the waves being far too intense, resulting in injuries; guests were being thrown into each other when all 12 panels were operating, as they were in the 1980s.\nWaves are generated (in 10 minutes on, 5 minutes off sessions) of approximately 4 to 5 feet, utilizing only the 8 active wave panels. It is arguably the most popular attraction in the park, as many swimmers (most with inner tubes) can be found bobbing in the water. The start of every session is marked with a loud air horn blast, warning swimmers to be ready for a wave to flip them over. Every now and then, the large crowd of people in the pool will jokingly scream after hearing the air horn, a common behavior among frequent users of the wave pool.Most evenings, after regular park business hours, the Blue Thunder wave pool is used by clubs for surfing, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding. For these activities, the waves are often programmed for increased intensity and continuous operation.\nIn September 2018, the water park underwent a $2.5 million renovation including repainting the Wavepool, renovated cabanas, additional bathrooms, new beach area flooring and upgraded signage.\n\n\n== Slides ==\n\n\n=== Beginner slides ===\n\n\n=== Intermediate slides ===\n\n\n=== Advanced slides ===\n\n\n=== Extreme slides ===\n\n\n=== Decommissioned slides ===\n\n\n=== Additional attractions ===\n\n\n=== Other information ===\nWorld Waterpark also has two hot tubs: one double and one single.\nConcessions:\n\nBeachview Bar/Snacks\nPi\u00f1a Colada Bar\nCoconut Grove\nCoca-Cola Freestyle (6 machines)\nTiki DogFormer:\n\nHot Dog HutTubes can be rented at a cost, while PFDs (lifejackets) can be borrowed for no charge at Sharky's Supply Shack.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalaxyland\nWild Rapids Waterslides\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n1997 World Waterpark commercial",

          "ok, I went once and it was a blast! But I was only 24 years old. I suppose it could be fun, but watch out for vomit, floating brown things, etc. The slides are fun, Being in water is always a pleasure. Noise, not so much.",
          "This place is always an adventure and worth the drive from Calgary. The entrance fee is quite expensive (I recommend buying them online, you save 5$ each) but totally worth it in my opinion. The slides are all quite different.

          "I love West Edmonton water park! It\u2019s a lot of fun for all ages. Only negative is that when you come at a busy time you will be waiting in line for slides for a longgg time. Other than that everything is relatively clean and staff are professional.",

          "We spent an afternoon at the waterpark. It was fun and the Wavepool was great. I found it a bit disturbing that you pay that much and still have to pay for the lockers. Also the changing rooms seemed not too clean. The pool itself was. The slides are great and wait times were",
          "First off, it is super expensive to go here BUT if you plan it ahead of time and know what you are going to be spending, it is great! We stayed the whole day, rented a cabana and made it worth the money we spent! The waterpark itself is amazing!! So many things to do for all",
          "It was fun for the whole famt. My kids really enjoyed the slides and wave pool. The place was relatively clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. The only thing of concern is that in the wave pool the tubes can be a problem. My daughter got knocked over by some teens that",
          "Excellent place to bring kids and fun for the adults too! Our second visit to Edmonton to specifically go to the Waterpark.",
          "The mall is ver very big lots of stores amd the parks inside are just wonderful but you need more than a day to see it all.wewalked and walked never tthoight it would end. But lots of fun",
          "Wonderful area to entertain the children. Similar to a carnival. The pool is great, does have waves but a shallow area is available for the younger ones.",
          "The waterpark is in the shopping mall. We were staying at the Fantasyland hotel so we were able to purchase reduced priced tickets, otherwise it would have been quite expensive. We were a bit shocked that you had to pay for the lockers, it was $8 for a medium sized or $12 for a",
          "We had a good time and were really glad we showed up early so we got to enjoy the slides before the line ups started. Renting towels is a joke, if travelling you would be further ahead to pick up cheap towels at Walmart that would absorb more.",
          "We were in the mall passing a rainy day. This is a full sized water park with great slides, a wave pool and zip lines. A great way to pass a rainy day of a cold day in the winter.",
          "This is THE best indoor water park in North America. It is huge and the lines generally move quickly. You could spend an entire day here and still want to go on more slides. They have a few little kid ones so it\u2019s suitable for toddlers as well as adults and teens. This is a must",
          "The rides here are great but you spend a LOT of time waiting to go on them. The family changeroom, especially the washrooms, were pretty gross and I kept smelling urine here and there around the park. It was very busy and hard to monitor but maybe more monitoring is needed.",
          "Warmest place at Edmonton is located in West Edmonton Mall. There are slides and a large wave pool. Neat, organized, and peaceful place.",
          "As expected there was quite a big crowd however there are enough slides and activities that you can always find something to do. The only reason I gave it a three out of five is because you are allowed to bring the tubes into the wave pool and I find that quite dangerous, when",
          "good clean place, entrance fee does not include every activity, pay extra for some activity, free non alcohol drinks. At time too crowded in the water and seating area. best slides. very fun place for kids and teens",
          "Some of the best slides I\u2019ve ever encountered. You get some serious speed when you\u2019re not expecting it. If a sign says \u201cextreme,\u201d believe it.",
          "Grandchildren went here and they totally loved it, the wave pool was awesome, the slides were exciting, the locker was cheap for an all day pass only $8, they could get eats/drinks and prices were good. Would come again",
          "The water park was the most fun place in compare to other water parks that we have gone so far. There are several different slides rated based on the difficulty and scariness. There is a zip line that goes over the pool. Most fun part was also playing in the wave pool. There are",
          "We have three children ages 1, 4 and 11 that we took to West Edmonton Mall to the water park. It was an amazing experience and we had tons of fun. The only thing is that it cost a lot to get in per person plus it cost extra for things that you need like lockers, tubes and they",
          "Saw the attraction from the viewing window, but not too impressed. $45 for a water park with a few water slides is a bit much.",
          "We live in Edmonton - had not visited the waterpark for some time but teen niece and nephew were in town so took them and my son (18,16, and 14 years old). EVERYONE had a blast - lots of variety in the water slides - lots of fun to be had even if you are not a super thrill",
          "We got discount tickets at Comfort Inn, but there were also better discount tickets available at CFB Edmonton. This was a very fun outing for our 10-yr old, who enjoyed the massive wave pool and 3 of the intermediate/advanced slides. Go right at opening and there are no lines",
          "The waterpark is good family fun for all from Little\u2019s to some adults. There are a couple of extreme slides that are really fun! Spent 2 hours there and we were able to do all the slides. A family with younger kids could definitely spend a day there and be entertained.",
          "Just plain fun for kids of all ages. great variety of slides ranging from small children to adults only.",
          "Huge waterpark with lots of rides for the novice to the brave. So many good memories. Lots of experiences to be found including some lazy rivers. Have fun.",
          "This was a lot of fun for my child and I. The height restriction of 48 inches really only affected about a handful of slides. The wave pool was lots of fun but it can get crowded and you have to stay alert during the waves as some people get tossed off tubes. I stayed close to",
          "Really enjoyed it spent whole day. Still would have enjoyed more of I had the courage to dare some tough rides. Good not best and surprisingly cheese pizza chicken fingers and fries were finished at one shop.",
          "The whole family loves the waterpark. We have gone for years and at every age it is a favourite. It is well set up and well maintained. There is something to please everyone. I feel safe letting the kids roam free.",
          "I\u2019ve been the the WEM Waterpark dozens of times but this visit in particular I noticed how dated the park is getting. The pool tiles are warn were people walk and the water slides are water mineral staind. Our visit was still a lot of fun but for the price I\u2019m just surprised",
          "Wow the roller coaster water slide is spectacular. You can easily have fun here for a complete day. And also nice jacuzzi to relax in between.",
          "I went here with my class on the last day o school it was so much fun some of my friends were nervous but ended up loving it.",
          "We went to the WEM for a family gathering, deciding on the World Waterpark as one of the activities we would do. We were not disappointed. There were water slides for all ages/level of courage. My 5 yr. old grand-daughter squealed with glee with the horn went for the wave",
          "Took our son here for his 1st and his 2nd birthday. We have a lot of fun on the splash pad and the spray park. He loved the big water slide he could slide down on with us. We plan to make it a yearly tradition with him. It\u2019s a nice touch that they added access to free pop,",
          "Had my sons 23th birthday here and it was great for all ages! We rented a cabana for $60 instead of lockers. The wave pool is awesome and I suggest going early to avoid a crowd. Had a great time!",
          "Just had the most amazing time at the water park even just going on our own without children. Spent the whole day of fun -- the price was worth it as this is more then just swimming! There are slides, waves etc It is easy to spend all day or even half a day there as the water",
          "Had a blast! Lots of selection and fun rides to go on with safety being a high priority. Lots of upgrades since hubby last visited. Did all the slides and zip lines! Well worth it! Highly recommend getting splash cash and going early.",
          "My family really enjoyed the time we spent in the waterpark. The changing room was clean and has an automated machine that you can load money into your wrist band that you can use in the park without carrying cash. Otherwise, you are allowed to bring your personal items without",
          "Lots to do here and the kids really enjoyed it. My kids are a bit older and it was easy to drop them off for a few hours and go shopping while they had fun and got worn out! I do recommend you check to see if there are any schools attending the park when you are there. We were",
          "Brought my daughter here for a trip and she had to do all the mall has to offer. This is a full size waterpark located in the mall. Went to the waterpark while my wife did some shopping, uninterrupted. This place is a great idea for families who don't all want to go shopping.",
          "Well what do you say if you have never gone to a Mall with just expectations of a cheap deal.Ok lets start with tired feet...put them up at the beach bar and chill with a vino and watch the folks swim ,sunbath ,trip wide or plunge down the water shoot,,,aaah seriously !!!forget",
          "My son, who has a brain tumor was invited to participate in this amazing day. We arrived and were shown to private cabanas to change into our swimsuits. We enjoyed the waves, hot tub and a few water slides before having a private luncheon with pizza, mini hot dogs, veggies &",
          "We throughly enjoyed the park. The water slides were fantastic, something for everyone. The teenagers did the flow rider and loved it. This park was very clean, all the staff were very friendly and helpful. We went early on in the week there were no line ups or crowds. Fantastic",
          "Very fun if u enjoy waterslides. Also the wave pool is awsome..there is a area for little children. There are tubes and other stuff to rent.It is a very clean and safe place.friendly staff.",
          "My 2 friends and I went to the World water park after we haven't been back in a while. We had Discount coupons but a family Discount coupon would be nice as another Reviewer said. My 2 friends and I loved the Slideboarding game as we take a fun board down the slide. They have",
          "We went during toddler time on Thursday ($20 for a child and chaperone). We also picked up the value pass as we went as a family. It was expensive for the whole family given the amount of time we spent there and my son could only do 2 of the bigger slides. (One of the other",
          "The cost of this waterpark is insane! Not only does it cost well over $200 for a family of 5 but there is no family pass options! And lockers are an additional $8 or $12 depending on the size of locker. THEY NEED TO HAVE A FAMILY PASS option! So not affordable for most families.",
          "This is an amazing place for kids to let off steam. The view is fab, will recommend to families travelling with kids.",
          "Our kids loved this park. There are slides for the little ones and you can easily spend a day here. A bit on the privy side so do your research before you go.",
          "Trey cam from long drive I came from Merritt BC and it was pretty cold on the way and I was staying Edmonton so one day I went for a little shopping and the same time event for this water park it is pretty nice place especially in the Edmonton in the indoor perfect",
          "Great staff, very friendly management, most certainly the best pool in edmonton for an awesome time for adults and kids alike! Love it! \u2764 Also, the surf simulator is the most fun you will have in any pool. So much fun!!!",
          "We had a wonderful time as a family of four this last weekend. Really happy to have had tons of options for things to do within the park and splash cash was such a convenience. Loved the zip lines as well.",
          "While this is definitely a decent time for a family, the cost is over the top! Some slides aren't always open in the back for the tube runs and the hot tubs are over full. The wave pool needs to be repainted and it's kinda gross to look at from the slides above. It seems like",
          "I love the water park it\u2019s fantastic for kids and adults. Your kids will sleep for days. Play park for the kids and rides for adults and teenagers that will make them realize entertainment is for all ages. Everyone will have a smile.",
          "Went to west Edmonton mall with the kids for a weekend and spent a day at the waterpark. Lots of fun for the young ones and older ones and the adults. They just need to put more people in the hot tub, always a big line up.",
          "I had a great time here with my preteen. It is cheaper to arrive 3 hours prior to close, if you are not sure you want to spend all day here that is a good option. The locker system they have is awesome. You get a wristband (and can get more than one for a locker if you want to",
          "Its such a big indoor water park you can spend hours there. As its inside you dont have to worry about being to hot or cold its perfect. There are so many slides and tubes to go on as well as the zip line over the pool ( you do need to pay extra for ) If you have a spare day in",
          "I love the waterpark. It's one of my favorite things to do in Edmonton. However I don't think the big tubes should be allowed in the wavepool. I got hit In the back of my neck with one carrying a large teenager and 2 days later my neck is still really sore.",
          "I absolutely love this waterpark. I try to stop by every time I\u2019m in Edmonton. I went with the whole family last time (from toddlers to young adults) and we all had so much fun! They\u2019ve got so many slides (and lines were not too long considering it was Christmas holidays). Also,",
          "This place has a great variety of slides. It would be very easy to bring children of all ages here, and easily find a slide for them to enjoy. Tubes cost $6 extra, towels $3 refundable deposit, and a day pass just for the part if $45. Prepare for lots of climbing stairs.",
          "Great experience. Food line ups did not take long at all. However it would be more ideal if they had color coated the stairs or made signs to match the watersildes as apposed to just naming them. Would have made things a little easier.",
          "I could not believe how clean the change rooms were kept. Fantastic. Wish the concession had more options (fries??) and that one bracelet covered all payments (in the gate, splash cash and locker) but otherwise well run.",
          "We were so disappointed to arrive and find 5 children's areas closed. All that was open for the little ones was the giant wave pool and a tiny little slide area. The beautiful treehouse water play area, right at the front where they could see it first, was closed. Along with the",
          "Visited in February with two kids ages 4 and 2.5. We went in a Saturday morning. Arrived 10 minutes early to beat the line and the line was already over 100 people long. It took a while to get through the line and then the locker rooms were utter insanity as there were a lot of",
          "Everytime we have visitors, there is usually a trip to \"WestEd\", and often to the waterpark. Although the prices have risen and there don't seem to be as many discounts as in past years, if you go for the last 3 hours of the day you can still make it more affordable for a",
          "Wave pool is very cool, but slides have too many stairs for access. Overall a nice experience...can even get a suntan in the winter as there is a glass roof. Nice and warm inside.",
          "Very spacious, doesn't feel overcrowded even with a lot of visitors. Friendly staff, free sodas (Coca-Cola Freestyle), quite affordable cabana rentals for some additional comfort. The only thing I would recommend to the manager is to make cabana rentals more friendly, as now you",
          "Great fun. Lots to do. Seems pricey but we stayed there for 4 hours. Extras were fun too. My daughter did the surfing one. I like the new add money to a band feature. Saves you from carrying money around.",
          "Slides were great according to my 16 year old and his friend. Free pop was fantastic and the wrist band system for lockers and money is a genius idea. Good time for sure, so much that he went twice in one week!",
          "My family with kids ages 8 and 10 visited here Thursday before Easter. We had a great time. It gets busy after lunch so if your schedule allows, definitely arrive before the park opens so you can be first on the slides. After lunch, the waits were long. I\u2019m sure this had to do",
          "We do love going to the Waterpark. It is expensve, but you can get tickets from the Alberta Motor Association at a slight discount. The kids love the slides and the wavepool is fun for everyone",
          "Way overpriced seeing as they charge people $20 just to enter without swimming. Everything is fun though and there are some pretty cool water slides that are definitely for thrill seekers. You can also come and go as you please all day. Just plan on spending a lot of money,",
          "Was a great place but very expensive. I didn\u2019t like that we are not allowed to bring our own food in there some people just can\u2019t afford to buy their inflated food prices",
          "The water park is great. Nice and clean and the lifeguards seem to be on the ball. The price was appalling. 150.00 for for 3 of us is absurd.",
          "Day pass with family ... Including toddler and teen. Waterslides and wave pool are fun !! Great place to allow the kids to blow off energy.",
          "Visited here with a 9 year old and a 3 year old and it was great! There's something for every age group and level of bravery.....there are slides for toddlers up to the bravest adult. The wave pool is also so much fun. And so was the very large splash zone for kids. I like how",
          "We visited the water park for our first time as a family. Our 3 and 5 year old had so much fun we couldn\u2019t drag them out of there. I wasn\u2019t sure they would be old enough to enjoy enough of what\u2019s offered there but there is so much for their age and also so much to look foreward",
          "There might be a line to get in but once inside you do not notice the crowd. However the locker system is a slight bit confusing and there's no choice of which locker you'll get. Other than that this is a great place for the young or the young-hearted. Expect a day full of",
          "Drove to Edmonton just to go to the water park with two young kids in tow. Decided to visit in a Friday as I\u2019d heard it could become very overcrowded on a weekend. While the crowds were manageable, what I just couldn\u2019t get over was how dirty and rundown the entire facility",
          "It's good for family and kids in the cold winter, but not very exciting for regular couples who just want to get away from the cold Edmonton winter..... The water is colder than the regular community rec center, it's quite noisy in side, the beach chair is not as comfortable as",
          "Almost everything that you would expect to have in a waterpark, with the advantage of being indoor for some fun time even in the harsh winter of Edmonton! Usually gets very packed on weekends, so if you are someone who doesn't like the crowd plan a visit during week.",
          "The water park is always a fun place to visit with the kids. Lots to do, lots to see, and 30 deg when it\u2019s -40 outside doesn\u2019t hurt either! The only downsides are price and maintenance. It\u2019s quite expensive and the place could use a coat of paint. Oh well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be",
          "This is a great place to take the kids. It\u2019s great for special events or when family comes to town. The are options for everyone from young to old.",
          "While the water park has always been expensive, it's now a ripoff! They're now charging based on height. 48\" and over $47.25 and under 48\" $36.75. What they don't tell you is all but one of the larger slides (corkscrew) is restricted to 48\" and over. So slides that my 5 year old",
          "This water park has everything. So many water slides, even scary ones, many not so high, slides for tubing, lazy river. The pool area is pretty with a rubbery floor for the slow graded beach looking bottom. The wave poll is very good with a sound to let you know that it will",
          "Took four grandchildren. Ages 7 to 13. We ALL had a BALL. There is something for everyone to get excited about. To challenge their risk taking and still be safe. If your your lucky its not too crowded but its always enjoyable.",
          "It was my first time here though my husband has been many times before. We had a good time on the slides and in the wave pool. We did find it warm/humid in the water park and had to leave after a few hours as we were exhausted. We will be back with our kids though! They\u2019d love",
          "As a family of 14, (6 adults, 4 tweens and 4 children) we spent 6 days at WEM. The waterpark was by far the most fun. Went 3 different days and loved it.",
          "The water park was alot of fun and would be for any age. The wave pool was great, but a bit crowded and if you want a tube it's only by renting one. The layout of the slides is confusing at first but once you figure them out not bad. They had a couple slides down for maintance",
          "Took our 3 kids (9,6 and 3) for the day and were surprised at how great this waterpark was. Incredible that it is all indoors. Lots of different rides to enjoy, all of which worked well, and the wave pool was great. Worth noting, not sure if it was just the day we were there",
          "If you like waterparks and being terrified I would recommend it. If you are travelling with kids especially ones who arent strong swimmers or those who cant be left alone - don't bother wasting your time. The rides are great and almost all were open when we went there; which was",
          "Visited the WEM when the outside temperature was below minus 26 degrees The water park is still alive and well with visitors enjoying the sites and sounds of wave pools and water slides",
          "Top quality water slides, amazing wave pool. Food is a bit expensive and \u201ccheap\u201d so I\u2019d leave to eat in mall and come back. My friends were unable to come wth so I went alone and still had s blast my self. Easy can spend 6-8 hours there.",
          "Great place to shop water slid and other activity's for family fun great for winter if you can't swim outside if you love to shop lot's of stores restaurants also show's with seals great motel rooms clean and friendly",
          "Had a blast with two teenagers. From mild to wild! Food is not the greatest and expensive but otherwise a great day.",
          "I'll start off by saying this is an expensive way to enjoy an afternoon with your partner or kids. At nearly $50 per adult admission they then charge upwards of $10 for a family locker which is still not big enough. The good thing is the waterslides are fun, but LOTS of stairs.",
          "A wonderful break from the Canadian weather in a tropical environment.Great place for family fun.Cabanas are well worth the extra money and food and drinks are delivered.Plan to spent more time than you figured and bring the camera for awesome photo ops.",
          "We had a large family go and it was alot of fun. It was a great overall experience and looking forward to planning it again.",
          "Spent a few hours here using a free admission from airmiles. It was great, kids loved the waves the best.",
          "Everyone had a great time the water was fresh and clean and the overall experience topped off a very special Christmas holiday for our family.",
          "Loved the slides, my 11 year old loved the wave pool and most of the slides. The slideboarding is the only thing not worth carrying a board up for the ride. Could use colour coded railings because we kept getting lost.",
          "We live close to West Edmonton Mall. My Family has grown up with the waterpark. Great place for a birthday party. Just make sure all kids you invite to the party can swim. It's worth the money to escape the cold and the kids love it.",
          "What a great way to escape winter!! I love this water park, the wave pool is fantastic!! It\u2019s so nice and warm, you can completely forget how cold I\ufe0ft us outside. They could use a couple more hot tubs though, there were people waiting in line to get into the hot tubs, and",
          "This was our first time to the water park in about 5 years. There are some really neat new slides. We were very disappointed that the tube ride at the back of the Pool is gone however. A few of the slides are getting a bit old and are a bit painful to ride, as the scrape your",
          "A must place for your family to go. A bit pricey, but you have access for the entire day and evening. Food stand and bar available if you need it. Water slides are awesome and the wave pool is immense. Loungers and tables available to relax or gather with your family. Get",

          "We went for the New Year\u2019s Eve beach ball had good fun. There seemed to not be enough Buffet tickets for those who wanted them. Lines for the hot tubs were around 20 minutes, and slides were about the same. The wave pool appears dirty and aged. It also causes mass waves of",

          "We did not access the waterpark but did stop to watch the families enjoying themselves. It's a huge area with continuous huge wave movement and a LOT of stairs to climb to access the slides. Family fun for sure!!!",
          "My entire Family spent the day here and we loved the Grandkids enjoyed the kid slides and little water park and my kids could have stayed there for ever on all the other waterslides",
          "Went with my 1 and 6 year old daughters, felt safe and secure. Kids area was fun. Lounge chairs get \"claimed\" pretty early on. We got a private cabana, should have started with that, well worth it.",
          "This place is unreal. Me and my wife had such a good time in the Wave pool. She normally doesnt like swimming but I couldnt get her out of that Wave Pool if i wanted to. Cant wait to return.",
          "The place is pretty expensive if you buy at full price, check Kijiji for people selling off tickets. Not sure why they play music in the place, you can't hear it over all the other noise and it just makes the noise worse. The line-ups for the slides can get pretty long but I",
          "I\u2019m from the East coast and was craving some waterslides. This place is just OK. We are far from Village Vacances Val Cartier in Quebec city. BUT, it works ok. You get bored pretty quick, we were lucky it was a pretty quiet day so we haven\u2019t waited much for slides. The wave pool",
          "Our family enjoys the waterpark. It\u2019s costly to go, but we use Airmiles passes. Re-entry lockers are available but expensive. Can rent tubes and life jackets. Food options are minimal and costly. Free pop available at Coke machine behind the main bar. Water slides are fun and",
          "Some may call this place expensive, but I think it is worth the money you pay, my buddies and I head down here at least once a year to ride the slides and we are never disappointed...with all the mall has to offer, you and your friends or family will have an awesome time.",
          "Staying at Fantasyland Hotel so it was a short hot skip and a jump to the water park. Not too crowded for a Sunday. Was nice to float around in wavepool, watch the surfers and soak in hot tub. Nice relaxing day. Have an extended pass so our party can come and go as we would like.",
          "We hit a very busy day,so it wasn't very enjoyable. It was crowded in the water. It was very slow getting into the water park. The lineups were to long. The water was a good temperature if you could find some without getting bumped.it was noisey. I would give it another try",
          "Perfect place to bring bored teenagers. They have so much fun all the time. You can bring babies. If you do not want to come in they have a watching area for parents who do not want to pay the entrance fee but would like to check on their kids once in awhile.",

          "Had a great time here with our 4 year old daughter. There is something to do here for all ages. Worth every penny. I recommend this place to anyone with small children. I would only wish that they would have a few more food choices. Free drinks Ina plus though",
          "What a fabulous place, extremely clean and everything appears to be very well maintained. The water slides are incredibly fast and line ups on a Sunday afternoon aren't even bad. Wave pool is huge but be careful for floating people - you may get hit, ouch! Its about $45 to get",
          "Worth a full day of fun, lots to do for all ages and make sure to call ahead of time to find out which slides are closed. Has been a lot of fun for us and the kids enjoy going there during the summer.",
          "I LOVED it! It's not peak season so the park is not packed like sardines. There are no lines for slides and the wave pool wasn't littered with people back to back trying to ride the waves so I couldn't crash into people. Loved it!",
          "We decided to take a day trip to Edmonton from Calgary to go to the Waterpark. I hadn't been in years, and my kids had never been. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and we all had things we could do there. My kids' ages are 18, 15 & 13, so it worked for all of us. One thing that has",

          "The water park at west Edmonton mall, although pricey, is worth it. There is something for everyone at the park. Plan a whole day at the park to get your money's worth. No need to leave as everything you need for the day is contained in the park from food, to a place to sit and",
          "I had not been to the World Water Park for a number of years and was very impressed. Last we had visited the park was getting outdated and showing wear. I was happily surprised by the number of upgrades and renovations. The wave lake is still the focal point and provides",

          "Our family had a great time at this attraction. From slower less crazy slides to thrilling slides this place has it all. The wave pool was my kids favorite. You could be in the deeper area with crashing waves or in the shallow area with smaller swells. The zip line was a great",
          "We spent an afternoon playing with the waves and we had so much fun! The slides and zip lining was fun too! We'll be back!",

          "It is hugest mall to visit the place it is bussesnes place on earth To crowd to go there thanks again",
          "Different colors indicate different levels of the slides. They changed the speed slide into a surfing pool plus a view area. A kids' area, a baby pool, a hot tub and a zip line zone. My kids love the wave pool the most. With a day pass, in-and-out unlimited. Never be enough",
          "This is always a great place to come if your are around WEM. Wave pool is fun but if you have issues with heights be warned that the slides may be heart stopping! :)",
          "My kids have winter attraction passes and go weekly in the winter months.Great water slides , good for adults as well. Birthday party picnic on the beach!!",
          "Great place to get away from the weather. Get there early, if you go on the weekend. After noon-ish the lines get longer, but even then, not too bad. We were there for 6+ hours and could have stayed longer. This visit we were all teenagers and adults. Lots of stairs:)",
          "Great area for small kids though the combo of spraying water and climbing stairs was a little too intense for our 3.5 year old in the one area there were lots of slides for her age group. Love that they have free life jackets and swim diapers. Change rooms a bit small, lockers",
          "The entrance is odd (it's underground), but once you're in you can honestly spend an entire day there. Just make sure to pack enough clothes and snacks.",

          "We booked the fall into fantasy package and received 4 tickets to the waterpark. Was lots of fun. They seem to change the slides out once in a while to keep the park fresh. The slide boarding slide was fun. The tube ride behind the wave pool is fun too but they removed the twin",
          "How cool is this.... a water park inside a mall.... Pretty amazing! Great space as well as not very crowded. LOTS OF WAVES!",
          "Basically, this waterpark is overpriced and extremely busy. A terribly combination. I would never go here again.",
          "Tons of slides and tons of fun. Indoor waterpark year round. Lockers available for rent near washroom / change rooms.",
          "I attended the water park as a chaperone for Whitecourt Central school grade five class year end party. There were about 60 children and 12 adult chaperones. All the children were assigned an adult to report to. One of the children in my group received a hit in the nose while",
          "We take our grandkids here every time they visit. The waterslides are wonderful, varying from very easy all the way up. I've done all the Advanced ones and some of the Extreme. They're a blast. The kids really like the wave pool, and they've also done the surfing and zip lining.",
          "We're a family of 4 with 2 young kids and we had a blast. The whole facility is very clean and appears to be well run. You couldn't really say that about it years ago but obviously they listened to the criticism (and health department) and you can see the effort to keep the",

          "My husband and I drove from Calgary to Edmonton for the day to take our 2 year old daughter to the waterpark for the first time and we were disappointed.

          "Be ready for a good quality fun time with your family, kids, and friends. This is simply the best park ever I've been too. I highly recommend it for everyone visiting Edmonton. You don't have to be a swimmer to enjoy the park. Water waves is the best. I enjoyed the most with",
          "Spent 4 hours here on the Sunday of labour day long weekend. We got there at opening times and felt like we had the place to ourselves for a couple hours. The crowds really picked up around noon and then it wasn't as fun. The slides are very well kept and we always felt safe.",
          "Fun fun and more fun. Great rainy day experience and fun on a great day. So many water slides and love the wave pool",
          "We were fortunate enough to score a couple of two for one coupons so we headed to the waterpark. The park was busy and not an empty chair was in sight so we had to go back to the dressing room and rent a locker-super cool system! While the slides were cool for the daring 17 yr",
          "Water tubes are too dangerous, our young one was under it when a big wave came and trapped her! The slides were fun, loved the temperature of the hot tubs, beautiful facility!",
          "had a great time at the water park but the structure is showing its age. A lot of corrosion makes you question the integrity of the structure. Scaffolding around some to the slides looks pretty sketchy",
          "The water park at West Edmonton Mall is an excellent spot for small children. The splash park area is well suited for little ones. If available, try to rent one of the cabanas if you have a larger group. That way you have somewhere to store your stuff, change and have a quieter",

          "A great experience for the family. I believe the prices are too high but for a one time event it was worth it. We received a $15/ per person discount by staying at the Fantasyland Hotel. The hours should open earlier at 9am vs 11am on a Saturday we were there and that would",
          "I've been to world waterpark two or three times. Once was for a friend's birthday, once was for a dual party and once was just a visit with a friend. There is a wave pool, and a whole variety of slides. I won't go on some of the slides because they are too scary for me. I like",
          "Lots of fun for grand kids. Over priced for all options, pay $10 for a locker and pay $20 just to come in and watch and not use any facilities. Lucky the parking was free at the mall or they would charge for that as well LOL.",
          "Great place for ye family to chill and hangout on a hot day. The only thing I don't like are the redneck drink in the shed or garage bar crowd... Serving wobbly pops is bad idea. Other than that it is all good.",
          "Had so much fun in the wave pool, wasn't expecting the blue 'dump' slide to be so fast, but it was so much fun also! Awesome little play/water jungle gym at the entrance that my 4 year old loved!",

          "We went early in the morning which was great because it got really busy in the afternoon. When the wave pool is busy, it's hard to keep people (or unattended children) from running into you or landing on you. You just have to be aware. My son also did the Flowrider.(simulated",
          "A phenomenal waterpark. There are 17 slides, allowing for a full range of thrill levels. I would recommend going early, right when they open as it does get quite busy after lunch. The $8.00 locker rentals seem a bit expensive. No outside food or drinks are aloud in the pool,",
          "when you go here every other waterpark will look like a bath in comparison. Theres a ton of slides and stuff, and even if like me you don't know how to swim theres a few slides which don't require swimming and you'll have fun in the wave pool and hot tub. Theres also slides for",
          "The park is as always a great indoor water park for the kids. For an attraction this is pretty good. They need way way better seating and a lot more of it. Get rid of the viewing balcony (which is creepy) and get more chairs! I agree with every other reviewer. The music garble",
          "Gets more crowded as the day goes on so maximize the rides when it's not busy and ride the waves when you need a break from lining up. As first timers we didn't really know what was going on but we caught on and staff were very friendly and wanted to help you have a good time.",
          "We visit at least twice or more a year. Always to this main attraction, the waterpark! Each year it seems to get worse. The cleanliness has gone way down, there was plastic and hair floating all over in the wave pool.very gross! The pool floor is in desparate need of",

          "If you enjoy water, this is a place to be. Indoor water park but heated like tropical setting. Can be quite crowded on weekend. A family of 5 could spend more than $200 dollars depending on the age of kids. Unlimited soda included in the admission. Discounted entry fee when you",
          "We did have fun but there were negatives. Everything looked basically the same when we came 7 years ago and at that price point, you would think something would change. The slides were for the most part in good shape no cutting or scrapes. They advertise strictly only bathing",
          "This great water park is inside West Edmonton Mall, Largest Mall of North America. Plenty of slides and fun activity for all ages. All slides are marked properly between Easy to Extreme and Height, weight needed to enjoy them. Crew is friendly. There are some slides which need",

          "I'm a seaside person and so are my kids, however, since Edmonton got no shores except lakes, I have this place a try, I'm sure the water slides are fun, and the activities are cool but the artificial beach, please take it out and do any other rides or fun activities better than",
          "We had a great time today at the WEM world water park. We rented a cabana, which was well worth the money. I highly recommend it if you are coming with a large group of people or even just a bigger family. You have your own space to chill when needed or a spot to touch base at.",
          "A great choice to being our preteen grandchildren to. Even though there are alot of guests, the whole waterpark did not feel crowded either in or out of the water. The kids loved all the waterslides! The locker system works wonderfully to come and go as you like. The",

          "Overall, the waterpark is a lot of fun. We bought the 2-day Multi-Play pass and saw a lot of WEM's attractions besides just the park. Two comments, though: 1. There is a ride called the Slide Board, where you ride a board down the slide and press buttons on the board in time",

          "Bridge is awesome, river is low, great weather. Great pictures. Awesome time",
          "Excellent dog park. Tons of off leash area for the dogs to run. Great parking. Only draw back is the river has quite a current when it's high. Afraid for my dog if he were to run into it.",

          "Very nice and huge off leash  park. Many dogs loose and most are socialised.",

          "ALWAYS a pleasure taking my doggy-grandson  here. Lots of space to dilly-daddle, explore and RUN!",
          "The bike trails are challenging and fun. Not too much traffic and meeting other like minded mountain  bikers is great",
          "So much space, so many puppies.  And with the fresh green of spring, a pleasant place to go for a walk. Remember,  no smoking in the parks is allowed. Hate to lo6this place to a fire caused by some ID 10T",

          "It's awesome to just pull up and let your dog out of the vehicle, lots of places and trails to walk and bike ride. Wear appropriate footwear as the paths are not maintained. I don't go on the weekends though as I hear it's just full of dogs and some can be aggressive.",
          "Nice area.  Could use more parking.  Lots of trails for biking.  If you are using the off leash dog park the river is north of the parking lot.  Be warned if your dog likes to swim, I always hear people say oh I guess my dog is wet now. . .",
          "Nice big loop for walking around the ravine, always nice and clean. Late upgrades. Could use some more benches around, would be great.",

          "Great open space with trails and places for dogs to swim off leash. Bring mosquito repellent.",
          "The offleash park itself is great, but my one complaint would be from other dog owners who go through the effort of picking up after their dog, and then discarding the plastic bag alongside the trails. You're better off not picking it up at all, as their waste will deteriorate much faster than a plastic bag.",

          "Always down here with my puppy!! Only 4 stars because they need to develop it better with actual bathrooms. Lots of events happen down there. Maybe even a doggy wash spot. Paved parking lot wouldn\u2019t be bad either. Gets muddy during wet season. Lots of open space for the dogs to run around and 99% friendly people.",
          "Horribly rutted road.  Overgrown quack grass around the public art and (of course) loaded with dogs ... many of which were poorly trained and jumped up on any and everyone.  On a positive note:. The portal potties were clean and well supplied.",
          "The best off leash area in the city. Make sure your dog has good recall because this park is huge, full of trees, tall grass and a lot of wildlife.

          "Great to take walk unthink stuff away just take it all in and relax",

          "AMAZING \n\nHuge park....first time here and spent 2 days at 3 hours a day and we still didn't see all of it. Lots of friendly people....very few land mines around....people really do pick up after their dogs here...good for you Edmonton. You guys have a real natures gem in the city.",
          "Great place to bring the furry ones. Scenic, spacious, lots of fellow dog lovers",
          "I went for a great walk with a friend at the park. We went the opposite direction of where the main dog part is. I really like the new bridges that they built which allows you to get to other parks.",
          "This is one of the (possibly THE) best off-leash parks in Edmonton.\nThe challenge in the summer, however, comes from the fact that it is also a popular park for people who like to cycle the trails. Most cyclists interact well with others (a \u2026",

          "Biked over to the expansive dog park on a sunny Sunday. Seemed to be a very popular spot for people and pups alike. I enjoyed the few food trucks who though to set up shop in the parking lot, a perfect spot to grab an ice cream cone.",
          "Huge off leash dog park with wide open fields, natural trails and access to the river. There is lots of parking, but it gets busy when the weather is nice, especially on weekends. The parking lot gets really bad pot holes in the spring and the park gets pretty flooded from the melting snow.",
          "Best place to ride with little kids.",

          "Love it here, great hike and pups always have a great time",
          "Off-leash. Not fenced. Good for dogs swimming in the river. Good for walking trails (they are on Google maps if you zoom in). I find the best place to get our dog playing with other dogs is by the water.",
          "Always a great experience rain or shine. Perfect backdrop for photo shoots, working out or walking your pups. Located obviously in the southwest near Terwillegar which in my opinion is one of the most desirable zones in Edmonton. Definitely a must to check out!",

          "It is a good place for your pet dogs.",
          "Terwilligar is our fave dog park to visit in the city. This time the water was really high and fast, so we couldn't go in with the kids or dogs; but it's usually lovely when the water is lower. I think the city could do a better job by installing toilets and sinks and a fresh source of drinking water. Otherwise, it's great!",

        "wiki": "The University of Alberta Botanic Garden (formerly the Devonian Botanic Garden) is Alberta's largest botanical garden. It was established in 1959 by the University of Alberta. It is located approximately 3.1 km (1.9 mi) west of the City of Edmonton, Alberta and 5.9 km (3.7 mi) north of the town of Devon, Alberta in Parkland County.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe garden was created in 1959 and established on donated land.The garden was originally designated the \"Botanic Garden and Field Laboratory\" of the department of botany at the U of A. In the 1970s, after the garden was severely damaged by floods, a donation from the Devonian Foundation, along with funds raised by the Friends of the Garden, helped to repair the damages, create a system of canals and ponds, construct a headquarters building, and purchase more land. In recognition of the donation, the name was changed to the Devonian Botanic Garden.\nThe Friends of the Devonian Botanic Garden was founded in 1971 as a fundraising group to support the aims and objectives of the garden.\nIn conjunction with an enhanced memorandum of understanding signed between the Aga Khan University and the University of Alberta in 2009, the University of Alberta requested the Aga Khan IV to develop an Islamic garden within the grounds. Planning the garden took nearly a decade and construction lasted 18 months. It was designed by the architectural firm Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects. The garden opened to the public in July 2018.Throughout the 2018 season, gardeners completed the planting of over 25,000 new perennials, trees, shrubs, and wetland plants, and add finishing touches on landscaping. The total cost of the Aga Khan Garden was $25 million. The garden is tagged as the \"most northerly Islamic garden in the world\".The botanical facility was renamed as the University of Alberta Botanic Garden in 2017. In September 2017, it invested $4.9 million to renovate its front entrance and parking lot.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe gardens extend over 30 hectares (80 acres) of 12,000-year-old sand dune shoreline of pre-glacial Lake Edmonton, and include an additional 65 hA (160 acres) of natural areas.\nIt is linked to the North Saskatchewan River via the Parkland County trail and will soon be linked to a 74 km Edmonton Capital Region river valley recreation trail system.\nHighlights of the garden include the Kurimoto Japanese Garden; a Tropical Showhouse with exotic butterflies; Temperate and Arid Showhouses; extensive alpine, herb, rose, peony, lilac, lily, and primula collections; Native Peoples Garden; trial beds, and much more. The Garden is open to visitors from May through Thanksgiving (Oct. 8), and year-round for adult and children's education programming.\nIt contains a diverse variety of plants, with emphasis on cold-hardy plants that can survive the harsh extremes of a Zone 3 climate.\nAs a unit of the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences, the garden is also a site for research, including plant conservation and diversity. A fully digitized herbarium contains a large collection of bryophyte specimens that is used for research and teaching, as well as horticultural plants grown at the garden.\nEvery June, the Edmonton Opera company plays music in the park for one day during an event dubbed  Opera al Fresco.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2013: Alberta Emerald Award, for its outdoor environmental education programs\n2014: Botanical Garden of the Year, awarded by the Canadian Garden Council.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "I remember years ago being inspired by these gardens. That is no longer the case and the massive construction project does not help. Giving 10% off admission fees is a joke... you should get 90% off as a huge part of the garden is off limits and most of the trails were closed.",
          "Went there at the end of Aug last year with my family who came from overseas. Quite disappointing as we paid full price (was over $80 for the family with rides on the golf cart as well) to see lots of dead flowers. Both my sister and Mom who are avid gardeners were looking",

          "I try to go to the gardens as much as I can. It's a fabulous walk around, so peaceful, tranquil yet exciting! What exciting you say. Yes, to see all the plants that you could grow in your Alberta yard, but have been too scared to try. If it grows at the gardens then you give it",
          "I've visited botanic and show gardens around the world and I was prepared to be disappointed at the Devonian. However, this was a well designed and interesting garden with great glass houses and very good support from their 'friends'. I've been back a couple of times now and",

          "Devonian gardens primary attraction to me is the butterfly house - small but so delightful and typically hot. The other attraction is the Japanese garden, at the right time of the year it can have a transformational quality. Otherwise the rest of the rather large slightly hilly",
          "What a gorgeous botanical treat. Full of amazing flowers, plants, sculptures, butterflies and interesting buildings. LOVED the Japanese Gardens side. Plan on spending the entire day, we only had 3 hours and it just wasn't enough.",

          "I attended on of the classes here and it did not disappoint! Great class, perfect setting and more gardens to enjoy with special highlights and features than can be taken it during a day. Ate lunch at their cafe which was tasty and a good price. Nice with a decent selection",
          "The Japanese Gardens are especially beautiful and relaxing. We went in the mid morning and it was generally a nice atmosphere until later when they started running the trolleys. Often the trolleys were coming so often it was difficult to walk on the paths without being",
          "A great place to visit flora and fauna, nice place to spend the day but lots of walking. Interesting as well.",
          "Just a Beautiful place to see and relax. The gardens themselves are very lovely and well maintained. If you have any problems walking or short on time, there is a tram ride you can take for a few bucks and is quite nice and takes about 45 minutes with narration.",
          "So many plants, flowers, trees etc. All pretty,to see & can feel if you can touch them. Visual paradise. Trip there is nice as well.",
          "Beautiful gardens. We started in the Japanese garden, and it was so peaceful. You could spend hours there just \"getting away from it all\". Definitely take your camera or phone for photos! The greenhouses were interesting, but the other gardens were beautiful and well worth",

          "Just 30 minutes west of Edmonton, the Devonian Botanic Garden is a plant lover's paradise. I visit at least once a year. This property is huge, so wear comfy walking shoes. You can also take their guided trams to learn more about the garden and save some energy! The herb garden",
          "I have been to many gardens and have enjoyed them all but this one was a cut above the rest. Take the tram and have a tour then repeat by walking the grounds and taking everything in at a slower pace. Don't miss the butterfly atrium, sure to thrill",
          "My wife decided to take us to the Devonian Gardens, neither of us had ever been. It was nice, but not more. Very relaxing, walking through the gardens, many places needed attention but the overall experience was nice. A good way to spend a couple of hours in a very calm,",

          "Lived in the Edmonton area for 30 years and finally made it to the garden. It was a beautify day (which never hurts) that was made for a great walk among the plants. Most things were blooming (except notably the lilacs) so it was an amazing day for just soaking in the",
          "This garden is located only a few miles from the airport making it a convenient stop on your way into the city. A tram tour is available as well as a snack bar. Most plants are labeled for easy identification. This is a good stop for about 1-2 hours.",
          "I went to Devonian Gardens yesterday. One of the golf carts drove by my toddler at a fast speed. The cart was about 2 feet away from him. I was walking towards him to get to him prior the cart going by. The cart didn't slow down or stop, just drove by. Nothing happened to my",
          "This place has great potential but we were disappointed. We are hobby farmers, have a vegetable and flower garden in a large treed yard. We expected to see plants and trees labeled, learn about plants that survive in Alberta. Very few plants were labeled with common names. So we",
          "We attended a wedding here and it was gorgeous! Not only did I get great ideas for creating my own butterfly garden, but the grounds were much bigger than expected complete with cafe and ponds. There were beautiful statues and plaques with stories about particular plants and",
          "This is a great place to spend a day. There is a lot of walking I would recommend you take a snack, water and sensible shoes. My only issue was breaking the serenity of the Japanese garden with lawnmowers. You would think with the hours of 10-6 in this area they could mow the",
          "If you're a student, this place is very VERY affordable - admission is 1/2 price with student ID! The gardens are spectacular and there are lots of paths that wind through this enormous garden. If you go, bring water!! they don't have potable water there and you have to",
          "Because winter is so long here, it can take a while for the plants to catch up. I would not recommend going in May as there is little in the gardens yet. I also would be wary of going in October as the frosts may have killed some of the plants. Just went in mid July and the",
          "Spent a Saturday afternoon here! The butterflies were amazing! Enjoyed the Japanese garden the most! It has beautiful ponds and waterfalls as well as a goldfish pond!",
          "The botanical gardens are always a nice relaxed no visit with the kids. They love the butterflies, maze, and tower. As well as trying to find frogs. The Japanese gardens are beautiful as is the rest of the garden. And there are many trails to explore. I went along with my",
          "This is a lovely spot to enjoy nature and get some exercise. Not many of the flowers were in bloom yet, but we enjoyed what we saw. Lovely butterfly exhibit as well. Enjoyed an afternoon snack from the canteen too.",
          "Every sense can be satisfied here. You can taste different botanics. Touch different botanics textures. Smell different types of plants to seeing a variety of beautiful botanics. There is also a good sense of peace in the air that one can hear",
          "Decided to spend a Saturday exploring the Devonian Gardens as we hadn't been there in years and we felt like getting out of the city for a few hours. With two adults and two teens we found the family admission price to be quite reasonable. The butterfly garden and Japanese",
          "This garden is affiliated with the U. of Alberta, and is several miles west of Edmonton proper. It's not necessarily a place to see lots of flowers, but more of a true arboretum. It has a large Japanese Garden which is very well done. And the other theme areas make for a nice",
          "Always a pleasure to visit! Was at the spring Japanese Festival and everything was beautiful a few weekends ago, will definitely try to visit again this year! The whole garden is quite large so make sure you have enough time to see the different gardens and greenhouses.",

          "I was very disappointed once arriving at the gardens. My mother has terminal cancer and is staying at the hospice in Stony Plain. I saw the Devonian Botanical Gardens advertisement on Facebook saying that Sunday, May 29th was Butterfly Day and figured that would be a nice",
          "It is a pleasant place for a walk, but not many things to see here. It is too far from Edmonton as well. Driving too far for too little to see - not worth it.",
          "Considering Edmonton's harsh winter climate a Garden is not something that people visiting might think of doing but the area is relaxing and offers many trails that you can meander along. On some evenings they sometimes offer events which feature live music, ethnic food, or",
          "When I was a kid, going here on Mother's Day was a bit of a tradition in our household. We hadn't done it in quite a few years, so this was the family's first time in a long time. Loved some of the newer buildings, like John's Folly, and still dug old classics like the",
          "Very scenic, beautiful gardens with trials and a cute gift shop. Food onsite is average price but the admission is too expensive considering they are funded by the govt. Neat activities for kids in the building but the long walk around the gardens will bore them. The childrens",
          "Just about 30 mins drive outside of Edmonton, this park can get really busy during the summer months with lots of wedding bookings. But it's still a very lovely park if you check out the Japanese garden. They have many plants and shrubs for fans of gardening, and a few indoor",
          "Warm spring days, are encouraging trees to start sprouting. Hopefully we get some moisture soon. The park opens for summer for visitors.",
          "Spent the daughter with my daughter at the Botanic Gardens. First time either of us had been there and we enjoyed it. It was very early in the season so nothing was in bloom, but things were starting to turn green. It was very relaxing walking through all the different",
          "This is a super-busy spot. If you're looking for a quiet garden without kids come during school hours. However, the place is peaceful no matter when you go. It has areas devoted to all sorts of different plants, moths, and butterflies. Take the longer walks and learn some",
          "In 1992 I went for a first date with the woman who is now my wife of 24 years, we went to Devonian Botanical Gardens. This is still a favourite of ours and it has become a family outing now. Beautiful grounds and an amazing butterfly garden. I have nothing but good things to say",
          "My wife and I spent a day to relax and visit the Devonian Botanic Garden. It was a beautiful day along with fantastic surroundings.",
          "Went with the grand kids and their mom for a day. Relaxing and beautiful venue. Friendly staff, lots to do and see. All in all a great place for the family.",

          "The gardens are a wonderful place to walk, wander, relax, take photographs, or just simply enjoy all of the beautiful surroundings.",
          "The Japanese Gardens and Butterfly House were my favourite part of the Garden. I can't remember the exact cost but it wasn't unreasonable. I went in the early spring and alot of it wasn't 'bloomed'. I think it would be best in the summer. Worth a visit.",
          "Great outdoor ... See all flower smell them too ....hear birds singing .....Must go to the butterfly room that is so cool ... They have nice gift shop and nice coffe shop too ,sit outside and squirrel. Come and visit you too",
          "This is a gem just west of Edmonton. Well worth the sights of some of the plants here on the prairies",
          "The Devonian Centre is often overlooked when visiting Edmonton and Surroundings. It is actually in the Town of Devon but the drive to there is more then worthwhile. It is deffinately a place to visit between May and October, not later. It is more of a nature centre and not",
          "This is an outstanding place but needs more care , more lights for indoor areas and some funds to develop it to a higher level, else, it is a place to enjoy a fun day indeed.",
          "Lots of amazing flowers. Long slow stroll through the flowers and trees. Very relaxing. Amazing setting for wedding photos depending on the flowers in bloom.",
          "We took our group of 30 to the Gardens for a summer field trip. We caught frogs, butterflies and had a fun day walking around enjoying the view. Will definitely take me kids back. It would also be a beautiful wedding venue! Cost was reasonable and staff very patient and helpful!",
          "Beautiful, vast and peaceful. The Japanese Garden is especially lovely and serene. I recommend this garden any time of the year.",
          "I took my mom to see these gardens. Her mobility is limited so for a few $ we road the golf cart tram tour of the massive gardens. The guide was very knowledgeable and stopped at each garden so we could get out and \"smell the roses\" or take photos. The various gardens have",
          "Very nice! A great place to go with kids or even just some friends. Flowers are amazing and the amount of work they must put in is crazy.",
          "Devonian Botanical Gardens is about half hour drive from Edmonton, but well worth it. It is hard to say which part of the gardens I liked best as they all had special merits. It is a very peaceful place, lovely walks through wooded area's too. Lookout for the wooden statues here",
          "Depending on what time of year, the grounds are very pretty. Different things blooming at different times allows you to visit a couple of times a year because of the changes! Do visit!",
          "This was an unexpected gem! The Japanese garden in particular was incredible and well worth the cost of admission alone. It was nice to see well-labelled plant material (better even than some of the big show gardens in BC). We were there late in the evening and slightly out of",
          "Great place to enjoy a early evening or morning walk. Beautiful flower beds, shrubs, trees, etc. Not a Butchart Gardens by any means, but kind of a training ground for botanists, etc. Could use a bit of sprucing up in some areas. Of course, they would need to charge more for",
          "Love their summer Thursday date nights! We went to the Japanese drumming event and was soooo much fun! Got to try it out ourselves too. Their restaurant is very good too - not much selection but good food and great patio,",
          "You won't be disappointed by a visit to these gardens. For the Edmonton area these are pretty amazing. Best in mid to late July. We went end of August but it was still very nice. Great way to allow your toddler to run and enjoy a picnic.",
          "A intresting and educating place to walk around in. It must also be a great place to see the different blooming seasons. And very relaxing area. Espesially good place to visite fore garden-enthusiasts.",

          "We attended a rather large wedding in these gardens. The gardens were very well put together and maintained and brought such beauty to the ceremony. The service of the park attendants was very good. They did everything they could to be of service.",
          "Located just west of Edmonton off highway 20, the road to Devon. It is an all day trip. Be sure to bring comfy shoes, a hat for hot days and a picnic lunch including drinks. I was with a school field trip. when I went to the gardens. The kids were kept busy the whole time",
          "What a lovely way to spend a day out and end with a picnic. A pleasant walk around the Japanese garden, then a ride around on the tram. Don't miss the butterfly exhibit wonderful place to sit and rest after your walk. Good food and drink available along with gifts and",

          "Great way to spend the day, walking around one wonderful garden surrounding you. Try for a week day visit",
          "You cannot plan a better place to visit on fathers day. The garden setting was breath taking. The social events for this fathers day included, honey, herbal tea, and craft beer tasting as well as a BBQ.",
          "We visited the gardens while attending a wedding in July 2015. The grounds were a little worn down by the hot and dry temperatures we experienced earlier this summer. The wedding was held in the back corner of the gardens and was such a picturesque spot. There are so many",
          "Never ever go there. We just decided to have a fun morning Saturday in a beautiful botanic garden. That's why we headed to Devonian. First of all, it's too expensive for what you will get with your visit. The garden is more like a desolate place that is not maintained and taken",
          "I recently attended the Japanese Festival at the DBG and was impressed with the variety of attractions offered. There are several gardens, exhibits and quiet areas to just sit and enjoy the surroundings. The DBG is a wonderful way to escape the madness of the city for a few",
          "This is a great place to take the grandchildren. My husband and I went there lady summer and spent 3 hours there. Had lunch also and it was so relaxing and serene.",
          "Before I visited this garden, I got told it's not worth for what my family has to pay for the entrance fee. I still went with my family to prove it to myself. It's really a disappointing visit. There were labels of plants on the ground but they do no longer exist. I suggest",
          "The garden is nice and rememner to visit the craft center for some beautiful handmade items. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 4 is because I was very disappointed is the coffee shop. We ordered two hot dogs and waited more than 20 minutes ..so finally I just asked for",
          "love the gardens ...great walk and vistas. Well managed and interesting. Lots to see. There is a butterfly garden",
          "Went to the Devonian Botanic Garden on Canada Day as part of an adult family-reunion-outing...was not disappointed. Elderly folks - please bear in mind, this place is BIG...a lot to see, but a lot of walking to see it. Thankfully, they have little trams to take people on",
          "This is definitely one of the better day trip places in Edmonton (and area). It's 240 acres of beautiful flowers and neat ecosystems. There is a marsh area, so don't forget the bug spray, but it has a beautiful walking deck through it and the frogs and marsh plants are very cool",
          "One of our favourite places to go with our kids (and I know it's not for everyone). But we go here every summer, pack a picnic, enjoy the Japanese gardens, smell the fresh air, and partake in any interesting events they have going on. Been here twice for Canada Day and it's",
          "This place is huge and beautiful. It's well maintained and very accessible. We saw 5 weddings there, on the day we went, and it is great for photo ops. There is a sensory garden where you can taste and touch and smell all sorts of delights. It is very educational. The cafe is",

          "After the bustle of Edmonton it was a treat to relax at the gardens. It was pleasant to walk beside the water on such a hot day. And the flowered were beautiful. It was fun to see flowers blooming that are finished at home. The Japanese Garden is just lovely.",
          "I was kind of expecting a smaller, more intense garden like the Public Gardens in Halifax. This is way more spread out, but still very nice. Almost more park-like than garden-like. There is a quiet calmness to the gardens that is very refreshing. I was with my family and",
          "I had heard great things about the garden but we were somewhat disappointed because we were expecting to see luscious green flowery gardens but it was not the case. Was it due to a particularly dry season and/or lack of funds? Nevertheless, I would recommend it as I think that",
          "Visited May 3 2015 - it was my first time. A short drive from Edmonton and we were not dissapointed. A beautiful place with calming water features and lots of unique trees, plant arrangement mixed with Japanese culture. We attended Japanese tea as well which was very worth while",
          "The Japanese and Alpine gardens were very beautiful. The maze would be fun for kids. The boardwalk was good for watching birds. The rest makes a nice walk, but nothing too notable as many of the flowers were finished for the year.",
          "If you like flowers and just having sometime to smell the roses you will love this place. You can walk for what seems like for miles in a very tranquil setting. The Japanese Garden is my favorite. It is so peaceful and calming you don't want to leave. Take sometime out of your",
          "Beautiful gardens to stroll in, plenty to see and explore, so well maintained and just a few minutes from the city limits, knowledgeable staff, worth spending a day there, nice Cafe, the butterfly house is interesting as is the cactus green house. Walking trails that meander",
          "We were able to complete our tour riding for an additional $5.00 each. Well worth it. Staff were very friendly and knowledgable about the various sections of the garden. It might be better to view the garden closer to summer when more plants would be in bloom.",

          "Gardens to stroll in, a Japanese Garden to meditate in, art classes, craft classes, Japanese festivals and many other offerings. Great place to let the kids run off their energy, but they also offer guided tram tours for those who may be less mobile.",
          "This is a great place to spend an afternoon as the gardens are quite unique. They have a wonderful Japanese section which we really like it is a quiet place to sit and just take in the History tranquility that the gardens are well known for.",
          "There is often fun programming at this venue - concerts and whatnot, so look ahead to see if there is something that interests you, otherwise it may be a bit of a long way to go to look at plants.",

          "This is one of the places that you enjoy when you go there for the first time but after that you feel like a waste of time. There are many things to discover and it is good to spend a full day to walk everywhere.",
          "If you are looking for a well run Botanical garden with a vast walking area and many varieties of flora and a beautiful Japanese garden this is for you.",
          "LUMINARIA had such potential and was a total disappointment. Literally thousands of cars were lined up to enter, told to return to Devon to park and then the long cold outdoor wait began for a shuttle. For what? Hundreds of candles lit crowded paths - but to what and to where?",
          "The Devoni=an Garden is a miracle...too bad more people don't know about it. I love the visual beauty, the aromas, the get-away-from-it-allness of it. In the stunning Japanese formal garden, I became to peaceful and contemplative that it was only as I was leaving that I",
          "They have so much classes ,strolling thru all the pathways ,nature , culture and even for the winter the Lumina(sp?) at the Japanese gardens is a must see.",
          "I photographed a wedding here this fall and despite living in the area for ten years, it was my first time checking it out. I took my kids to have a look around and they (4 and 6) loved it. My six year old loved pointing out all the things that he recognized from our garden",
          "Amazing place. Japanese Gardens best in Alberta that I've seen so far. Best to go when everything is in full bloom depending on season. They have a traditional Japanese bell that you can actually gong! The sound/frequency it emits carries through the entire landscape and is",

          "I think it would be better referred to as an arboretum personally. It was nice to walk around but do not expect sculpted English style gardens throughout. The only areas well maintained are the Japanese gardens and the indoor areas. It was nice to read the signs explaining what",
          "Not a bad choice if what u are looking for is some quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life\u2026..however, expected more varieties of botanics but found it to be lacking\u2026.",
          "Got there the last day of the season so much of the gardens were being winterized but still very beautiful - could spend the whole day there",

          "Only 30 minutes outside of Edmonton, this is a jewel for those who enjoy plants and a retreat from the city. Although the height of blooming season was over by August, we still thoroughly enjoyed strolling the paths of the gardens and enjoying the beautiful day and the diversity",
          "sight, smell, sound, and it all makes you feel warm. The bufferfly exhibit is quite something. worth a drive to have a stroll.",
          "Finally made a visit to this garden and it was worth the drive (although be warned once you leave the highway the abilities of other drivers seem to diminish). Quite a large place, allow yourself at least 2-3 hours or even a day to take in the sights and tranquility. Very well",
          "Pros: A little botanical garden with some nice flowers in bloom. Many of the flower beds were very colorful. Cons: There were many places where it was overgrown. I noticed several invasive weeds going out of control in spots (Most notably Verbascum thapsus/Common Mullien, which",
          "Mostly a pleasant place for a relaxing stroll and away from the busy rush of traffic etc. The Japanese gardens were very nice. We enjoyed a light picnic lunch by a large lake with local water birds and plants. Each section was separated well so that you didn't know what you",
          "Gardens are beautiful but very spread out. Not what I expected. Not enough washrooms plus the two there is very dirty.",
          "I found it was not worth the value and could go for a walk at a nice park and see pretty much the same. The butterflies were nice as was the asian gardens.",
          "Not a showy garden, maybe it was the time of year!!!! It is used very extensively for wedding venues and it does have many good backgrounds.",
          "A great way to spend a few hours wondering through lovely gardens. The highlight was probably the Japanese garden. A perfect place to sit and contemplate life!",
          "I just came back from here & have very mixed feelings. Some aspects were horrible (like the conditions of their main bathroom) or some things were beautiful like the Japanese garden area - the water wasn't running so the water features I was looking forward to seeing wasn't",
          "I like the location and intention of this place but think it is a little over priced. What makes it worth the journey is the small butterfly garden, particularly if you have kids. The Japanese gardens are peaceful and tranquil, while the other area offers diverse northern",

          "Devonian Botanical Garden is a haven from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day living. The manicured paths and gardens allow one to zone out and become one with nature...albeit man-made. We do need gardens like this to maintain plant diversity, educate the public and offer",

          "10/10. There were lots of flowers/plants to look at, despite coming on July 2, after most flowers had bloomed and already began drying out. Even so, there were some that were still waiting to bloom later in season. Definitely should come \u2026",
          "Recently went for my Daughter's school trip. We had a great time, and our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. Will definitely be back this summer to experience the entire area.",
          "Most importantly all family members can enjoy and experience this location. There is an accessable drop off zone, pathways are accessable and lots of helpful staff.  Some garden pathways (in the butterfly garden) need maintenance with two \u2026",
          "The garden were beautiful. A great place for families. The staff was all friendly and helpful. The Japanese Tea Ceremony was a great experience, while the martial arts demos were entertaining. The Kurimoto Garden was so peaceful and the Aga \u2026",
          "Had no idea that this even existed until the Amazing Race Canada went here. Who knew how beautiful this place was! Do it, just go here. Make sure you have an entire day to spend here",
          "Very dissapointed outrageous price for parking,the lights were very poorly put together,the cost was way out of hand,so now we are paying to see some Muslim exhibit,another example of some one else taking over and ripping off people, I \u2026",
          "Very beautiful.  Love the butterflies and Japanese garden",
          "Beautiful gardens! Came here on a field trip in June with my daughters class and it was so neat learning about some of the history and different types of plants and where they come from.",
          "While some areas are outstanding others are looking rather neglected. The food service is woefully inadequate for the size of the facility. Overall worthwhile but not living up to its potential.",
          "Fantastic.  Feeling guilty that I haven't been before though.  Even the paninis were good.  Highly recommend.",
          "Admission fee is very expensive. It is not an attractive place. I imagined a well arranged garden with flowers and trees, but it looks just a protective Canadian nature land. It is not interesting.",
          "A beautiful place to spend a day! Their date nights are great and well priced. Dont forget to go see the butterflies.",
          "Amazing, nice quiet peaceful walks.. new agha Khan garden is amazing.",
          "Amazing place. Such great views and smells. Kids are able to run around and have fun. Fish in the ponds are great too.",
          "A small but well managed park that the visitors are welcomed the minute you walked in the gift shop and entrance gate. The staff members are highly accommodating, professional and helpful.",
          "Most of the gardens were lovely, especially considering the climate.  Very much enjoyed the greenhouses.  The Aga Khan 'garden' was modernist, ugly and oppressive - not a spot you wanted to linger.  I wish the pond had continued on without the barbaric concrete angular addition.",
          "Beautiful place to spend a few hours walking around.",
          "Nice place to go and relax\nI like the new improvements and can't wait to see what else they do",

          "First time here ,lots to see and super fragrant trees to fill you with tranquility...loved it ..little tram that runs through is sweet",
          "The amount of detail put in this garden is spectacular. You find new things to take photos of all the time. You won't be disappointed!",
          "The best garden I have ever seen! Loved it.",
          "As part of the Luminaria event, I have to say the gardens were pretty, but not spectacular. It is cheap for each ticket and I know it's the first year doing it, but there was so much potential to make this a mind-blowing event and it just \u2026",
          "Beautiful,  peaceful, informative and I want to come back every time I visit Edmonton",
          "Love this place. The Aga Khan and the Japanese garden are the best, in my opinion.",
          "I think it\u2019s been about 15 years since I was last here, Wow! U of A has been busy, I was stunned, this place is amazing, so much more here than I remembered, I plan on revisiting in the fall when the leaves are changing.",
          "A must see place in Edmonton. Go with the kids family or on a date. Check their website for any upcoming events!",

          "The gardens are beautiful, well maintained and staff is friendly as well as helpful.  A great place to visit for the whole family!",
          "Pleasantly suprized. Japanese garden is stunning and AGA Kahn garden is just as impressive, leading to the rest of the collections. You can lay down a blanket for a picnic anywhere on the grass, but please make sure not to leave anything behind. The grounds are very clean so please do your part to keep it that way.",
          "Our second time here but our first time at the repeat sold out event Luminaria. It was a perfect evening out to listen to carolers, stroll through candlelit pathways, sip on some hot apple cider, freeze at the ice sculptures to gaze at the \u2026",
          "Very well managed. The new Aga Khan garden is quite a marvel.",
          "It was a beautiful summer day spent at the gardens. Would highly recommend it.",
          "So enjoyed my visit. Really wonderful. So peaceful. They have date night events on Thursday's. The butterfly area was so inspiring. They have a train if you would like to ease the walking, but I missed the time window.  They have a lovely \u2026",

          "Very nice. Renos and new areas very attractive. A must see.",
          "This place is awesome since the U of A have taken it over. The staff are friendly and the place is very well kept and has expanded. This is a Hidden Gem in Edmonton if you love The Great Outdoors and beautiful gardens. We are planning to have our wedding here in 2019 and cannot wait, it's going to be beautiful!",
          "Gorgeous location, a little small for the price point but overall a lovely place to go to if your in the area",
          "Not overly stroller friendly however the place is way bigger than it seems from the highway. Would recommend highly for any kind of garden lover.",
          "World class botanical displays. The Japanese Garden and newly completed Aga Khan Garden are well worth seeing.",
          "It was breathtaking! So many areas to explore and plants to appreciate, I will be back again, admission prices are very affordable.",
          "Very beautiful place. Here\u2019s the pictures of the Opera Al Fresco last night",
          "Lovely gardens, very clean. I had a good time listening to birdsong, seeing butterflies, and breathing fragrances.",
          "It was really cold which was rather sad was not able to stay long but it was absolutely beautiful.",
          "I was lucky enough to tour the new Aga Khan gardens before they officially opened. The gardens are amazing. I was impressed by the high-quality construction and design elements that are unique in Edmonton. Yes it is man made but man has \u2026",
          "What a wonderful place! Will be going back when the flowers are blooming. Great Experience!",
          "The area is very wide, and there are a lot of different kinds of plants. I just wished we went here during the time that most of the flowers have bloomed. The bathrooms are clean.",

          "The luminera was really nice!!",
          "A charming hidden gem, just West of Edmonton.\n\nExpect long line-ups for ice cream and other snacks at the cafe, but the wait is worth it.",
          "Incredibly peaceful atmosphere, wonderful selection of foliage. Blissful energy.",
          "Provides varied botanical programs",

          "Loved my experience. Lots of different trees, flowers and wide area to walk and relax",
          "Great place to visit! So beautiful.",
          "It is a serene meaningful place to walk through and listen to the guide talk about the Aga khan Garden.  The meaning of water and it's place amongst a surrounding forest.  We attended a wedding at the bottom of the cascade in the Chahar \u2026",
          "It's a beautiful place to take your kids and elders for a early morning or late afternoon trip. Offcours, it depends on temperature and weather. That's my recommendation for a hot day in middle of summer. Butterflies and tropical gardens \u2026",
          "Decent place.  I went end of July as I was close by and wanted to go for some time.  Entry price is outragious compared to gardens like VanDusen in Vancouver or Butchart Gardens in Victoria.  I wouldn't recommend this place.",
          "Excellent. Getting better by the day. Mushroom expo was great learning.",
          "Birthday party went really (7 year old). Kids had a blast.",
          "Great staff, got us to and from the wedding in the pouring rain as dry as possible.",

          "Beautiful garden and not too far from the city too. Friendly staff. One can usually stay some time after their closing hours, which is helpful. Wonderful place for photography, especially in autumn. The Aga Khan Garden (a part of this larger garden) is a lovely addition. Highly recommended.",
          "Love these gardens!!! My only complaint is lack of food and what is offered and it is extremely overpriced! I won\u2019t eat here again!",
          "Beautiful peaceful gardens. Just went there to kill a couple hours before our flight but would highly recommend for anyone visiting Edmonton.",
          "Surprised by how lovely everything was after the all the horrible weather we've had this summer. This was my first time seeing the Aga Khan garden and it is awesome.",
          "I mean it's not that bad place I would think of I like that place by the way",
          "Luminaria exceeded expectations this eve. We were warmly welcomed as volunteers and thoroughly enjoyed our full day of set up and light up. Good exercise, great food, gracious people and a beautiful display of lights...thanks, Devonian \u2026",

          "We fill in love with this place ....Take the Family and spend 4 hours in the paradise ..",
          "Beautiful and a great way to spend a few hours! The only reason I am taking off a star is because of the lack of signage. They do have maps, but there are a ton of little paths and whatnot that make it *very* difficult to navigate your way around. Signs pointing which way to the different areas and exhibits would be amazing!",
          "We were there for Opera el Fresco.I had not been at the gardens for years.So beautiful.I highly recommend taking time to visit them",
          "Lovely and meticulously kept gardens. It's a great place for a quiet walk and to enjoy an artistic slice of nature, with beautiful architectural highlights.\n\nThe \"Luminaria\" December event is especially a can't-miss -- exquisitely lit up, seeing the gardens come alive in the cold and dark of winter is an absolutely unique experience.",
          "My first visit to the Botanical Gardens. They were beautiful.",
          "Awesome place to take your child on a date. Very stroller friendly. Go mid week. It feels like you have the entire place to yourselves. Loved every minute of it. Great little cafe and ice cream store too.",
          "Great atmosphere, not expensive at all for the experience. Lines for the concession can be a bit long in the summer, but that's the way it goes.",
          "Took my nephews who are 5 & 8. They both had a great time especially in the butterfly house and Japanese garden. I was able to find two old digital cameras so they could take their own photos which they really enjoyed. \n\nWe were there for \u2026",
          "It's a beautiful garden area! A big walking area and a lot to see and photograph and all for a decent price of admission with a lot of parking space!",
          "Beautiful and unexpected. Perfect way to spend an afternoon.",
          "We hadn't been to these gardens for a number of years, and were missing the colours of spring, with things being so late in Calgary, so we went. Have they ever changed it around! The newest addition seems to be the amazing Aga Khan Garden, \u2026",
          "The big drawback is Patio Cafe.  A huge line of people.  Need to add another place with drinks.  You can die of thirst",
          "Amazing garden, lots of work to make it beautiful at the north of Canada.",

          "So nice and quiet. Great place to disconnect.",
          "Really nice place. I went in May but I would go in June when you are sure that all the flowers bloom and plants grow more",
          "Friendly enough staff...good walk.  The collections need work...like all BGs they look cash strapped. The Aga Khan 'Garden'?",
          "Beautiful garden...very nice place to spend summer days",
          "This is such a beautiful place to go and enjoy nature or science or rest. Never disapoints.",
          "We went to the Luminaria Event , was nice",
          "We wanted to see the garden gifted to Edmonton by the Aga Khan but it turns out it costs $18 per person. Why are we being charged for something that the Aga Khan gifted to the city? Gardens in many other cities like Toronto are free to \u2026",
          "Lovely place to stroll round with interesting themed gardens ,easy to get around ,and a cafe on site.",
          "Not sure many people know about it. It's beautiful!!",
          "Went with my two kids and my friend (and her two kids), I will say it was a great way to kill a day with the kids, I would however recommend a guided tour if you have older kids, this place might be a tad \"boring\" for older kids and the \u2026",
          "Intesting and beautiful, recently renovated but more could have been done with the funding they received.",
          "We hosted a bridal shower at the ozawa pavilion and it was just most amazing shower ever. We had the entire Japanese garden at our disposal and guests loved taking pictures and enjoyed themselves a lot. The pavilion itself was clean, \u2026",
          "Beautiful garden,best place to relax n rewind with family members around.",

          "Was a very relaxing, beautiful day exploring the grounds.",
          "Was there about two weeks ago, I was expecting a lot more flowers and exotic plants, but it's mostly trees and shrubs. The middle part where the water flows was just okay. For me, it's not worth the fee. I didn't even bother taking pictures \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing! It is a must see.",
          "A wonderful place to spend a day looking at all the plants and flowers.",
          "Everything was great, except that there is no shuttle service or public transport - meaning it's quite inaccessible to those without private vehicles. Also would be nice to see (seasonally) items made from all the things grown here rather \u2026",
          "Absolutely gorgeous! Especially the butterfly greenhouse!",
          "My fiance proposed to me here. Beautiful place.",
          "The U of A Botanical Gardens are so beautiful. I recommend taking the tram around the gardens to get an overview of all of it as the grounds are extensive and too much for many people to walk around all of it. Make sure you stop into the indoor Showhouses especially the Tropical House with butterflies.",
          "Great place for a relaxing garden,  well designed.",
          "Luminara is always beautiful",
          "Was very disappointed in my visit. I felt like I paid to walk in a city park.",

          "Very very nice a great place to spend the day",
          "The new Aga Khan Garden is very unique and worthy of a visit. The Japanese Garden is beautiful. Other areas are okay but aren't up to the same standard. Overall it is a nice garden.",

          "The butterfly enclosure and the stream are my favourite parts.",
          "So peaceful and lovely.",

          "Absolutely stunning and well kept! This was our first visit and we under estimated how mu h time we would need to wander all the area. We chose the butterfly area and the new Aga Khan gardens. Very beautiful and my children and husband all enjoyed ourselves. We will be back to wander the rest of the gardens when back in the area.",
          "Fantastic place for a picnic or a date. Lots of pretty flowers and neat specific areas containing certain types of plants. The Aga Khan garden is incredible",
          "Went to Luminaria with my family on Friday night and I have to say I was very disappointed. I was expecting a lot of lights and just a wow factor that wasn't there. There were poorly lit paths and a couple of half-melted ice sculptures and \u2026",
          "Did not live up to the hipe.",

          "There's a lot to see. Gorgeous flowers and plants.",
          "Beautiful gardens",
          "Completely remodeled. Gardens are very peaceful and location is nice and quiet. Beautiful facility for a wedding and catered dinner. Public food facilities are poor. The little kiosk is highly overpriced. I had a Ceasars salad and the amount of lettuce was less than a cup and it cost me 5.99.  Pack a lunch for sure.",
          "Truly a lovely, peaceful gardens to visit away from urban environment",
          "Must visit location! Beautiful!",

          "Always a pleasure going here.  They did a huge renovation and now it's even better.  Pack a lunch and bring the family for the day,  you won't be disappointed.",
          "Upgrades the past two years have really brought new life to this place. Great place to have a picnic and enjoy the beautiful grounds. Lots of events throughout the summer to enjoy",
          "Whenever I get tired of living in the city, this garden is my mini escape. My favourite is the Japanese garden- feel really good to take a walk in this section of the garden. There are many special events through out the year. Butterfly \u2026",
          "Had a great time here! You could be here for days, and not see everything they have to offer. My 1st time here, and we maybe saw half. Beautiful gardens, and architecture throughout. So much to be seen, and learned here. Only about a 15 minute drive west of the city."

          "This could be very good. It needs to have a guide on board who tells the history of the city, pertinent facts, etc. We took a 5 pm Sunday tour and did not have the buffet. Upon parking our car we walked to the trailer expecting an office. Instead a hand printed sign told us to",

          "Good place to bond with family!",
          "Fantastic experience! Extremely welcoming staff, tasty food, but nothing beats seeing the sunset in Edmonton on the North Saskatchewan River",
          "What a great experience to see the Edmonton Downton core at night!",
          "It was a wonderful, new way to experience Edmonton's beautiful river valley.",
          "The boat has been redone, the staff are incredible and even though I live in the area I really enjoyed our quick cruise. Regardless of whether you are a tourist or a resident. It is well worth the money and time.  So nice to see this \u2026",
          "Had a great time. The food was pretty good. We went on a rainy cold day so that definitely wasn\u2019t ideal. A bit overpriced but a must do for any couple.",
          "It was very good! Nice customer service.",
          "Great views. Lots of fun! Food was ok.",

          "Food was great, entertainment was alright, a little pricey",
          "Went for Canada Day buffet dinner and cruise. Not worth the $100 dollar per person price tag, here's why:\n\n- Exorbitant wait times in lines to get drinks and food\n- Extremely crowded\n- Tough to find tables and chairs\n- Drinks not included \u2026",
          "Great views,Great time, great service.",

          "It was a murder mystery night. The food was really good. So whoever catered this event was 4 stars. The rest was pretty mediocre. Floor was sticky, started an hour late because performers were late, but organizers didn't tell anyone they \u2026",
          "Most aspects of the Edmonton Queen are mediocre at best; the food, the service, the comfort. What is exceptional is the view and the novelty of it. So it's right that you should pay a premium for these features.  But, you're paying quiet the premium, and IMO, not even close to being worth it.",
          "All cleaned up and ready to go for another season!  Nice to see Edmonton from a different point of view.",
          "We had such a great time! I love our North Sask, and this was a beautiful way to enjoy the city. Price is right for date night and a bottle of wine.\n\nI will do this again, but the dinner sailing next time!",
          "What a lovely evening! Good value for money. We pre-ordered the pulled pork & beef sandwiches and they were delicious. Staff were helpful & friendly.",
          "It would be excellent if they would actually reply to their emails from people who seriously want to rent out the boat for events? Terrible business model...",

          "Nice evening cruise , oath good wine and friends. Try a sunset cruise for a nice date night!",
          "Excellent ride. Must do for anyone.",
          "Honestly enjoyed it!  My children had such a great day!  The weather was +31, the food was good and the staff were pleasant.",
          "Would have been a great experience if the music wasn't so loud. Why does a ferry need a DJ? Could hardly hear myself think.",
          "Took the 8pm bbq cruise tonight with friends. The renovated boat is better than ever. Drinks are reasonable and the atmosphere is fantastic. What a great way to spend a night in Edmonton.",

          "Fun, relaxing experience.",
          "Unfortunately we didn't get to get under the high level bridge due to water level. However, we received a voucher to attend again",
          "I was here with a group of 4 people for a dinner service on July 13th. When we arrived we were informed that there had been some problem with the food and we were not going to be receiving the food that had been advertised. We were told \u2026",
          "Nice little piece of history. The boat was running half an hour late though. The buffet was very over priced and not very impressive. I don't recommend getting the buffet. Overall it was a neat experience. However now that I've done it I would never do it again.",
          "My friend and attended your cruise Saturday afternoon. We very much enjoyed the cruise as this was our second time. The first time we were unable to cruise due to electrically issues. We were promptly refunded thus we really looking forward \u2026",
          "Lots of fun",
          "Went on Sunday evening on the last cruise.  Now I'm not sure if they're all like this but we sat on the boat for an hour doing nothing. When we finally took off I thought we'd go further than a few blocks looking at the few downtown \u2026",
          "Excellent customer service and staff. Would recommend hight. Thanks for the great time",
          "We went as a family 2+1(21month old).had very awesome experience.buffet was great;staff was awesome,helpful and friendly!worth to go!who ever complains about small kids are losers!there are two sets of time!want to be with adults,take 8pm cruise!",

          "Unfortunately the river was low so we were not able to go under the new bridge. The view was wonderful to see in the evening.",
          "For the price the food was mediocre and for a buffet you didn't get a lot good or choice and only coffee waa included. The ride was nice but if I was to go again I would only go for the ride and not get the buffet unless it was to be improved on.",
          "We have just got back from a great evening's cruise along the river the service was great and we met some great people along the way , I would say that it is best to get there quite early though to avoid long queues and be able to park nearby .",
          "Nice Buffet but even just the Cruise Bar service tasty food",
          "Do not go for the all inclusive all you get is cheeseburgers and finger food",
          "Things could be so much better with some work! Four of us went on the river boat last Friday for the $5 special on the 5pm run. We showed up about 40 minutes early and were expecting a huge lineup! We were shocked there were only 6 people \u2026",
          "Nice great to go again",
          "First time here, and find it just alright.",
          "New experience in Edmonton.",
          "It is unfortunate that the water level was too low for a sail. However, the security staff were great, drinks kept coming and NAIT had a terrific event for a pirate party. However, the food was limited to four items and it wasn't easy to \u2026",
          "The reason I am giving 2 stars is because of the brunch. The boat ride and views are awesome and the experience overall was fantastic. However, we did a saturday morning brunch and the brunch itself was a serious downfall. The eggs benedict \u2026",
          "Relaxing cruise, and good value for money with the BBQ dinner option.",
          "Summer escapade",
          "Felt like a tourist. Great food and overall experience.",

          "Super...!",
          "The only boat in Edmonton ",
          "Worth the cost of the ride for sure",
          "So I booked a dinner and Cruze for august and the day after I booked they called and said that there will no longer be a Cruze due to low water level ( witch they didn't bother to tell us before) then they told us it is non refundable and \u2026",

          "Never again",
          "good value",
          "Boat ride was fun, the food was mediocre",
          "Funish",
          "Very bad experience.The boat didn't move.It was always there on the dock and when asked about it they said due to low water level sailing is not possible.Then the sailing dinner cruise became a total waste of money.The food they have provided is also not worth the money.How can you expect     CAD 58.95 for these?",
          "THE  MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE HAD.A HALF OUR TO GET OUR FIRST DRINK,ONLY TO FIND OUT THEY HAD RUN OUT OF BEER BEFORE WE GOT STARTED.THE FOOD WAS ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE.AT $165.00 FOR TWO IT WAS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE,WILL NEVER GO AGAIN AND RECOMMEND OTHERS DON'T EITHER.",
